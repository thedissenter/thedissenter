00:00:00.409 --> 00:00:03.380
Hello, everyone. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:06.030
the Center. I'm your host, as always, Ricardo Lopez,

3
00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:09.149
and today I'm joined by Doctor Brian Lurch. He

4
00:00:09.149 --> 00:00:13.189
is a theoretical ecologist and evolutionary biologist who just

5
00:00:13.189 --> 00:00:16.379
received the PhD from the University of North Carolina

6
00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:19.500
Chapel Hill. And today we're going to talk about

7
00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:25.379
topics like same sex uh same-sex sexual behavior, indiscriminate

8
00:00:25.379 --> 00:00:30.620
sexual behavior, attachment, and divorce. So, Brian, welcome to

9
00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:32.409
the show. It's a pleasure to everyone.

10
00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:34.380
Yeah, thank you for having me. I'm excited to

11
00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:34.810
be here.

12
00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:41.580
So what is same sex sexual behavior? What does

13
00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:42.540
it include?

14
00:00:43.279 --> 00:00:46.740
Yeah, I would say that same-sex sexual behavior is

15
00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:52.380
any um attempted apparent sexual behavior between two members

16
00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:55.930
of the same sex. Uh, SO, kind of classic

17
00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:59.659
examples of this would be, uh, attempted courtship between

18
00:00:59.659 --> 00:01:02.340
two members of the same sex or attempted copulation

19
00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:06.220
between two members of the same sex. Um, IT

20
00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:09.879
is somewhat hard to define. Uh, BECAUSE, you know,

21
00:01:09.949 --> 00:01:11.519
what do we mean by sexual can be a

22
00:01:11.519 --> 00:01:14.470
bit of a gray area. This is especially true

23
00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:16.669
because a lot of, uh, or at least some

24
00:01:16.669 --> 00:01:20.230
examples of same-sex sexual behavior appear to be sexual

25
00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:23.239
behaviors that are co-opted for a different function, so.

26
00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:27.029
Uh, WHAT I mean by that is, examples, uh,

27
00:01:27.059 --> 00:01:29.849
like we see in some mammals, bison, some primates,

28
00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:33.180
where it appears that same-sex mountings are actually a

29
00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.220
dominance display. So it, it, it's a bit of

30
00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:38.970
a gray area to what extent that sexual behavior.

31
00:01:39.339 --> 00:01:43.379
Um, OTHER examples are like from Bonobos a really

32
00:01:43.379 --> 00:01:46.059
classic example where sexual behaviors appear to be used

33
00:01:46.059 --> 00:01:49.550
as, as a means of conflict resolution. Uh, SO

34
00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:52.339
again, a, a bit of a gray area, um.

35
00:01:53.099 --> 00:01:56.410
You know, I, I guess, uh, outside of, of

36
00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:59.819
the idea of same-sex copulation or same-sex mountings, there's

37
00:01:59.819 --> 00:02:02.500
other things like same-sex pair bonds that are sometimes

38
00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:05.150
included. Uh, YOU see this a lot in birds.

39
00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:06.519
Again, I think it's a bit of a gray

40
00:02:06.519 --> 00:02:09.020
area what what we mean by sexual, but that's

41
00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:11.470
broadly, uh, the types of things that people are

42
00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:14.529
talking about when, when discussing same-sex sexual behavior.

43
00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:19.410
Uh, BUT it isn't the same as homosexuality or

44
00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:19.960
is it?

45
00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:22.660
No, I would say it is not. So I

46
00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:26.820
would think of homosexuality as an example of same-sex

47
00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:32.100
sexual behavior. Uh, SO all, all examples of homosexuality,

48
00:02:32.179 --> 00:02:35.419
I would consider same-sex sexual behavior, uh, but not

49
00:02:35.419 --> 00:02:39.699
all same-sex sexual behavior, I would call homosexuality. I

50
00:02:39.699 --> 00:02:44.389
would say that homosexuality implies this sort of, um,

51
00:02:44.729 --> 00:02:48.889
Attraction for the same sex that uh in many

52
00:02:48.889 --> 00:02:52.410
examples in same-sex sexual behavior in animals, and probably

53
00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:54.360
a lot of the examples that we'll talk about,

54
00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:59.110
there isn't that apparent attraction, uh, necessarily, so I,

55
00:02:59.169 --> 00:03:01.570
I wouldn't consider them examples of homosexuality.

56
00:03:02.279 --> 00:03:07.600
Right, um, is same sex sexual behavior and an

57
00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:10.660
evolutionary conundrum, and if so,

58
00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:15.550
how, yeah, so I would say it really isn't

59
00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:19.380
an evolutionary conundrum, although it's often called that and

60
00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:22.389
it can seem like one, and the reason it

61
00:03:22.389 --> 00:03:30.059
can seem like one is essentially that Evolution or,

62
00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:32.750
or I should say natural selection, right, is, is

63
00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:36.710
kind of loosely speaking, trying to, to optimize how

64
00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:40.190
many offspring individuals are producing, trying to maximize that

65
00:03:40.649 --> 00:03:45.830
loosely speaking. And uh of course mating between members

66
00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:48.259
of the same sex are not going to directly

67
00:03:48.259 --> 00:03:50.869
result in offspring production. So the, the kind of

68
00:03:50.869 --> 00:03:53.990
logic behind calling it an evolutionary conundrum is that

69
00:03:54.429 --> 00:03:59.679
individuals are spending energy on. On attempted matings, they're

70
00:03:59.679 --> 00:04:02.889
spending time on attempted matings that are never going

71
00:04:02.889 --> 00:04:05.669
to result in offspring production. So in that sense,

72
00:04:05.679 --> 00:04:09.000
it it seems maladaptive and, and it often is

73
00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.520
referred to as a conundrum. The reason I would

74
00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:14.839
say that uh it's maybe a little bit unfair

75
00:04:14.839 --> 00:04:18.459
to call it an evolutionary conundrum, especially today, uh,

76
00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:21.000
maybe I would have felt differently, you know, decades

77
00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.200
ago, but there's now been decades of work that

78
00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:28.790
are clarifying why same-sex sexual behavior has evolved and,

79
00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:32.760
um, what some of the different uh evolutionary forces

80
00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:35.959
are that lead to same-sex sexual behavior and in

81
00:04:35.959 --> 00:04:39.989
particular lead to same-sex sexual behavior as being Uh,

82
00:04:40.059 --> 00:04:44.649
uh, uh, part of an adaptive strategy that individuals

83
00:04:44.649 --> 00:04:48.890
are taking when they're attempting reproduction and attempting to

84
00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:51.570
decide, uh, with whom to mate.

85
00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:55.690
OK, so tell us more about that. In what

86
00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:59.380
ways is it or can it be adaptive?

87
00:04:59.769 --> 00:05:03.119
Yeah, so a lot of the work on this

88
00:05:03.119 --> 00:05:06.570
comes from insects, and in a lot of these

89
00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:10.890
cases, essentially what it seems like is happening is

90
00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:17.450
that when individuals are in conditions where Uh, mating

91
00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:20.970
attempts are really mating opportunities are really hard to

92
00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:23.730
come by, you know, maybe you're living in a

93
00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:27.359
very low density conditions, uh, or maybe it's just

94
00:05:27.359 --> 00:05:31.290
that matings aren't very costly, right? Maybe, um, an

95
00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:34.809
attempted mating isn't actually that much energy expenditure. There

96
00:05:34.809 --> 00:05:37.730
isn't much of an opportunity cost, right, to, to

97
00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:40.920
attempted matings. In cases like this, it appears what

98
00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:44.010
happens or or what often is the case is

99
00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:50.010
that there Um, What selection, the, the strategy that

100
00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:54.339
selection has kind of resulted in is, is indiscriminate

101
00:05:54.339 --> 00:06:00.429
mating or imperfect sex discrimination, where individuals Don't spend

102
00:06:00.429 --> 00:06:04.190
the time or the energy to to be very

103
00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:07.190
selective about who they mate with. And as a

104
00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:10.279
byproduct of that strategy, you're getting same-sex sexual behavior,

105
00:06:10.429 --> 00:06:13.269
right? So in in cases where individuals are, are

106
00:06:13.269 --> 00:06:15.989
not very choosy and they're not choosy as an

107
00:06:15.989 --> 00:06:22.470
adaptation due to, like I said, low opportunity costs

108
00:06:22.869 --> 00:06:26.269
um to matings or maybe high opportunity costs to

109
00:06:26.269 --> 00:06:29.739
missing a mating. Under these conditions, you can get

110
00:06:29.739 --> 00:06:32.059
same-sex sexual behavior as as a part of an

111
00:06:32.059 --> 00:06:33.140
adaptive strategy.

112
00:06:34.679 --> 00:06:38.170
And I mean, if same sex sexual behavior is

113
00:06:38.170 --> 00:06:43.450
not the same as homosexuality, then it doesn't necessarily

114
00:06:43.450 --> 00:06:48.049
mean that individuals who practice these kinds of behaviors

115
00:06:48.049 --> 00:06:54.049
are necessarily homosexual or even exclusively homosexual, right? So

116
00:06:54.049 --> 00:06:57.679
they can still have uh sex with uh the

117
00:06:57.679 --> 00:07:01.290
opposite, with members from the opposite sex and appropriate.

118
00:07:01.839 --> 00:07:04.649
Yeah, yeah, and that's a really nice clarification that

119
00:07:04.649 --> 00:07:06.970
I should have said it, it's, that's exactly right.

120
00:07:07.089 --> 00:07:09.730
So in these examples that I'm talking about, what

121
00:07:09.730 --> 00:07:14.010
you're seeing is actually that um that individuals are

122
00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:20.850
Essentially just getting more matings overall, some of those

123
00:07:20.850 --> 00:07:22.380
are with members of the same sex, some of

124
00:07:22.380 --> 00:07:24.250
those are with members of the opposite sex, and,

125
00:07:24.299 --> 00:07:25.940
and there's, I would think of it as a

126
00:07:25.940 --> 00:07:28.859
bit of a trade-off between how choosy you are,

127
00:07:29.010 --> 00:07:32.179
how strongly you attempt to discriminate the sex of

128
00:07:32.179 --> 00:07:35.140
potential mating partners, and how many total matings you

129
00:07:35.140 --> 00:07:38.140
receive, right? And different forces can balance that trade-off

130
00:07:38.140 --> 00:07:42.089
in different ways, resulting in more overall matings and,

131
00:07:42.179 --> 00:07:45.130
and therefore also more matings with the opposite sex.

132
00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:50.989
Right. I, I mean, uh, I haven't prepared any

133
00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:55.480
questions about homosexuality itself, but since I asked you

134
00:07:55.480 --> 00:08:00.959
if same-sex sexual behavior is an evolutionary conundrum, what

135
00:08:00.959 --> 00:08:06.869
about homosexuality itself? Is it an evolutionary conundrum or

136
00:08:06.869 --> 00:08:07.200
not?

137
00:08:08.119 --> 00:08:10.429
No, so I still think the answer is no,

138
00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:13.230
um, and again it's because we sort of understand

139
00:08:13.320 --> 00:08:17.079
the mechanisms, right? So in behind, behind this behavior.

140
00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:21.359
So in the case of, um, homosexuality, which is

141
00:08:21.359 --> 00:08:24.760
really typically studied in humans, uh, we know there's

142
00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:29.239
sort of different, uh, factors, different genetic factors, as

143
00:08:29.239 --> 00:08:31.880
well as some epigenetic factors, so things about gene

144
00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:37.320
regulation that are going to, uh, Have some predictive

145
00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:41.239
power about an individual's sexual preferences. So some of

146
00:08:41.239 --> 00:08:46.280
the classic examples are ideas like uh what's known

147
00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:49.599
as sexually antagonistic selection. So it's the idea that

148
00:08:49.599 --> 00:08:53.679
there is some genes that are beneficial in one

149
00:08:53.679 --> 00:08:58.510
sex, but Um, result in lower fitness, less offspring

150
00:08:58.510 --> 00:09:02.150
production in the other sex. And so, uh, there's

151
00:09:02.150 --> 00:09:08.080
some evidence that, uh, genes controlling, um, sexual preference

152
00:09:08.469 --> 00:09:12.270
are under sexually antagonistic selection. So again, you know,

153
00:09:12.390 --> 00:09:15.349
not a conundrum. We understand sort of the evolutionary

154
00:09:15.349 --> 00:09:17.390
forces at work here and there's tons of examples

155
00:09:17.390 --> 00:09:21.849
of, of sexually antagonistic selection in other types of,

156
00:09:22.150 --> 00:09:25.030
of traits, genes that control other types of traits.

157
00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:30.320
Uh, THERE'S also the idea of over dominance. So,

158
00:09:30.530 --> 00:09:32.719
you know, we have two copies of each gene,

159
00:09:33.090 --> 00:09:37.289
and sometimes you can get these cases where if

160
00:09:37.289 --> 00:09:40.809
you have different versions of the gene, that tends

161
00:09:40.809 --> 00:09:42.650
to be beneficial, but then if you have two

162
00:09:42.650 --> 00:09:45.840
of the same version, that's detrimental. This is another

163
00:09:46.169 --> 00:09:49.609
uh common force that can be at play in

164
00:09:49.609 --> 00:09:54.059
evolution that has been linked to Uh, homosexual behavior

165
00:09:54.059 --> 00:09:57.940
or same sex preferences. Um, SO I wouldn't consider

166
00:09:57.940 --> 00:10:01.409
homosexual behavior an evolutionary conundrum either. I think we,

167
00:10:01.460 --> 00:10:04.380
we understand the forces at play that can result

168
00:10:04.380 --> 00:10:07.260
in its evolution, and those are forces that we

169
00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:09.140
see in a wide variety of traits.

170
00:10:10.349 --> 00:10:14.669
OK. So, uh, moving on to another topic, a

171
00:10:14.669 --> 00:10:17.659
sort of related topic, but still a different one.

172
00:10:17.909 --> 00:10:21.030
What is indiscriminate sexual behavior?

173
00:10:21.669 --> 00:10:29.049
Yeah, so indiscriminate sexual behavior is Essentially engaging or

174
00:10:29.049 --> 00:10:33.969
initiating sexual behavior without first making an attempt to

175
00:10:33.969 --> 00:10:37.890
discern or determine the sex of the potential partner.

176
00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:44.109
Uh, AND how has it evolved then,

177
00:10:44.599 --> 00:10:51.059
yeah, so. I would say, um, I guess a

178
00:10:51.059 --> 00:10:54.530
couple of things about how indiscriminate sexual behavior evolved.

179
00:10:54.859 --> 00:10:58.260
One is that, uh, as a couple of people

180
00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:01.340
have argued in the past really 10 years, it's

181
00:11:01.340 --> 00:11:04.460
likely ancestral. Uh, YOU know, I would think of

182
00:11:04.820 --> 00:11:09.820
indiscriminate sexual behavior as being the initial state for

183
00:11:09.820 --> 00:11:14.780
animals they're sexually reproducing, and what has to evolve

184
00:11:14.780 --> 00:11:17.960
is The fact that you're attempting to discriminate the

185
00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:23.940
sex of potential partners. And um, what this means

186
00:11:23.940 --> 00:11:27.530
is sort of the first, the first animals were

187
00:11:27.780 --> 00:11:32.450
likely broadcast spawners, sessile broadcast spawners, so this means

188
00:11:32.859 --> 00:11:36.460
essentially animals that aren't able to move, and the

189
00:11:36.460 --> 00:11:39.650
way they reproduce is by releasing gametes into the

190
00:11:39.650 --> 00:11:43.250
ocean, and then those gametes mix and results in

191
00:11:43.250 --> 00:11:46.770
the reproduction that way it's not like internal fertilization

192
00:11:47.260 --> 00:11:50.320
like we see in in mammals and and Vertebrates,

193
00:11:50.400 --> 00:11:58.489
most vertebrates, um, So indiscriminate sexual behavior. It was

194
00:11:58.750 --> 00:12:00.859
initially not something that had to evolve. It was

195
00:12:00.859 --> 00:12:07.260
something that was probably like the default state. However,

196
00:12:07.710 --> 00:12:11.929
there's also some evidence that more in more recent

197
00:12:11.929 --> 00:12:18.409
evolutionary time, there's likely been some transitions. Back to

198
00:12:18.409 --> 00:12:24.210
indiscriminate sexual behavior or um some cases where indiscriminate

199
00:12:24.210 --> 00:12:28.489
sexual behavior has re-evolved or at least persisted. And

200
00:12:29.320 --> 00:12:32.359
In those cases, how it evolved is actually quite

201
00:12:32.359 --> 00:12:34.320
similar to to what I was talking about before,

202
00:12:34.359 --> 00:12:40.010
this idea that If matings have a very low

203
00:12:40.010 --> 00:12:43.669
cost, or if there's a very high cost, uh,

204
00:12:43.690 --> 00:12:47.229
a high opportunity cost to missing a mating, then

205
00:12:47.489 --> 00:12:50.349
it probably doesn't pay to attempt to to discriminate

206
00:12:50.349 --> 00:12:53.969
the sex of potential partners. Um, AND I guess

207
00:12:53.969 --> 00:12:55.530
I can give a couple of examples of how

208
00:12:55.530 --> 00:12:58.330
that appears to have played out in nature. Um,

209
00:12:58.409 --> 00:13:01.520
SO there, there is some evidence, uh, certainly from,

210
00:13:01.809 --> 00:13:05.169
uh, common toads, but I suspect it's quite common

211
00:13:05.169 --> 00:13:09.419
among frogs and toads that essentially, uh, males are

212
00:13:09.419 --> 00:13:12.729
mating quite indiscriminately. They're in this pond, they come

213
00:13:12.729 --> 00:13:16.330
across another frog and they attempt amplexus, which is

214
00:13:16.330 --> 00:13:19.809
essentially just the, the kind of mating position of

215
00:13:19.809 --> 00:13:23.200
these frogs and If a male attempts amplexis with

216
00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:27.679
another male, the receiving male will let out a

217
00:13:27.679 --> 00:13:30.679
release call, essentially saying, uh, I'm another male, you

218
00:13:30.679 --> 00:13:32.359
know, you don't want to mate with me, and

219
00:13:32.359 --> 00:13:35.840
that first male will, you know, basically immediately release

220
00:13:35.840 --> 00:13:38.080
and go on looking for other mates, right? So

221
00:13:38.080 --> 00:13:41.109
that whole process is happening very quickly. There's very

222
00:13:41.109 --> 00:13:45.929
low costs to that interaction. So it doesn't. It

223
00:13:45.929 --> 00:13:49.530
doesn't really pay for selection to come up with

224
00:13:49.530 --> 00:13:51.809
a strategy to avoid that because it's just not

225
00:13:51.809 --> 00:13:53.650
a costly behavior in the first place. So this

226
00:13:53.650 --> 00:13:56.489
is one way that that indiscriminate sexual behavior might

227
00:13:56.489 --> 00:14:03.049
be maintained. Another example, um, that is less obviously

228
00:14:03.049 --> 00:14:06.010
indiscriminate but still at least in the same genre

229
00:14:06.010 --> 00:14:08.789
is, is, uh, cases of a a deep sea

230
00:14:08.789 --> 00:14:11.489
squid. I'm not sure it's common name, but there's

231
00:14:11.489 --> 00:14:15.570
this deep sea squid that um, Essentially there there's

232
00:14:15.570 --> 00:14:19.320
been observations of same-sex meetings. I think of it

233
00:14:19.320 --> 00:14:24.479
as sperm packets being deposited on other males. And

234
00:14:24.760 --> 00:14:27.840
in this case, what's been argued is that these

235
00:14:27.840 --> 00:14:31.400
squid living in the deep ocean at very low

236
00:14:31.400 --> 00:14:34.469
density, it's rare that you come across a conspecific.

237
00:14:34.739 --> 00:14:36.679
So if you do come across a conspecific, if

238
00:14:36.679 --> 00:14:40.719
you come across another squid of your species, then

239
00:14:41.479 --> 00:14:44.820
You really can't afford to not mate with that

240
00:14:45.320 --> 00:14:48.280
individual if they're a female, right? That might be

241
00:14:48.280 --> 00:14:52.989
your only chance to uh engage in reproduction to

242
00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:57.000
to produce offspring. So it just doesn't pay to

243
00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:59.000
figure out whether that's a male or a female,

244
00:14:59.010 --> 00:15:02.200
and, and the best strategy is to attempt mating

245
00:15:02.200 --> 00:15:06.590
whenever you come across a con specific. Um, SO

246
00:15:06.590 --> 00:15:08.780
those are some of the, some of the reasons

247
00:15:08.780 --> 00:15:11.429
that it has evolved. I think another reason that

248
00:15:11.429 --> 00:15:17.169
it's evolved that uh could be cases where The

249
00:15:17.169 --> 00:15:23.219
opposite sex just isn't distinguishable, right? So the thing,

250
00:15:23.500 --> 00:15:26.289
you know, as we're talking about sex discrimination and

251
00:15:26.369 --> 00:15:30.590
and attempting to mate with the opposite sex. Something

252
00:15:30.590 --> 00:15:33.309
that's kind of underlying all of that is the

253
00:15:33.309 --> 00:15:35.869
idea that you can figure out what sex potential

254
00:15:35.869 --> 00:15:39.880
partners are, right? And certainly there's probably, probably most

255
00:15:39.880 --> 00:15:41.590
animals that you look at, at least as a

256
00:15:41.590 --> 00:15:44.909
human, right, that's not immediately obvious and, and it

257
00:15:44.909 --> 00:15:47.830
seems like it's also in some cases not immediately

258
00:15:47.830 --> 00:15:52.150
obvious to those organisms themselves. Um, AND there's some

259
00:15:52.150 --> 00:15:55.469
actually really fun examples of this. So in in

260
00:15:55.469 --> 00:16:01.570
Litterina, uh, this, this genus of snails. Uh, MALE,

261
00:16:01.729 --> 00:16:04.700
like too, too much matings, too many, uh, male,

262
00:16:05.210 --> 00:16:07.520
too, too much attention from males, essentially, too many

263
00:16:07.520 --> 00:16:10.880
mating attempts for males can be costly to females.

264
00:16:11.289 --> 00:16:15.090
And in this high density population of Litterina, the

265
00:16:15.090 --> 00:16:20.250
females have evolved to lose sex-specific cues from their

266
00:16:20.250 --> 00:16:24.400
mucus. So in lower density populations in the mucus

267
00:16:24.400 --> 00:16:28.880
of these snails, there's essentially some chemicals that lets

268
00:16:28.880 --> 00:16:32.000
other snails know, hey, I'm a female, and in

269
00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:35.359
this population, the females because they're under so much

270
00:16:35.359 --> 00:16:40.099
male harassment. They've evolved to lose this sex-specific cue.

271
00:16:40.390 --> 00:16:42.630
So now if you're a male snail and you

272
00:16:42.630 --> 00:16:45.229
come across a trail, you don't know if it's

273
00:16:45.229 --> 00:16:47.270
a male or a female, right? You're sort of

274
00:16:47.270 --> 00:16:51.119
constrained to follow that trail and attempt to mate

275
00:16:51.549 --> 00:16:56.750
indiscriminately because the females have essentially hidden or concealed

276
00:16:56.750 --> 00:16:58.669
the identity of, of their sex.

277
00:17:00.900 --> 00:17:05.400
Right. Uh, I mean, do we have any idea

278
00:17:06.089 --> 00:17:11.020
when it comes to the evolutionary history of sexual

279
00:17:11.020 --> 00:17:17.079
behavior, if indiscriminate sexual behavior came first or if

280
00:17:17.079 --> 00:17:19.760
it was discriminate sexual behavior?

281
00:17:20.368 --> 00:17:24.468
So, so. Some people have argued, I think pretty

282
00:17:24.468 --> 00:17:29.009
convincingly, it makes logical sense that indiscriminate sexual behavior

283
00:17:29.598 --> 00:17:32.639
must have come first. So the idea here, like

284
00:17:32.639 --> 00:17:35.598
I said, the first sexually reproducing organisms were these

285
00:17:35.598 --> 00:17:39.879
sessile broadcast ones. So organisms that are or animals,

286
00:17:39.958 --> 00:17:42.279
animals that are kind of sitting still on the

287
00:17:42.279 --> 00:17:45.318
ocean floor and reproducing by releasing gametes into the

288
00:17:45.318 --> 00:17:48.598
ocean, and then those gametes mix and that results

289
00:17:48.598 --> 00:17:52.660
in reproduction. We had to get from that state

290
00:17:52.989 --> 00:17:55.670
to the state of every animal that we see

291
00:17:55.670 --> 00:17:59.550
reproducing today, from humans to insects, those organisms that

292
00:17:59.550 --> 00:18:05.709
have internal fertilization and with examples of of female

293
00:18:05.709 --> 00:18:11.510
targeting of of preferential um copulation attempts with members

294
00:18:11.510 --> 00:18:15.420
of the opposite sex, and the process of getting

295
00:18:15.420 --> 00:18:19.939
from the point of sessile broadcast spawners to Uh,

296
00:18:20.040 --> 00:18:23.920
to all the organisms we see today with internal

297
00:18:23.920 --> 00:18:28.479
fertilization and opposite sex preferences, presumably passed through a

298
00:18:28.479 --> 00:18:32.319
point where we had organisms that were capable of

299
00:18:32.319 --> 00:18:35.359
moving around that could express some more complex sexual

300
00:18:35.359 --> 00:18:40.709
behavior, but had not yet evolved um this strategy

301
00:18:40.709 --> 00:18:44.160
to specifically target members of the opposite sex. We

302
00:18:44.160 --> 00:18:46.150
believe that's the most likely scenario.

303
00:18:47.459 --> 00:18:51.609
Right. And and in what conditions is the indiscriminate

304
00:18:51.609 --> 00:18:55.199
sexual behavior and optimal strategy?

305
00:18:55.880 --> 00:18:58.989
Yeah, so we know uh a few different examples

306
00:18:59.739 --> 00:19:03.630
um of conditions that favor indiscriminate sexual behavior. A

307
00:19:03.630 --> 00:19:05.390
few of them are things that I've already touched

308
00:19:05.390 --> 00:19:07.900
on, right? So if mating is not very costly,

309
00:19:08.109 --> 00:19:11.229
like we saw in that common toad example, then

310
00:19:11.229 --> 00:19:14.500
this is something that's gonna favor indiscriminate sexual behavior.

311
00:19:14.949 --> 00:19:19.390
If you're really rarely encountering members of the opposite

312
00:19:19.390 --> 00:19:22.170
sex. Which is essentially to say if there's a

313
00:19:22.170 --> 00:19:24.869
really high cost to missing a mating, like we

314
00:19:24.869 --> 00:19:26.739
saw in that example of the deep sea squid,

315
00:19:27.069 --> 00:19:30.069
then this is another uh another set of conditions

316
00:19:30.069 --> 00:19:33.550
that's going to favor indiscriminate sexual behavior. Something that

317
00:19:33.550 --> 00:19:36.069
we haven't touched on that's actually been probably the

318
00:19:36.069 --> 00:19:40.699
most extensively studied empirically is the idea of biased

319
00:19:40.699 --> 00:19:47.770
sex ratios. So if you are a male and

320
00:19:48.630 --> 00:19:52.219
Most, and you're in a strongly female biased environment,

321
00:19:52.390 --> 00:19:54.550
so you're one of the only males, then it

322
00:19:54.550 --> 00:19:57.199
might not pay to really worry too much about

323
00:19:57.199 --> 00:20:03.569
sex discrimination because Most, if you mate indiscriminately and

324
00:20:03.569 --> 00:20:06.810
most con specifics are female, then most of your

325
00:20:06.810 --> 00:20:09.920
matings will be with females. So you're kind of,

326
00:20:10.250 --> 00:20:13.489
you know, you're getting preferential female matings for free

327
00:20:13.489 --> 00:20:15.930
essentially. On the other hand, in conditions that are

328
00:20:15.930 --> 00:20:19.410
highly male biased, where if most individuals that you

329
00:20:19.410 --> 00:20:22.969
mate with are going to be males, then those

330
00:20:22.969 --> 00:20:25.750
are conditions that are going to make it. Especially

331
00:20:25.750 --> 00:20:31.739
favorable to uh engage in or to evolve sex

332
00:20:31.739 --> 00:20:35.300
discrimination because that's really what's going to allow you

333
00:20:35.300 --> 00:20:37.859
to start to preferentially mate with females, right? The

334
00:20:37.859 --> 00:20:40.540
costs and benefits of sex discrimination are really tightly

335
00:20:40.540 --> 00:20:45.930
linked to the adult sex ratio. Um, AND interestingly,

336
00:20:46.050 --> 00:20:47.859
so this, this kind of logic of what I

337
00:20:47.859 --> 00:20:49.930
said comes from theory, but interestingly, as far as

338
00:20:49.930 --> 00:20:52.010
I know, there's one study that actually looks at

339
00:20:52.010 --> 00:20:56.089
this empirically that sets up experimental evolution. They watch

340
00:20:56.089 --> 00:21:01.410
evolution in the lab under uh bias sex ratios

341
00:21:01.410 --> 00:21:05.750
in uh red flower beetles, tribolium, and they see

342
00:21:05.750 --> 00:21:09.130
this exact trend that I described where The males

343
00:21:09.130 --> 00:21:13.089
that are reared over many generations at a 9

344
00:21:13.089 --> 00:21:17.109
to 1 male bias sex ratio evolve much stronger

345
00:21:17.109 --> 00:21:21.729
sex discrimination than males that are are reared over

346
00:21:21.729 --> 00:21:25.729
multiple generations at a 1 to 9 female biased

347
00:21:25.729 --> 00:21:26.569
sex ratio.

348
00:21:29.180 --> 00:21:34.390
So would there be any relationship between indiscriminate sexual

349
00:21:34.390 --> 00:21:39.369
behavior and the evolution of same-sex sexual behavior?

350
00:21:40.329 --> 00:21:44.760
Yes, absolutely. So, I would think of same-sex sexual

351
00:21:44.760 --> 00:21:49.069
behavior as being a byproduct of indiscriminate sexual behavior,

352
00:21:49.280 --> 00:21:53.680
right? Indiscriminate sexual behavior is one reason that you

353
00:21:53.680 --> 00:21:56.800
might see same-sex sexual behavior. There's other reasons you

354
00:21:56.800 --> 00:21:58.959
might see same-sex sexual behavior, some of those we

355
00:21:58.959 --> 00:22:04.949
touched on. Um, BUT in cases where individuals are

356
00:22:04.949 --> 00:22:09.800
mating indiscriminately, then necessarily if they encounter a member

357
00:22:09.800 --> 00:22:11.920
of the same sex, they're going to attempt to

358
00:22:11.920 --> 00:22:14.719
mate with them, and you're gonna get same-sex sexual

359
00:22:14.719 --> 00:22:16.739
behavior as a result, right? And this is kind

360
00:22:16.739 --> 00:22:19.359
of the idea that I was talking about earlier

361
00:22:19.359 --> 00:22:23.760
when I said that um same sex sexual behavior

362
00:22:23.760 --> 00:22:27.449
can be a part of a larger adaptive strategy,

363
00:22:27.599 --> 00:22:30.640
right? There's cases like we've just talked about that.

364
00:22:31.520 --> 00:22:37.239
Favor indiscriminate sexual behavior, uh, evolutionarily and in those

365
00:22:37.239 --> 00:22:40.839
cases, as a part of indiscriminate sexual behavior, you're

366
00:22:40.839 --> 00:22:43.510
going to see some same-sex sexual behavior as well.

367
00:22:44.400 --> 00:22:48.880
Mhm. So earlier I asked you if, uh, what

368
00:22:48.880 --> 00:22:53.439
came, what came first discriminate sexual behavior or indiscriminate

369
00:22:53.439 --> 00:23:00.189
sexual behavior, but, uh, does indiscriminate sexual behavior relate

370
00:23:00.189 --> 00:23:04.119
in any way to the evolution of discriminate sexual

371
00:23:04.119 --> 00:23:04.589
behavior?

372
00:23:05.890 --> 00:23:07.400
Yeah, so I guess what I would say to

373
00:23:07.400 --> 00:23:10.640
that is I would sort of think of this

374
00:23:10.640 --> 00:23:16.329
is a big continuum. From completely indiscriminate sexual behavior

375
00:23:16.329 --> 00:23:20.959
to where, uh, whenever an individual is encountering a

376
00:23:20.959 --> 00:23:23.660
con specific, they're attempting to meet, or maybe if

377
00:23:23.660 --> 00:23:27.780
they're even encountering uh members of the opposite sex

378
00:23:27.780 --> 00:23:29.819
or something, or I'm sorry, members of a different

379
00:23:29.819 --> 00:23:33.380
species or uh something that maybe looks like a

380
00:23:33.380 --> 00:23:35.619
con specific, but isn't actually, right? There there's kind

381
00:23:35.619 --> 00:23:37.540
of a lot of flavors of of what could

382
00:23:37.540 --> 00:23:40.739
be indiscriminate sexual behavior. This is all on one

383
00:23:40.739 --> 00:23:43.709
extreme of the continuum. The other extreme of the

384
00:23:43.709 --> 00:23:46.800
continuum would be a case where there is perfect

385
00:23:46.800 --> 00:23:51.579
sex discrimination. Individuals always know and are always correct

386
00:23:51.989 --> 00:23:56.020
about what's a male and what's a female. And

387
00:23:56.020 --> 00:23:59.300
individuals will only attempt to meet once they are

388
00:23:59.300 --> 00:24:02.180
positive that they've identified what's a male and what's

389
00:24:02.180 --> 00:24:05.739
a female. This kind of perfectly discriminate sexual behavior,

390
00:24:05.780 --> 00:24:09.939
this is another extreme of a continuum. At the

391
00:24:09.939 --> 00:24:13.449
same time, there's all of these different examples of

392
00:24:13.449 --> 00:24:18.170
imperfect sex discrimination, right? Maybe individuals are more likely

393
00:24:18.170 --> 00:24:21.380
to mate with members of the opposite sex, but

394
00:24:21.380 --> 00:24:24.420
because there's so much variation between what a male

395
00:24:24.420 --> 00:24:26.540
looks like and what a female looks like, maybe

396
00:24:26.540 --> 00:24:29.420
sometimes, you know, they don't identify males and females

397
00:24:29.420 --> 00:24:32.380
correctly or or selection has shaped. Kind of a

398
00:24:32.380 --> 00:24:36.219
strategy that allows them to be somewhat permissive about

399
00:24:36.219 --> 00:24:38.760
how confident do they need to be about the

400
00:24:38.760 --> 00:24:41.420
sex of a potential mating partner before they attempt

401
00:24:41.420 --> 00:24:43.819
to mate, right? And and this is the idea

402
00:24:43.819 --> 00:24:48.229
of imperfect sex discrimination. I think that imperfect sex

403
00:24:48.229 --> 00:24:53.060
discrimination is probably more common than completely indiscriminate sexual

404
00:24:53.060 --> 00:24:57.280
behavior. The idea that there's some sex discrimination. Um,

405
00:24:57.290 --> 00:25:00.630
BUT there's often going to be cases where, uh,

406
00:25:00.890 --> 00:25:03.290
the, the, what some have referred to as the

407
00:25:03.290 --> 00:25:06.160
mating filter. How confident do you need to be

408
00:25:06.930 --> 00:25:09.680
when you're attempting to mate with a con specific

409
00:25:09.680 --> 00:25:12.250
is broad enough that you're getting, you know, quite

410
00:25:12.250 --> 00:25:15.680
a bit of same-sex mating as a result. Um,

411
00:25:16.130 --> 00:25:18.130
SO really this is, this is kind of the

412
00:25:18.130 --> 00:25:20.050
continuum I would, I would think about and like

413
00:25:20.050 --> 00:25:23.520
we discussed, you, you probably saw conditions that started

414
00:25:23.520 --> 00:25:27.040
on the indiscriminate end of that continuum. But what

415
00:25:27.040 --> 00:25:31.880
we've seen throughout the evolution of animals is uh

416
00:25:31.880 --> 00:25:35.839
species filling essentially every gap on that continuum, right?

417
00:25:35.920 --> 00:25:39.599
There, there is a wide range of different strengths

418
00:25:39.599 --> 00:25:44.400
of sex sex discrimination that we see, um, and

419
00:25:44.719 --> 00:25:46.760
in this way we've kind of gotten the evolution

420
00:25:46.760 --> 00:25:51.319
of sex discrimination from this starting point, presumed starting

421
00:25:51.319 --> 00:25:53.160
point of indiscriminate sexual behavior.

422
00:25:54.819 --> 00:25:58.839
So let me ask you now about mate attachment.

423
00:25:58.920 --> 00:26:02.109
How did mate attachment evolve?

424
00:26:02.719 --> 00:26:07.160
Yeah. So let me start by maybe defining what

425
00:26:07.160 --> 00:26:12.400
we mean by attachment and uh and where and

426
00:26:12.400 --> 00:26:15.479
how we see it and can observe it. So,

427
00:26:16.589 --> 00:26:22.030
I would define attachment as a pair bond strengthening

428
00:26:22.030 --> 00:26:24.910
through time. So a pair bond being, you know,

429
00:26:25.069 --> 00:26:32.239
two individuals that are in a socially monogamous relationship

430
00:26:32.530 --> 00:26:39.119
that that's resulting in offspring production. If How those

431
00:26:39.119 --> 00:26:44.540
individuals. Basically feel about each other is becoming stronger

432
00:26:44.540 --> 00:26:46.420
through time than we could say that they're becoming

433
00:26:46.420 --> 00:26:48.939
attached, right? We're we're sort of anthropomorphizing a little

434
00:26:48.939 --> 00:26:52.939
bit um in doing that, but I think there

435
00:26:52.939 --> 00:26:56.349
is, there's a way to operationalize that which is

436
00:26:56.349 --> 00:26:59.939
essentially how likely are is that monogamous pair to

437
00:26:59.939 --> 00:27:05.589
stay together. So, In behavioral ecology, evolutionary biology, we,

438
00:27:05.599 --> 00:27:09.869
we refer to monogamous pairs splitting up as divorce.

439
00:27:10.199 --> 00:27:16.119
Speaking of anthropomorphizing, um, so if you get the

440
00:27:16.119 --> 00:27:19.189
likelihood of divorce, the sort of propensity for that

441
00:27:19.310 --> 00:27:25.489
pair bond. To split up, reducing the longer the

442
00:27:25.489 --> 00:27:28.010
pair has been together, then we could think of

443
00:27:28.010 --> 00:27:30.829
this as a way to operationalize what we mean

444
00:27:31.170 --> 00:27:35.400
by attachment. So, of course, in kind of human

445
00:27:35.400 --> 00:27:38.160
pair bonds, we can just ask about, you know,

446
00:27:38.390 --> 00:27:42.560
feelings individuals have for each other and infer attachment

447
00:27:42.560 --> 00:27:46.910
based on the answers to those questions. We can't

448
00:27:46.910 --> 00:27:49.469
do that with non-human animals. We're talking about these

449
00:27:49.469 --> 00:27:52.920
internal states that we don't have access to. So

450
00:27:52.920 --> 00:27:54.479
it's a little bit harder to infer it, but,

451
00:27:54.569 --> 00:27:58.239
but we can use evidence, um, such as the

452
00:27:58.239 --> 00:28:01.280
fact that the same hormones are are mediating pair

453
00:28:01.280 --> 00:28:07.239
bonding across taxa, uh, so things like oxytocin, vasopressin,

454
00:28:07.479 --> 00:28:11.319
dopamine, uh, and, and the homologs, the, the kind

455
00:28:11.319 --> 00:28:17.510
of analogs of, um, those hormones in Very divergent

456
00:28:17.510 --> 00:28:21.420
taxes, so things like birds. The fact that these

457
00:28:21.420 --> 00:28:27.910
same hormones appear to Um, appear to control the

458
00:28:27.910 --> 00:28:31.390
process of pair bonding so widely and because these

459
00:28:31.390 --> 00:28:35.699
hormones have been specifically implicated in the formation of

460
00:28:35.699 --> 00:28:39.260
pair bonds and feelings of romantic attachment in humans,

461
00:28:39.790 --> 00:28:43.060
we can use this as kind of uh we

462
00:28:43.109 --> 00:28:45.630
we can think of this as maybe providing hints

463
00:28:45.630 --> 00:28:49.160
that we do see attachment more broadly. So that's

464
00:28:49.160 --> 00:28:51.439
just me setting the stage of what we mean

465
00:28:51.439 --> 00:28:52.880
by attachment because I do want to be a

466
00:28:52.880 --> 00:28:55.640
little bit careful because again we're we're using these

467
00:28:55.640 --> 00:28:59.319
words that are a bit loaded, um, and, and

468
00:28:59.319 --> 00:29:01.160
I think it's important to be careful to, to

469
00:29:01.160 --> 00:29:03.400
be precise about what we mean in cases like

470
00:29:03.400 --> 00:29:10.670
that, um. Then how attachment can evolve is essentially,

471
00:29:11.130 --> 00:29:13.329
or at least one reason and something that we

472
00:29:13.329 --> 00:29:18.239
showed is that it it can prevent maladaptive divorce.

473
00:29:19.160 --> 00:29:24.579
In Uh, kind of in the presence of imperfect

474
00:29:24.579 --> 00:29:28.430
information. So to unpack that a little bit, imagine

475
00:29:28.430 --> 00:29:31.109
that, and there's a lot of evidence that this

476
00:29:31.109 --> 00:29:34.550
is the case, that divorce in birds is following

477
00:29:34.550 --> 00:29:38.270
periods of low reproductive success. So if, if a

478
00:29:38.270 --> 00:29:41.510
pair of birds, uh, has a nest failure and

479
00:29:41.510 --> 00:29:44.829
no offspring are produced, then you're more likely to

480
00:29:44.829 --> 00:29:50.810
see divorce occurring. Likely because individuals are using the

481
00:29:50.810 --> 00:29:55.829
information they received. From that nest failure to infer

482
00:29:56.040 --> 00:29:59.829
that either their mate is low quality, their territory

483
00:29:59.829 --> 00:30:04.060
is low quality, something is Bad about the situation

484
00:30:04.060 --> 00:30:09.040
that they find themselves in. So you can imagine

485
00:30:09.040 --> 00:30:11.520
though that or you can, you know, it's important

486
00:30:11.520 --> 00:30:17.270
to realize that that information coming from low reproductive

487
00:30:17.270 --> 00:30:21.589
success is imperfect, right? Maybe they just got unlucky,

488
00:30:21.880 --> 00:30:25.510
maybe their territory isn't bad, maybe their mate isn't

489
00:30:25.510 --> 00:30:30.319
of low quality. Maybe there's just, you know, some

490
00:30:30.319 --> 00:30:33.560
low random probability that the predator comes and and

491
00:30:33.560 --> 00:30:38.530
takes the nest wherever they are, or Um, maybe

492
00:30:38.900 --> 00:30:40.670
it's just a bad year, right? There is a

493
00:30:40.670 --> 00:30:45.020
drought, something like this, something random stochastic is leading

494
00:30:45.020 --> 00:30:50.530
to low reproductive success. What attachment allows individuals to

495
00:30:50.530 --> 00:30:55.089
do is to not overreact to bad luck, right?

496
00:30:55.170 --> 00:30:57.640
What it allows individuals to do is say, OK,

497
00:30:57.969 --> 00:31:01.729
I've spent 5 breeding seasons with this mate on

498
00:31:01.729 --> 00:31:06.130
this territory, and we've been successful each time. So

499
00:31:06.130 --> 00:31:08.959
now that I have one period of low reproductive

500
00:31:08.959 --> 00:31:16.819
success, rather than using that imperfect information to Infer

501
00:31:16.819 --> 00:31:19.339
potentially incorrectly that my mate is low quality, that

502
00:31:19.339 --> 00:31:22.140
my territory is low quality. I'm gonna kind of

503
00:31:22.140 --> 00:31:24.300
use all of that information. I'm gonna use the

504
00:31:24.300 --> 00:31:26.859
fact that I've been with my mate for 5

505
00:31:26.859 --> 00:31:30.579
years already to say, OK, you know, let's give

506
00:31:30.579 --> 00:31:33.180
this another chance, right? Let, let's let's try again

507
00:31:33.459 --> 00:31:36.430
next breeding season and, and not divorce yet. So

508
00:31:36.430 --> 00:31:39.500
this is the hypothesis that we've put forward for

509
00:31:39.989 --> 00:31:43.189
why attachment might be able to evolve, uh, and

510
00:31:43.189 --> 00:31:48.469
the importance of imperfect information in driving that evolution.

511
00:31:49.910 --> 00:31:53.569
Right. So, tell us a little bit more about

512
00:31:53.569 --> 00:31:58.020
the factors that favor the evolution of mate attachment.

513
00:31:58.099 --> 00:32:01.859
You mentioned there, uh, divorce, for example, but in

514
00:32:01.859 --> 00:32:05.530
your work, I also read about high survival rates,

515
00:32:05.780 --> 00:32:10.339
divorce propensities, probabilities of nest failure. So tell us

516
00:32:10.339 --> 00:32:12.140
a little bit more about that.

517
00:32:12.459 --> 00:32:15.219
Yeah, so the, the theory suggests that there are

518
00:32:15.219 --> 00:32:18.050
3 factors that are really important for the evolution

519
00:32:18.050 --> 00:32:21.130
of, of this type of attachment. The first factor

520
00:32:21.130 --> 00:32:26.530
is survival. So attachment uh is only able to

521
00:32:26.530 --> 00:32:31.530
evolve in relatively long-lived species, species with high survival

522
00:32:31.530 --> 00:32:36.209
rates, low mortality, low adult mortality rates. And there's

523
00:32:36.209 --> 00:32:38.569
2 reasons for this, for where the intuition comes

524
00:32:38.569 --> 00:32:40.660
from, for why high survival is important for attachment.

525
00:32:41.619 --> 00:32:45.650
The first one is that high survival puts individuals

526
00:32:45.650 --> 00:32:48.650
in control over whether or not they're staying with

527
00:32:48.650 --> 00:32:52.439
their mate. And the way to think about this

528
00:32:52.439 --> 00:32:59.959
is that if If mortality is really high. Then

529
00:33:00.010 --> 00:33:03.010
there's a high probability your mate's gonna die, right?

530
00:33:03.089 --> 00:33:05.650
So it doesn't, it doesn't really matter if you

531
00:33:05.650 --> 00:33:10.569
become attached to them or not, because these external

532
00:33:10.569 --> 00:33:13.329
factors might split up your pair anyways, right? You

533
00:33:13.329 --> 00:33:15.890
might have to find a new mate just due

534
00:33:15.890 --> 00:33:21.920
to, just due to your mate dying. So it's

535
00:33:21.920 --> 00:33:24.810
only under cases with high survival that attachment can

536
00:33:24.810 --> 00:33:28.869
really operate to keep pairs together. But the second

537
00:33:28.869 --> 00:33:31.469
reason that high survival is important or or maybe

538
00:33:31.469 --> 00:33:34.420
a second angle to think of that same factor

539
00:33:34.750 --> 00:33:37.939
is that it's going to allow benefits to accrue,

540
00:33:38.109 --> 00:33:41.089
right? If survival is high, then those are the

541
00:33:41.089 --> 00:33:44.150
cases that you're going to get the the most

542
00:33:44.150 --> 00:33:48.310
time with the same partner, and that's going to

543
00:33:48.310 --> 00:33:52.540
be kind of the most favorable conditions to where

544
00:33:53.060 --> 00:33:56.319
You're able to just stick around and not have

545
00:33:56.319 --> 00:33:58.280
to worry about going and finding a different meat.

546
00:33:59.339 --> 00:34:03.750
Yeah, that's why survival is important. Uh, DIVORCE, and

547
00:34:03.750 --> 00:34:07.709
the overall propensity to divorce is another reason or

548
00:34:07.709 --> 00:34:10.510
another factor that's going to be really important for

549
00:34:10.510 --> 00:34:14.350
the evolution of attachment. And again, it's going to

550
00:34:14.350 --> 00:34:18.750
be cases where divorce propensity is high. Individuals are

551
00:34:18.750 --> 00:34:22.228
actually quite likely to get divorced quickly. That's going

552
00:34:22.228 --> 00:34:25.708
to favor attachment. So that's a little counterintuitive maybe

553
00:34:25.708 --> 00:34:27.899
because it feels like it's going in opposite directions.

554
00:34:28.149 --> 00:34:32.100
The intuition for this is essentially that When are

555
00:34:32.100 --> 00:34:33.899
you with the mate but not yet attached to

556
00:34:33.899 --> 00:34:38.010
them? Well, that's early on in your pair. What

557
00:34:38.010 --> 00:34:40.649
if your mates actually low quality? Well, in those

558
00:34:40.649 --> 00:34:42.550
cases, you don't want to get attached to them,

559
00:34:42.810 --> 00:34:46.810
right? In those cases, it's better if you divorce,

560
00:34:47.129 --> 00:34:49.889
if you split up before attachment has a chance

561
00:34:49.889 --> 00:34:53.899
to operate. High divorce propensities are going to allow

562
00:34:53.899 --> 00:34:56.620
that to happen, right? If you're in a bad,

563
00:34:57.030 --> 00:34:59.590
if your mate is low quality, if you're on

564
00:34:59.590 --> 00:35:04.149
a bad territory. Then you want to leave that

565
00:35:04.399 --> 00:35:08.199
pairing quickly so that attachment doesn't occur because attachment

566
00:35:08.199 --> 00:35:10.879
can be maladaptive, right? If you are on a

567
00:35:10.879 --> 00:35:13.439
bad territory, if you do have a low quality

568
00:35:13.439 --> 00:35:16.639
mate, then it's not going to be beneficial. It

569
00:35:16.639 --> 00:35:19.479
will be detrimental to become attached to them. High

570
00:35:19.479 --> 00:35:25.550
divorce propensities will allow, will prevent that maladaptive expression

571
00:35:25.550 --> 00:35:28.000
of attachment. It will allow the pair to split

572
00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:32.419
up before attachment can occur. And the third condition

573
00:35:32.419 --> 00:35:34.780
I would think of as favoring the evolution of

574
00:35:34.780 --> 00:35:37.500
attachment is what I'll call living in a harsh

575
00:35:37.500 --> 00:35:41.159
environment. So these are going to be cases where

576
00:35:41.449 --> 00:35:44.500
whether you're On a good territory or in a

577
00:35:44.500 --> 00:35:46.780
poor territory. Whether you have a high quality meat

578
00:35:46.780 --> 00:35:49.340
or you have a low quality meat. There's a

579
00:35:49.340 --> 00:35:51.659
pretty high chance that sometimes your nest is just

580
00:35:51.659 --> 00:35:55.219
gonna fail because environmental conditions are harsh. There's a

581
00:35:55.219 --> 00:35:57.139
high chance that you just won't get to reproduce.

582
00:35:58.280 --> 00:36:01.439
And there's two reasons, again, from kind of two

583
00:36:01.439 --> 00:36:03.959
different angles that harsh environments are going to favor

584
00:36:03.959 --> 00:36:07.040
the evolution of attachment. So before I go into

585
00:36:07.040 --> 00:36:10.360
those, let me just quickly go back to this

586
00:36:10.360 --> 00:36:14.510
idea that, OK, if you have a low quality

587
00:36:14.510 --> 00:36:18.070
reproductive situation, a low quality mate, a poor territory,

588
00:36:18.320 --> 00:36:20.860
you don't want to get attached. It's in those

589
00:36:20.860 --> 00:36:25.540
conditions that attachment is maladaptive. Whereas if you have

590
00:36:25.959 --> 00:36:28.280
a high quality mate or you're on a good

591
00:36:28.280 --> 00:36:30.879
territory, you do want to get attached, right? Because

592
00:36:30.879 --> 00:36:34.679
in those cases, uh, you're not gonna overreact to

593
00:36:34.679 --> 00:36:38.979
getting unlucky. Essentially what a harsh environment is going

594
00:36:38.979 --> 00:36:41.010
to do is it's going to make it more

595
00:36:41.010 --> 00:36:43.219
likely that attachment is what keeps you in a

596
00:36:43.219 --> 00:36:48.209
good situation and less likely that attachment will erroneously

597
00:36:48.209 --> 00:36:51.540
be expressed in a bad situation, right? So if

598
00:36:51.540 --> 00:36:54.489
you're on a good territory and you've become attached,

599
00:36:54.820 --> 00:36:57.419
but the environment is harsh, you're just gonna get

600
00:36:57.419 --> 00:37:00.540
unlucky a lot. You're gonna have lower reproductive success

601
00:37:00.540 --> 00:37:03.260
due to that bad luck. So it's under those

602
00:37:03.260 --> 00:37:06.939
conditions that attachment really pays off because it's preventing

603
00:37:06.939 --> 00:37:13.540
you from overreacting to the the um unlucky circumstances

604
00:37:13.540 --> 00:37:16.580
that led to that low reproductive success. On the

605
00:37:16.580 --> 00:37:21.550
flip side of that, if Bad, if poor territories,

606
00:37:21.560 --> 00:37:26.270
if low reproductive, low quality reproductive opportunities are really

607
00:37:26.270 --> 00:37:31.629
bad, then it's unlikely that you get lucky early

608
00:37:31.629 --> 00:37:34.379
on, right? It's unlucky that you're in a bad

609
00:37:34.379 --> 00:37:37.989
situation, but you reproduce fine, and you don't realize

610
00:37:37.989 --> 00:37:40.959
you're in a bad situation. So what that means

611
00:37:40.959 --> 00:37:44.949
is that harsh environments, these really bad low quality

612
00:37:45.199 --> 00:37:49.770
territories or low quality mates. ARE going to result

613
00:37:49.770 --> 00:37:53.300
in attachment rarely being expressed in the first place,

614
00:37:53.689 --> 00:37:58.159
and therefore rarely kind of leading to this this

615
00:37:58.159 --> 00:38:03.520
um Uh, maladaptive, keeping you in a bad situation.

616
00:38:04.419 --> 00:38:09.010
Mhm. OK, so I, I want to ask you

617
00:38:09.010 --> 00:38:13.729
about one last topic. Then you mentioned divorce. How

618
00:38:13.729 --> 00:38:18.800
has divorced, divorce evolved and which factors play a

619
00:38:18.800 --> 00:38:20.090
role in it? Yeah,

620
00:38:20.250 --> 00:38:23.689
so divorce clearly related to attachment based on what

621
00:38:23.689 --> 00:38:25.889
we've been talking about, right? Just the idea that

622
00:38:26.729 --> 00:38:29.189
Why does it evolve that even though you have?

623
00:38:30.159 --> 00:38:34.979
Uh, MONOGAMOUS pairs, they sometimes split up. This is

624
00:38:34.989 --> 00:38:40.500
likely to have evolved because It can allow individuals

625
00:38:40.500 --> 00:38:43.879
to leave those bad situations they might find themselves

626
00:38:43.879 --> 00:38:47.969
in, those low quality needs, low quality territories, and

627
00:38:47.969 --> 00:38:53.139
provide them with an opportunity to trade up. So

628
00:38:53.139 --> 00:38:56.929
if you know, you're in this situation where you

629
00:38:56.929 --> 00:39:00.610
have a nest failure, that's providing you with some

630
00:39:00.610 --> 00:39:04.770
imperfect information that maybe your mate is of low

631
00:39:04.770 --> 00:39:08.090
quality or your territory is of low quality, divorce

632
00:39:08.090 --> 00:39:10.879
gives you an opportunity to act on that information

633
00:39:11.290 --> 00:39:14.199
and look at what other types of opportunities are

634
00:39:14.199 --> 00:39:17.860
out there, potentially allowing you to find a higher

635
00:39:17.860 --> 00:39:24.189
quality mate or a higher quality territory. Um, THERE'S

636
00:39:24.189 --> 00:39:26.629
again kind of three factors that I would think

637
00:39:26.629 --> 00:39:30.590
of as being really important that shape the evolution

638
00:39:30.590 --> 00:39:33.510
of divorce. Uh, SO, and, and again, I'll kind

639
00:39:33.510 --> 00:39:36.590
of say it in the way that, uh, which

640
00:39:36.590 --> 00:39:39.510
factors favor the evolution of high divorce propensities. So

641
00:39:39.510 --> 00:39:42.159
being really quick to leave a partner given nest

642
00:39:42.159 --> 00:39:43.870
failure, but of course the flip side is just

643
00:39:43.870 --> 00:39:47.149
gonna favor low divorce propensities so this high mate

644
00:39:47.149 --> 00:39:50.149
fidelity and these really strong monogamous pairs that stay

645
00:39:50.149 --> 00:39:53.219
together. No, so the first thing that's going to

646
00:39:53.219 --> 00:39:57.540
favor the evolution of high divorce propensities is uh

647
00:39:57.540 --> 00:40:02.219
a large amount of environmental heterogeneity. So when you

648
00:40:02.219 --> 00:40:06.620
have both a strong mixture of high quality and

649
00:40:06.620 --> 00:40:10.659
low quality reproductive opportunities, this is going to favor.

650
00:40:11.300 --> 00:40:15.979
High divorce propensities, and when the difference between how

651
00:40:15.979 --> 00:40:19.290
good a good quality territory is and how bad

652
00:40:19.500 --> 00:40:23.139
a low quality territory is, that's also going to

653
00:40:23.139 --> 00:40:26.500
favor the evolution of high divorce propensities. And basically

654
00:40:26.500 --> 00:40:29.459
the reason for this, the intuition behind this is

655
00:40:29.459 --> 00:40:34.889
that high environmental heterogeneity. Is going to both make

656
00:40:34.889 --> 00:40:39.770
it easier for some correlation to form between individuals

657
00:40:39.770 --> 00:40:43.510
that divorce a lot and high quality territories. And

658
00:40:43.510 --> 00:40:45.870
it's also going to mean that that correlation that

659
00:40:45.870 --> 00:40:48.669
forms is going to have a bigger effect in

660
00:40:48.669 --> 00:40:51.949
terms of how many offspring are produced, because the

661
00:40:51.949 --> 00:40:53.989
good quality territories are so much better than the

662
00:40:53.989 --> 00:40:57.790
poor quality territories. The second factor that's going to

663
00:40:57.790 --> 00:41:03.270
favor the evolution of divorce is basically how important

664
00:41:03.270 --> 00:41:06.669
it is to know your partner. So there's evidence

665
00:41:06.669 --> 00:41:09.229
in a lot of birds, and I, I suspect

666
00:41:09.229 --> 00:41:12.969
it makes intuitive sense to people with kids that

667
00:41:13.270 --> 00:41:18.669
uh having the same partner for longer is beneficial

668
00:41:18.669 --> 00:41:24.419
for coordinating care for offspring. So, uh, a pair

669
00:41:24.419 --> 00:41:27.409
of birds that have been together for 5 years

670
00:41:27.939 --> 00:41:31.889
seem to be essentially better parents together than a

671
00:41:31.889 --> 00:41:36.909
pair in their first year. And If that benefit

672
00:41:36.909 --> 00:41:39.389
is big, then you probably don't want to get

673
00:41:39.389 --> 00:41:41.979
divorced very often, right? If that benefit is big,

674
00:41:42.070 --> 00:41:43.870
then every time you have to find a new

675
00:41:43.870 --> 00:41:46.699
partner, you're kind of resetting, and you need to

676
00:41:46.989 --> 00:41:51.830
re-establish how to coordinate offspring care together. So when

677
00:41:51.830 --> 00:41:54.669
that benefit is relatively small, when it doesn't matter

678
00:41:54.669 --> 00:41:58.790
how experienced you are with your partner, for how

679
00:41:58.790 --> 00:42:01.310
good you are at caring for offspring, that's going

680
00:42:01.310 --> 00:42:05.330
to favor the evolution of higher divorce propensities. And

681
00:42:05.330 --> 00:42:08.100
the last factor and kind of the, the hardest

682
00:42:08.100 --> 00:42:11.330
one I think to wrap your head around is,

683
00:42:11.820 --> 00:42:16.179
uh, how, what is the survival rate, the adult

684
00:42:16.179 --> 00:42:21.699
survival rate. So intermediate survival rates are going to

685
00:42:21.699 --> 00:42:25.310
favor the evolution of the highest divorce propensities. And

686
00:42:25.310 --> 00:42:28.030
this is coming from a trade-off of two different

687
00:42:28.030 --> 00:42:34.270
effects. High survival is going to be good for

688
00:42:34.600 --> 00:42:39.050
uh a lot of divorce. Because it's, it's putting

689
00:42:39.050 --> 00:42:42.340
individuals in control of their situation. The exact same

690
00:42:42.340 --> 00:42:44.989
thing we talked about with attachment. If survival rates

691
00:42:44.989 --> 00:42:48.300
are high, then it's the individuals themselves that are

692
00:42:48.300 --> 00:42:50.659
deciding, am I staying with this partner or am

693
00:42:50.659 --> 00:42:54.669
I leaving this partner. It allows for the trait

694
00:42:54.669 --> 00:42:57.669
that we're talking about divorce, to actually be expressed

695
00:42:57.669 --> 00:43:01.020
rather than to have high adult mortality splitting up

696
00:43:01.020 --> 00:43:03.540
pairs and forcing you to find a new pair

697
00:43:03.540 --> 00:43:06.939
regardless of what you want. This is why high

698
00:43:06.939 --> 00:43:10.899
survival is kind of good for high divorce propensities.

699
00:43:11.669 --> 00:43:14.270
Um, BUT there's a reason that low survival is

700
00:43:14.270 --> 00:43:18.820
good as well, which is that you need. To

701
00:43:18.820 --> 00:43:22.139
have something to trade up into, right? If the

702
00:43:22.139 --> 00:43:25.850
only opportunities that are available that are left available

703
00:43:26.219 --> 00:43:30.100
are low quality. If those only if you divorce

704
00:43:30.100 --> 00:43:31.989
and all you have to choose from are low

705
00:43:31.989 --> 00:43:36.469
quality mates. And low quality territories, then you probably

706
00:43:36.469 --> 00:43:41.030
don't want to get divorced. And mortality, the death

707
00:43:41.030 --> 00:43:44.149
of adults, low survival rates are going to free

708
00:43:44.149 --> 00:43:48.110
up good territories, right? Because those are kind of

709
00:43:48.110 --> 00:43:52.379
blind to whether that territory is of high quality

710
00:43:52.379 --> 00:43:55.189
or of low quality, or if that mate, especially

711
00:43:55.189 --> 00:43:56.790
if that mate is of high quality of low

712
00:43:56.790 --> 00:43:59.909
quality, that that might have no influence over whether

713
00:43:59.909 --> 00:44:04.389
or not you survive. So it's in those cases

714
00:44:04.389 --> 00:44:08.969
with low survival rates that Those good reproductive opportunities

715
00:44:08.969 --> 00:44:11.489
are getting freed up, and when you divorce, you

716
00:44:11.489 --> 00:44:15.540
actually have an opportunity to find something better. So

717
00:44:15.540 --> 00:44:18.179
because of those two conflicting effects, that reason that

718
00:44:18.179 --> 00:44:22.139
high survival is good um for divorce propensities and

719
00:44:22.139 --> 00:44:24.659
that low survival is good for divorce propensities, you

720
00:44:24.659 --> 00:44:27.540
get this sort of hump shape where it's an

721
00:44:27.540 --> 00:44:30.889
intermediate survival rates that you actually get the highest

722
00:44:30.889 --> 00:44:34.000
divorce propensities due to the balancing of those two

723
00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:35.020
opposing effects.

724
00:44:37.250 --> 00:44:40.370
OK, so would you like to tell us what

725
00:44:40.370 --> 00:44:43.199
you're going to be working on in the near

726
00:44:43.199 --> 00:44:46.209
future? Do you, do you already have any ideas

727
00:44:46.209 --> 00:44:46.790
or?

728
00:44:47.250 --> 00:44:49.729
Yeah, so I, I guess sort of the, the

729
00:44:49.729 --> 00:44:52.639
place that I'm planning on moving and have a,

730
00:44:52.649 --> 00:44:55.530
a proposal funded to work on in the next

731
00:44:55.530 --> 00:45:00.129
few years is uh something fairly different from the

732
00:45:00.129 --> 00:45:02.449
stuff that we've been talking about still in the

733
00:45:02.449 --> 00:45:07.110
same general realm, but Instead looking at uh the

734
00:45:07.110 --> 00:45:10.959
role of, of cooperative behavior and group living and

735
00:45:10.959 --> 00:45:14.550
understanding essentially how social networks, so how the set

736
00:45:14.550 --> 00:45:17.110
of connections that you make with your group mates

737
00:45:17.110 --> 00:45:21.659
and the the individual differentiation in those connections has

738
00:45:22.060 --> 00:45:26.330
effects on Kind of population level processes like patterns

739
00:45:26.330 --> 00:45:30.610
of population growth, uh, or evolutionary trajectories that are

740
00:45:30.610 --> 00:45:33.979
occurring in these populations that are socially structured. Uh,

741
00:45:34.250 --> 00:45:36.919
SO, you know, so much work on social networks

742
00:45:37.250 --> 00:45:39.929
just focuses on a single social group and kind

743
00:45:39.929 --> 00:45:42.610
of treats that one network and that one social

744
00:45:42.610 --> 00:45:45.129
group is the whole universe. Um, AND I think

745
00:45:45.129 --> 00:45:48.800
there's a lot of really exciting. Uh, EXCITING examples

746
00:45:48.800 --> 00:45:51.399
and exciting opportunities to extend that to kind of

747
00:45:51.399 --> 00:45:54.189
a higher level view where, you know, you have

748
00:45:54.189 --> 00:45:57.449
populations, uh, like you'd see many primates where you

749
00:45:57.449 --> 00:45:59.310
can kind of think of each group as having

750
00:45:59.310 --> 00:46:02.800
their own social network, and those different groups are

751
00:46:03.199 --> 00:46:05.780
not going to interact prosocially but they might interact

752
00:46:05.780 --> 00:46:12.149
competitively and understanding how The network structure interacts with

753
00:46:12.439 --> 00:46:15.639
those between group interactions and shapes those population level

754
00:46:15.639 --> 00:46:19.120
processes, I think is a really exciting frontier for

755
00:46:19.120 --> 00:46:23.199
understanding social behavior, uh exciting frontier for behavioral ecology,

756
00:46:23.239 --> 00:46:25.760
and something I'm kind of planning on focusing on

757
00:46:25.760 --> 00:46:27.590
for the next uh few years.

758
00:46:29.199 --> 00:46:32.750
Great, so are there any places on the internet

759
00:46:32.750 --> 00:46:35.050
where people can follow your work?

760
00:46:36.030 --> 00:46:43.060
Yeah, so, um, I have a, um, Twitter account

761
00:46:43.060 --> 00:46:46.989
and a blue sky account, um, at Lurch Eco

762
00:46:46.989 --> 00:46:52.429
Evo, um, and also, um, you know, I, I

763
00:46:52.429 --> 00:46:54.270
think if you Google me, you can come across

764
00:46:54.270 --> 00:46:57.030
a website, my website, and, and that will also

765
00:46:57.030 --> 00:47:00.070
allow you to, to keep up on, on papers

766
00:47:00.070 --> 00:47:01.989
and other news as it comes out.

767
00:47:03.010 --> 00:47:05.850
