00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:03.250
Hello, everyone. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:06.179
Center. I'm your host, as always, Ricardo Lopes and

3
00:00:06.179 --> 00:00:09.380
the MG by Doctor Paul Penn. He's senior lecturer

4
00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:11.699
in the School of Psychology at the University of

5
00:00:11.699 --> 00:00:16.250
East London. His interests revolve around cognitive psychology and

6
00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:19.530
understanding how we can best use psychological knowledge to

7
00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:23.629
improve the way people learn, communicate, and collaborate. And

8
00:00:23.629 --> 00:00:26.510
today we're focusing on his book, The Psychology of

9
00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:30.899
Effective Studying, How to Succeed in your Degree. So,

10
00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:33.259
Doctor Pen, welcome to the show. It's a pleasure

11
00:00:33.259 --> 00:00:33.830
to have you on.

12
00:00:34.669 --> 00:00:36.490
Thank you for having me, really great, great to

13
00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:36.889
be here.

14
00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:41.639
So perhaps just to introduce the book here, could

15
00:00:41.639 --> 00:00:44.560
you start by telling us what led you to

16
00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:47.209
writing this book? I mean, and what are perhaps

17
00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:49.669
the main goals you had in mind with it?

18
00:00:50.439 --> 00:00:53.360
Yeah, so the, the main reason for writing the

19
00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:56.799
book really was purely because um as a lecturer

20
00:00:56.799 --> 00:00:58.520
I'd seen a lot of and heard a lot

21
00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:02.069
of students expressing a lot of dissatisfaction with studying.

22
00:01:02.409 --> 00:01:04.440
You know, it's common to hear things like, you

23
00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:07.129
know, I love university, but the studying sucks, you

24
00:01:07.129 --> 00:01:08.569
know, and, and part of you as a lecturer

25
00:01:08.569 --> 00:01:10.050
hears that and goes, well, that's kind of why

26
00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:13.209
we're here, to be honest with you. Um, SO

27
00:01:13.449 --> 00:01:15.290
I wondered why that was the case, and then

28
00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:17.449
I started just, you know, um, you know, having

29
00:01:17.449 --> 00:01:19.930
some interviews with students and, and, and looking at

30
00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:23.050
the research, and what I quickly found is that.

31
00:01:23.139 --> 00:01:26.010
A lot of students weren't using approaches to studying

32
00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:30.330
that were informed by psychological research. So they were

33
00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:32.790
using methods of studying that were familiar to them,

34
00:01:33.059 --> 00:01:35.760
um, that felt right for them. But when you

35
00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:38.489
actually compared that with what psychology had to say

36
00:01:38.489 --> 00:01:40.919
on what methods of studying work and what don't,

37
00:01:41.169 --> 00:01:45.139
they were often using very ineffective practice. Um, SO,

38
00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:47.319
you know, and that's a problem across the board,

39
00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:49.559
you know, whether you study of organic chemistry or,

40
00:01:49.669 --> 00:01:52.120
or, or physics, you know, it's not good if

41
00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:54.760
you study and practice aren't informed by what works

42
00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:57.919
and what doesn't. But it's particularly bad for students

43
00:01:57.919 --> 00:02:00.199
of psychology, um, you know, because they're the ones

44
00:02:00.199 --> 00:02:02.919
that are studying, uh, things like attention and memory

45
00:02:02.919 --> 00:02:05.480
and, and so on. So if they're really not

46
00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:07.400
getting it right, um, it, it's a real problem.

47
00:02:07.519 --> 00:02:09.919
So I thought, really what I need to do

48
00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:12.559
is try and produce a book that kind of

49
00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:15.740
can be a uh a con a reasonably concise

50
00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:20.339
and and hopefully. Fairly engaging guide to how psychology

51
00:02:20.339 --> 00:02:24.289
can inform your study practices and ensure that you

52
00:02:24.289 --> 00:02:26.990
study more effectively so that you could find studying

53
00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:29.000
a bit more engaging and and get more out

54
00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.789
of your efforts. Basically, I wanted to help people

55
00:02:31.789 --> 00:02:34.190
see things or see studying as something that could

56
00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:37.300
be um enjoyed rather than just endured.

57
00:02:38.199 --> 00:02:42.100
And what does it mean to study effectively?

58
00:02:42.389 --> 00:02:44.710
Mm. Well, I think when when I talk about

59
00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:47.789
effective studying, what I'm actually talking about is the

60
00:02:47.789 --> 00:02:51.740
use of methods that are supported by psychological research.

61
00:02:52.119 --> 00:02:55.229
OK? So what, what I really want there is

62
00:02:55.229 --> 00:02:57.830
for people to be using approaches to studying that

63
00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:02.100
are actually informed by psychology and not informed by,

64
00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:04.550
you know, intuition. Because a lot of times when

65
00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:06.725
people study, they, they, you know. If they reflect

66
00:03:06.725 --> 00:03:09.324
on their study habits at all, they tend to

67
00:03:09.324 --> 00:03:13.604
use what they think works, um, intuitively. And the

68
00:03:13.604 --> 00:03:15.764
problem with our intuition when it comes to what

69
00:03:15.764 --> 00:03:18.835
works and what doesn't, is it's often wrong. And

70
00:03:18.835 --> 00:03:21.205
in the first chapter of the book, that's really

71
00:03:21.205 --> 00:03:24.164
what it's about. It's me trying to dispel certain,

72
00:03:24.244 --> 00:03:28.675
um, if you like, fallacies and, and cognitive biases

73
00:03:28.675 --> 00:03:32.729
and, and. And misconceptions people have about studying, um,

74
00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:34.600
you know, a, a, a good one is that

75
00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:38.720
studying, you know, should be relatively easy, um, and

76
00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:41.119
not especially challenging, and, and if you're really starting

77
00:03:41.119 --> 00:03:44.600
to struggle, then something's going wrong. When in point

78
00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:47.080
of fact, there's, there's a lot of research that

79
00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:50.279
suggests that certain elements of difficulty when you're studying

80
00:03:50.279 --> 00:03:53.440
are actually a very constructive thing. Um, TO overcome,

81
00:03:53.479 --> 00:03:55.350
it's, it's a bit like going to the gym,

82
00:03:55.479 --> 00:03:56.679
you know, if you try and lift a weight

83
00:03:56.679 --> 00:03:58.839
the first time, you might not quite be able

84
00:03:58.839 --> 00:04:01.479
to manage it. Um, BUT you know, you wouldn't

85
00:04:01.479 --> 00:04:03.080
necessarily necessarily regard that as a failure because part

86
00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:04.990
of you knows that what's gonna happen is you're,

87
00:04:05.179 --> 00:04:06.839
you're gonna go home and be a bit sore

88
00:04:06.839 --> 00:04:08.889
for a while and your muscle is gonna rebuild

89
00:04:09.039 --> 00:04:11.229
a little bit stronger and you'll be that more,

90
00:04:11.399 --> 00:04:13.000
much closer to be able to lift the weight

91
00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.770
in the future. And your memory actually works in

92
00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:17.790
a in a similar way. um, AND if you're

93
00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:21.029
not struggling and you're not having some retrieval failures,

94
00:04:21.149 --> 00:04:23.390
then you're probably not progressing. Even though it doesn't

95
00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:25.750
feel very good, actually, you know, not being able

96
00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:27.230
to retrieve things as well as being able to

97
00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:30.709
retrieve things is helpful for your progress. Uh, AND

98
00:04:30.709 --> 00:04:32.709
that's quite a difficult thing, I think, for students

99
00:04:32.709 --> 00:04:34.869
to get their head around initially. They just assume

100
00:04:34.869 --> 00:04:36.709
that if it's not, they haven't got it straight

101
00:04:36.709 --> 00:04:38.910
away, then that means they're not going about it

102
00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:41.679
the right way. So when I talk about effective

103
00:04:41.679 --> 00:04:43.880
studying, what I mean is methods of studying that

104
00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:47.200
are informed by the research and not just by

105
00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:47.910
intuition.

106
00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:52.170
So one of the aspects of our psychology that

107
00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:55.049
you focus on in the initial parts of the

108
00:04:55.049 --> 00:04:57.890
book and that seems to be very important in

109
00:04:57.890 --> 00:05:03.209
the context of studying is metacognition. What is metacognition

110
00:05:03.209 --> 00:05:07.170
about? Um, WELL, metacognition, it's in its broadest sense,

111
00:05:07.209 --> 00:05:10.250
it's really just sort of thinking about thinking, which

112
00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:13.130
sounds like a really esoteric or academic in the

113
00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:16.660
worst possible way, uh, thing to say. But really

114
00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:19.019
when you think about it, it's incredibly important because

115
00:05:19.019 --> 00:05:21.739
you are, your, your attempts to study and your

116
00:05:21.739 --> 00:05:24.660
efforts to study are always going to be linked

117
00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:26.940
to your perception of what you know and what

118
00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:30.290
you don't know. So if you're fairly confident in

119
00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:32.420
your, uh, you know, uh, in your knowledge about

120
00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:34.440
a particular topic, there's a good chance you're not

121
00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:36.779
gonna continue to hit the books and um and

122
00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:39.640
and and study that topic. But on the other

123
00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:41.640
hand, if you're not confident in your knowledge about

124
00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:44.200
that subject, there's a good chance you'll be motivated

125
00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:46.880
to hit the books, as it were. Um, THAT'S

126
00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:49.040
all well and good when it goes right, but

127
00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:52.279
the problem with metacognition is often our perception of

128
00:05:52.279 --> 00:05:53.760
what we know and what we don't know and

129
00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:55.880
our perception of how good we are at something,

130
00:05:55.929 --> 00:05:59.079
so our level of competence, often is a little

131
00:05:59.079 --> 00:06:02.359
bit divorced um from the, the reality of the

132
00:06:02.359 --> 00:06:05.619
matter, the objective reality. Um, AND that can be

133
00:06:05.619 --> 00:06:08.890
a problem, particularly when you're starting out, um, on

134
00:06:08.890 --> 00:06:11.010
your journey to, you know, studying a new topic,

135
00:06:11.089 --> 00:06:14.619
for example, um, because what can tend to happen

136
00:06:14.619 --> 00:06:16.450
is when you know a little bit about the

137
00:06:16.450 --> 00:06:18.929
topic, you can get an inflated idea about your

138
00:06:18.929 --> 00:06:21.290
knowledge. Uh, WHEREAS when you know a lot about

139
00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:23.730
the topic, what tends to happen is you start

140
00:06:23.730 --> 00:06:26.329
to get almost like an imposter syndrome. Um, THE

141
00:06:26.329 --> 00:06:28.089
more you learn about something, the more you realize

142
00:06:28.089 --> 00:06:30.170
you don't know, um, you know, which is why

143
00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:32.119
they say a little learning is a dangerous thing.

144
00:06:32.529 --> 00:06:34.570
Um, SOMETIMES, you know, it's, it's when you know

145
00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:37.609
a little bit that you're, you're you're the biggest

146
00:06:37.609 --> 00:06:39.950
risk of kind of having an inflated perception of

147
00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:41.170
actually how much you know.

148
00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:47.109
It is the the Kruger effect and the the

149
00:06:47.109 --> 00:06:49.750
Kruger effect, I mean, in simple terms is just

150
00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:53.630
basically the idea that people who are the least

151
00:06:53.630 --> 00:06:58.470
knowledgeable would tend to be the most overconfident in

152
00:06:58.470 --> 00:07:00.950
terms of what they know about the particular subject.

153
00:07:01.070 --> 00:07:05.149
But is that phenomenon really a thing? Does it

154
00:07:05.149 --> 00:07:06.869
really exist or not?

155
00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:09.959
Yeah, I, I, I think there's, there's not much,

156
00:07:10.190 --> 00:07:11.910
you know, I think debate in the research about

157
00:07:11.910 --> 00:07:14.470
whether it exists. So, so the Dunny Kruger effect,

158
00:07:14.510 --> 00:07:16.260
I think, as you're alluding to here really, is

159
00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:18.709
that you are at the most risk of having

160
00:07:18.709 --> 00:07:22.019
an inflated perception of how much you know, um,

161
00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:23.910
when, when you know the least, basically, when you

162
00:07:23.910 --> 00:07:25.510
just know a little bit. And the same for

163
00:07:25.510 --> 00:07:27.350
perception of how skilled you are as well. You're,

164
00:07:27.510 --> 00:07:29.549
you're at the greatest danger of thinking you're more

165
00:07:29.549 --> 00:07:32.070
skilled than you actually are when you are, you

166
00:07:32.070 --> 00:07:35.350
know, the least skilled, as it were. Um, SO.

167
00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:37.959
I don't think there's too much debate about whether

168
00:07:37.959 --> 00:07:40.410
it actually exists. I think there's, there's pretty much

169
00:07:40.410 --> 00:07:43.070
universal agreement about there does seem to be a,

170
00:07:43.079 --> 00:07:46.130
a gap between perceived ability or perceived knowledge and

171
00:07:46.130 --> 00:07:48.700
actual ability and actual knowledge, and that tends to

172
00:07:48.700 --> 00:07:50.769
be the biggest when you're, you know, on the

173
00:07:50.769 --> 00:07:53.329
start of your learning or skill acquisition journey. I

174
00:07:53.329 --> 00:07:55.250
think what the debate tends to be about is

175
00:07:55.250 --> 00:07:57.649
what causes it. Uh, AND there are, there are

176
00:07:57.649 --> 00:07:59.839
those of us that probably believe that it is,

177
00:07:59.959 --> 00:08:03.339
it's a metacognitive failing. So we would probably argue

178
00:08:03.339 --> 00:08:05.700
that the reason that you are most vulnerable to

179
00:08:05.700 --> 00:08:07.700
having an inflated perception of how good you are

180
00:08:07.700 --> 00:08:09.619
or how knowledgeable you are when you know a

181
00:08:09.619 --> 00:08:12.980
little bit, is because you, you don't really have

182
00:08:12.980 --> 00:08:15.579
the skills at that point to evaluate your level

183
00:08:15.579 --> 00:08:17.940
of knowledge. It's the same skills or that you

184
00:08:17.940 --> 00:08:20.010
need to be good at something, for example, that

185
00:08:20.010 --> 00:08:23.179
you need to evaluate how good you are. So,

186
00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:25.269
you know. WHEN you're, when you're new to something,

187
00:08:25.350 --> 00:08:27.679
you just, you know, the ignorance is a double-edged

188
00:08:27.679 --> 00:08:29.510
sword. You're not very good at something, but you

189
00:08:29.510 --> 00:08:31.510
lack the, the knowledge to know you're not very

190
00:08:31.510 --> 00:08:33.710
good at it. Um, WHEREAS as you get more

191
00:08:33.710 --> 00:08:37.099
proficient, um, what tends to happen is your awareness

192
00:08:37.099 --> 00:08:39.909
of just how little you know tends to expand.

193
00:08:40.070 --> 00:08:43.308
So what is not known to you expands on

194
00:08:43.308 --> 00:08:45.950
the horizon much more rapidly than what. Is known.

195
00:08:46.289 --> 00:08:48.080
Uh, BUT that takes a little bit of engagement

196
00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:50.690
with the topic or engagement with the skill acquisition

197
00:08:50.690 --> 00:08:52.840
to kind of figure out. And then when you

198
00:08:52.840 --> 00:08:54.559
get to the other end of the spectrum, what

199
00:08:54.559 --> 00:08:56.989
tends to happen is, as you become an expert,

200
00:08:57.200 --> 00:09:00.400
your knowledge becomes so detailed and so nuanced, and

201
00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:03.280
your awareness of what you don't yet know, uh,

202
00:09:03.320 --> 00:09:05.599
expands at such a rate that you, you almost

203
00:09:05.599 --> 00:09:07.780
feel like you know nothing. So it's, it's a

204
00:09:07.780 --> 00:09:10.590
really strange thing that sometimes the more knowledgeable you

205
00:09:10.590 --> 00:09:13.500
become, the the less you perceive the progress that

206
00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:16.619
you've made, because the, the double-edged sword is that

207
00:09:16.619 --> 00:09:19.400
as you become more knowledgeable, you also become more

208
00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:21.710
aware about the things that you don't know. So

209
00:09:21.710 --> 00:09:24.760
that's one explanation, it's kind of a metacognitive quirk.

210
00:09:25.020 --> 00:09:26.859
Um, AND one of the other explanations that's been

211
00:09:26.859 --> 00:09:29.190
put forward, um, and has led to some people

212
00:09:29.190 --> 00:09:31.609
being, I think, quite dismissive of the Dunning-Kruger effect

213
00:09:31.609 --> 00:09:34.219
is that it's a al artifact of some kind

214
00:09:34.219 --> 00:09:36.989
like a regression to the mean effect. Um, BUT

215
00:09:36.989 --> 00:09:39.099
I, I'm, I'm not sure the, the, the research

216
00:09:39.099 --> 00:09:41.539
is, is ready to make a definitive comment on,

217
00:09:41.590 --> 00:09:44.159
on, on that yet. My feeling is it's, it's,

218
00:09:44.190 --> 00:09:46.549
it, I don't, I don't, not entirely convinced by

219
00:09:46.549 --> 00:09:49.789
it being a statistical artifact. Um, THE, the, the

220
00:09:49.789 --> 00:09:52.789
idea of it being, um, the fact that you're,

221
00:09:52.869 --> 00:09:54.700
you're not knowledgeable enough to know what. You don't

222
00:09:54.700 --> 00:09:57.380
yet know seems a much more plausible explanation to

223
00:09:57.380 --> 00:09:59.369
me, but I think the jury is still out,

224
00:09:59.500 --> 00:10:02.059
but I think whichever side you tend to go

225
00:10:02.059 --> 00:10:05.289
on, the fact that you are the most at

226
00:10:05.289 --> 00:10:08.409
risk of er an inflated perception of your knowledge

227
00:10:08.409 --> 00:10:10.739
when you are the least knowledgeable is a fairly

228
00:10:10.739 --> 00:10:12.489
uncontentious thing to say, really.

229
00:10:13.669 --> 00:10:17.020
And when it comes to studying, does the ability

230
00:10:17.020 --> 00:10:21.450
to remember something equate uh understanding it, I mean,

231
00:10:21.500 --> 00:10:24.099
is it the same as understanding it or not?

232
00:10:25.229 --> 00:10:28.099
Um, NO, I, I think quite often people make

233
00:10:28.099 --> 00:10:31.450
the mistake of, uh, of kind of conflating knowledge

234
00:10:31.450 --> 00:10:35.169
and understanding, or at least recall and understanding. Um,

235
00:10:35.380 --> 00:10:37.820
SO one of the, um, one of the things

236
00:10:37.820 --> 00:10:40.940
that I mention in the book is, um, a

237
00:10:40.940 --> 00:10:43.099
study that looks at, well, how would you go

238
00:10:43.099 --> 00:10:47.609
about distinguishing understanding. FROM, um, recall. So one of

239
00:10:47.609 --> 00:10:50.090
the ways you could do that, for example, um,

240
00:10:50.140 --> 00:10:53.150
is to look at contradictions and whether people spot

241
00:10:53.150 --> 00:10:56.049
contradictions, because to spot a contradiction, you, you have

242
00:10:56.049 --> 00:10:58.690
to know something about the topic, to know that

243
00:10:58.690 --> 00:11:01.650
two things can't logically, um, you know, exist at

244
00:11:01.650 --> 00:11:03.169
the same time. You have to have some degree

245
00:11:03.169 --> 00:11:06.929
of understanding. Um, SO this study was, was looking

246
00:11:06.929 --> 00:11:09.979
at undergraduates and, uh, it was looking at their

247
00:11:09.979 --> 00:11:13.960
ability to recall the passage of text. And what

248
00:11:13.960 --> 00:11:15.200
they did at one point is they, they got

249
00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:17.200
the students to try and read this passage of

250
00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:19.200
text. And then at the end of it, they,

251
00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:21.520
um, they said to them, OK, um, gave you

252
00:11:21.520 --> 00:11:22.840
a, gave you a, we'll give you a test

253
00:11:22.840 --> 00:11:25.119
now on the contents of this passage. But we'll

254
00:11:25.119 --> 00:11:29.030
also look at whether, um, you can spot contradictions

255
00:11:29.030 --> 00:11:31.320
in the text or not. And the students were

256
00:11:31.320 --> 00:11:33.719
actually warned that the texts would contain or might

257
00:11:33.719 --> 00:11:35.760
contain contradictions right from the start, and as it

258
00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:38.010
happened, the contradictions were always in the same place.

259
00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:39.359
I think it was towards the end of the

260
00:11:39.359 --> 00:11:42.880
passage, the last sentence or penultimate sentence. Um, SO

261
00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:44.799
what you'd hope there is, is if students, you

262
00:11:44.799 --> 00:11:46.760
know, did the test and could recall parts of

263
00:11:46.760 --> 00:11:50.359
the passage, and they claim to understand it, what

264
00:11:50.359 --> 00:11:52.280
you'd also hope is that they would spot the

265
00:11:52.280 --> 00:11:56.000
contradictions. Um, WHAT you'd hope wouldn't happen is they

266
00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:57.880
would claim to understand it and then miss the

267
00:11:57.880 --> 00:12:00.640
contradictions cos that then implies they didn't. Uh, AND

268
00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:02.679
what they found is students were often claiming about

269
00:12:02.679 --> 00:12:05.119
50% of the cases, I think. Students were often

270
00:12:05.119 --> 00:12:07.640
claiming that they understood a passage of text, but

271
00:12:07.640 --> 00:12:10.400
were then completely oblivious to the contradictions it claimed.

272
00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.359
So the, the kind of irritating thing in some

273
00:12:13.359 --> 00:12:16.349
ways about um the difference between I suppose knowledge

274
00:12:16.349 --> 00:12:18.960
and understanding or the ability to recall something and

275
00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:21.280
understand it, is it it's possible to be able

276
00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:25.090
to recall information without understanding it. Um, BUT you

277
00:12:25.090 --> 00:12:27.169
know, it's, it's not essential, you don't have to

278
00:12:27.169 --> 00:12:29.000
understand that to be able to recall it. But

279
00:12:29.369 --> 00:12:32.169
once you do understand something, that is a massive

280
00:12:32.169 --> 00:12:34.210
aid to your memory. And indeed, a lot of

281
00:12:34.210 --> 00:12:36.690
the methods of studying that we advocate tend to

282
00:12:36.690 --> 00:12:40.299
promote things like self explanation. So rather than just

283
00:12:40.299 --> 00:12:43.969
trying to um reproduce an explanation of something, you

284
00:12:43.969 --> 00:12:46.770
have to explain it in your own words. So

285
00:12:46.770 --> 00:12:50.049
actually that process of trying to disassemble something and

286
00:12:50.049 --> 00:12:52.969
put it back together again. And come to an

287
00:12:52.969 --> 00:12:55.210
understanding of how it works and explaining it in

288
00:12:55.210 --> 00:12:57.460
your own words is a really powerful aid to

289
00:12:57.460 --> 00:12:59.530
memory, but unfortunately it doesn't work the other way

290
00:12:59.530 --> 00:13:01.500
round, just cos you can recall something doesn't mean

291
00:13:01.500 --> 00:13:03.619
necessarily that you understand it. And I think that's

292
00:13:03.619 --> 00:13:06.510
something that students often, uh, tend to get wrong.

293
00:13:06.739 --> 00:13:08.140
And, and it might be one of the reasons

294
00:13:08.140 --> 00:13:09.979
why that one of the things that students often

295
00:13:09.979 --> 00:13:12.849
struggle with is things like critical evaluation as well,

296
00:13:13.219 --> 00:13:15.169
because they, they, they've recalled a piece of information,

297
00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:17.659
so the assumption is, well, I must have some

298
00:13:18.059 --> 00:13:21.219
critical faculty with this information or understanding of this

299
00:13:21.219 --> 00:13:23.419
information when in point of fact, they they, they

300
00:13:23.419 --> 00:13:24.090
don't really.

301
00:13:25.320 --> 00:13:29.630
Is self-testing an effective study strategy?

302
00:13:30.799 --> 00:13:33.520
Uh, YEAH, it, it, it's a very, um, effective

303
00:13:33.520 --> 00:13:36.309
study strategy. It's probably the, one of the few

304
00:13:36.309 --> 00:13:39.830
things in psychology that is, is very uncontentious. If

305
00:13:39.830 --> 00:13:41.799
you, if you talk about things like the testing

306
00:13:41.799 --> 00:13:44.440
effect, which is, which is what the, the method

307
00:13:44.440 --> 00:13:47.080
of um self testing is based on. So the

308
00:13:47.080 --> 00:13:49.440
testing effect simply says that um if you have

309
00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:52.854
a period of studying. Um, IT'S, it, if you,

310
00:13:52.955 --> 00:13:55.835
um, read a passage of text, for example, and

311
00:13:55.835 --> 00:13:58.625
then you test yourself repeatedly for a given period

312
00:13:58.625 --> 00:14:02.034
of time, your, your memory for that material will

313
00:14:02.034 --> 00:14:05.234
be superior than if you just reread that text

314
00:14:05.234 --> 00:14:08.684
over and over again. Um, AND it's, uh, initially,

315
00:14:08.755 --> 00:14:10.755
I think sometimes there's a bit of skepticism about

316
00:14:10.755 --> 00:14:12.275
that because people say, well, that's just learning to

317
00:14:12.275 --> 00:14:14.869
the test and things like that. But actually it

318
00:14:14.880 --> 00:14:17.369
it's not because the researchers looked at this and

319
00:14:17.369 --> 00:14:19.210
it doesn't matter whether the, the, you know, the

320
00:14:19.210 --> 00:14:21.320
questions you use to test yourself are the same

321
00:14:21.450 --> 00:14:24.640
that appear in a final test or different, um,

322
00:14:24.890 --> 00:14:27.030
sometimes they can assess a different application of the

323
00:14:27.030 --> 00:14:30.770
knowledge. Um, IT just seems that the process of

324
00:14:30.770 --> 00:14:33.450
trying to assess whether you can recall something is

325
00:14:33.450 --> 00:14:36.640
a very powerful metacognitive aid. Because what it does

326
00:14:36.640 --> 00:14:40.320
is it takes the guesswork out of um your

327
00:14:40.320 --> 00:14:42.000
perception of what you know and what you don't

328
00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.599
know. um BECAUSE sometimes you can get an illusory

329
00:14:44.599 --> 00:14:47.200
impression of what you know. So if you're rereading

330
00:14:47.200 --> 00:14:49.919
something over and over again, for example, what can

331
00:14:49.919 --> 00:14:53.190
happen there is the, the material will subjectively start

332
00:14:53.190 --> 00:14:55.789
to feel familiar to you. But the problem is

333
00:14:55.789 --> 00:14:59.059
with that is that you haven't taken into account

334
00:14:59.429 --> 00:15:02.770
that the conditions of learning, so you're learning with

335
00:15:02.770 --> 00:15:05.109
the source available to you all the time, are

336
00:15:05.109 --> 00:15:07.270
not going to match up with the conditions of

337
00:15:07.270 --> 00:15:10.390
recall, uh, where the source probably won't be available

338
00:15:10.390 --> 00:15:13.179
to you. Um, SO that impression you get of

339
00:15:13.179 --> 00:15:17.590
familiarity and rereading something repeatedly is illusory and will

340
00:15:17.590 --> 00:15:19.700
most likely evaporate as soon as you don't have

341
00:15:19.700 --> 00:15:21.890
the source in front of you. Now, the good

342
00:15:21.890 --> 00:15:23.900
thing about self-testing, as long as you're doing it,

343
00:15:23.940 --> 00:15:25.580
you know, not cheating, as it were, and looking

344
00:15:25.580 --> 00:15:27.500
at the source, is that it gives you a

345
00:15:27.500 --> 00:15:29.340
much more objective idea of what you know and

346
00:15:29.340 --> 00:15:31.659
what you don't know. And when you have a

347
00:15:31.659 --> 00:15:33.650
more objective and. Your idea of what you know

348
00:15:33.650 --> 00:15:35.989
and what you don't know, you can orientate your

349
00:15:35.989 --> 00:15:38.530
future studying, um, in a much more kind of

350
00:15:38.530 --> 00:15:41.489
precise and productive manner. So rather than then, you

351
00:15:41.489 --> 00:15:44.450
know, just rehearsing everything again, you're actually sort of

352
00:15:44.450 --> 00:15:47.289
focusing in on the material where, you know, you've

353
00:15:47.289 --> 00:15:50.250
had those retrieval failures. Uh, AND again, as we,

354
00:15:50.289 --> 00:15:52.840
we alluded to earlier, um, one of the, the,

355
00:15:52.849 --> 00:15:54.690
the things that makes self test. In work is

356
00:15:54.690 --> 00:15:57.559
the fact that retrieval failure, so, you know, not

357
00:15:57.559 --> 00:16:00.039
quite being able to remember something, despite the fact

358
00:16:00.039 --> 00:16:03.200
it doesn't feel very good subjectively, it's actually very

359
00:16:03.200 --> 00:16:05.669
useful for your memory. Um, YOU know, it is,

360
00:16:05.719 --> 00:16:08.359
it's, it's very much what you remember tends to

361
00:16:08.359 --> 00:16:11.119
be the, the effort that you put into processing

362
00:16:11.119 --> 00:16:14.080
that information, particularly if you start investing effort into

363
00:16:14.080 --> 00:16:17.510
thinking about that information. So, so self testing is,

364
00:16:17.520 --> 00:16:21.330
is, is incredibly um important um and it, it's

365
00:16:21.330 --> 00:16:23.690
probably the, the one piece of advice that I

366
00:16:23.690 --> 00:16:25.049
would, you know, if you could give them no

367
00:16:25.049 --> 00:16:26.559
other advice, this is what I would say to

368
00:16:26.559 --> 00:16:28.840
students. It's, it's not what you think you know,

369
00:16:29.109 --> 00:16:31.994
um, that matters. It's what you condemn. THAT you

370
00:16:31.994 --> 00:16:35.604
know. And you should view self testing, so I,

371
00:16:35.635 --> 00:16:37.494
I emphasize the word self testing here, so very

372
00:16:37.494 --> 00:16:41.474
low stakes self administered tests. You should view that

373
00:16:41.474 --> 00:16:44.794
as part of the process of learning, not just

374
00:16:44.794 --> 00:16:46.354
do something that you do at the end of

375
00:16:46.354 --> 00:16:46.755
learning.

376
00:16:48.190 --> 00:16:51.700
So let's now talk a little bit about procrastination,

377
00:16:51.849 --> 00:16:54.729
because that's something that students worry a lot about

378
00:16:54.729 --> 00:16:57.890
and even people at work and in other sorts

379
00:16:57.890 --> 00:17:02.609
of contexts. So how does procrastination work and why

380
00:17:02.609 --> 00:17:04.969
does it seem that we tend to fall into

381
00:17:04.969 --> 00:17:06.329
it so easily?

382
00:17:07.020 --> 00:17:08.969
Yeah, it does seem sometimes, doesn't it, that it's

383
00:17:08.969 --> 00:17:11.410
just something we just never learn from perpetually suffer

384
00:17:11.410 --> 00:17:14.608
with it. Um, PROCRASTINATION, I think it's been described

385
00:17:14.608 --> 00:17:19.050
as the kind of quintessential self-regulation failure. Um, AND

386
00:17:19.050 --> 00:17:20.930
the reason we fall for it easily and sometimes

387
00:17:20.930 --> 00:17:23.928
we repeatedly do it. Um, IT'S because we don't

388
00:17:23.928 --> 00:17:27.489
really necessarily understand what causes it. Not, not researchers.

389
00:17:27.588 --> 00:17:29.168
We're, we're starting to get to grips with it,

390
00:17:29.208 --> 00:17:31.889
but for the layperson, it's just something that's an

391
00:17:31.889 --> 00:17:34.848
incredible nuisance that's a scourge on their lives, and

392
00:17:34.848 --> 00:17:37.409
no matter how much they might, um, tell themselves

393
00:17:37.409 --> 00:17:39.688
off after the last bout of procrastination, they just

394
00:17:39.688 --> 00:17:42.180
can't seem to kick it, as it were. Um,

395
00:17:42.420 --> 00:17:44.859
SO I think making people aware of, of some

396
00:17:44.859 --> 00:17:47.099
of the drivers of procrastination is really important, and

397
00:17:47.099 --> 00:17:51.069
there are two aspects of cognition that are particularly

398
00:17:51.069 --> 00:17:54.170
important when it comes to thinking about, uh, procrastination.

399
00:17:54.619 --> 00:17:58.750
One is what we call hyperbolic discounting. And this

400
00:17:58.750 --> 00:18:01.750
just means that we tend to prefer doing things

401
00:18:01.750 --> 00:18:04.750
that will give us small rewards, but they'll they'll,

402
00:18:04.880 --> 00:18:07.430
they'll generate those rewards very quickly, so very soon

403
00:18:07.430 --> 00:18:10.920
in the near future, than we do, um, we

404
00:18:10.920 --> 00:18:13.880
prefer that to engaging with bigger things, more complicated

405
00:18:13.880 --> 00:18:16.479
tasks that will give us much bigger rewards, but

406
00:18:16.479 --> 00:18:19.290
that the rewards are much more distant. Um, AND

407
00:18:19.290 --> 00:18:20.770
the problem for that for people that are studying,

408
00:18:20.810 --> 00:18:22.650
obviously, is, is most of the things, most of

409
00:18:22.650 --> 00:18:25.050
the rewards you'll get as a student, are located

410
00:18:25.050 --> 00:18:27.609
at some point in some hypothetical future. You know,

411
00:18:27.689 --> 00:18:29.219
if I, if I invest that time doing this

412
00:18:29.219 --> 00:18:32.130
essay now in 2 or 3 years' time, you

413
00:18:32.130 --> 00:18:33.609
know, I'll, I'll get a degree, as it were,

414
00:18:33.729 --> 00:18:37.209
hopefully a good degree. So that's something, that's why

415
00:18:37.209 --> 00:18:39.319
one of the reasons why procrastinationism is a problem

416
00:18:39.319 --> 00:18:42.010
for students. It's because of this sort of hyperbolic

417
00:18:42.010 --> 00:18:47.000
discounting tendency. Um, BUT hyperbolic discounting also has a,

418
00:18:47.010 --> 00:18:49.339
uh, if you like a. A brother at arms

419
00:18:49.339 --> 00:18:52.619
or enabler, and it's called the planning fallacy, and

420
00:18:52.619 --> 00:18:55.300
the planning fallacy um refers to the fact that

421
00:18:55.300 --> 00:18:58.780
we're not very good at estimating how long things

422
00:18:58.780 --> 00:19:01.339
will take and, Anyone that's probably had builders in

423
00:19:01.339 --> 00:19:03.770
will, will, will be an expert on this already,

424
00:19:03.979 --> 00:19:06.260
sorry to all the builders out there. Um, BUT

425
00:19:06.260 --> 00:19:09.339
we tend to, you know, grossly underestimate how long

426
00:19:09.339 --> 00:19:11.699
things will take to do. And this is particularly

427
00:19:11.699 --> 00:19:14.300
true of, of, of students who often have very

428
00:19:14.300 --> 00:19:17.060
complicated tasks that, you know, are, are, are extremely

429
00:19:17.060 --> 00:19:18.859
involved and occur over quite a long period of

430
00:19:18.859 --> 00:19:21.459
time. And indeed some of the research that's been

431
00:19:21.459 --> 00:19:24.459
done on this has been uh done asking students

432
00:19:24.459 --> 00:19:25.900
to estimate how long it will take them to

433
00:19:25.900 --> 00:19:29.130
do their final year dissertation. And the kind of

434
00:19:29.130 --> 00:19:31.729
research that's done will will approach students and say

435
00:19:31.729 --> 00:19:33.969
to them, OK, I want, I want 3 estimates

436
00:19:33.969 --> 00:19:35.849
from you now. All of them relate to how

437
00:19:35.849 --> 00:19:37.239
long it will take you to do your final

438
00:19:37.239 --> 00:19:41.219
destination, uh, dissertation. Um, THE first estimate I want

439
00:19:41.219 --> 00:19:43.719
you to give me is your best case scenario.

440
00:19:43.849 --> 00:19:45.890
So if everything that can go right does go

441
00:19:45.890 --> 00:19:48.869
right, how long is it gonna take? The second,

442
00:19:48.910 --> 00:19:51.880
um, scenario is, you know, the exact opposite, which

443
00:19:51.880 --> 00:19:54.199
is assume that everything that could go wrong does

444
00:19:54.199 --> 00:19:56.000
go wrong, how long do you think it will

445
00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:59.530
take then? So a pessimistic estimate. And the third

446
00:19:59.530 --> 00:20:01.719
thing is, OK, just tell us now, what's your

447
00:20:01.719 --> 00:20:04.359
most accurate guess, you know, uh, all things going

448
00:20:04.359 --> 00:20:06.640
well, all things going badly be damned. How long

449
00:20:06.640 --> 00:20:08.709
do you actually think it's gonna take? And then

450
00:20:08.709 --> 00:20:10.729
obviously what you can do is after the students

451
00:20:10.729 --> 00:20:12.910
completed their dissertation, you can compare how long it

452
00:20:12.910 --> 00:20:16.589
actually took them to how long they um anticipated

453
00:20:16.589 --> 00:20:19.189
it would take in their three estimates. And what

454
00:20:19.189 --> 00:20:22.949
that research found was that students were underestimating how

455
00:20:22.949 --> 00:20:25.420
long it took, even in relation to their most,

456
00:20:25.510 --> 00:20:28.910
you know, um, pessimistic, um, sod law case scenario

457
00:20:28.910 --> 00:20:30.670
of everything that can go wrong will go wrong.

458
00:20:30.954 --> 00:20:34.074
I think by about 30% as well. So the,

459
00:20:34.135 --> 00:20:35.594
the problem, it's a bit of a double whammy

460
00:20:35.594 --> 00:20:37.755
there because, you know, we, we tend to leave

461
00:20:37.755 --> 00:20:39.354
things to the last minute, as it were, and

462
00:20:39.354 --> 00:20:41.395
we don't realize that things can't really be done

463
00:20:41.395 --> 00:20:42.875
at the last minute and we need longer than

464
00:20:42.875 --> 00:20:45.834
we think. Um, SO those are two things that,

465
00:20:46.074 --> 00:20:50.185
that make procrastination, I think, particularly difficult because they're,

466
00:20:50.314 --> 00:20:52.515
they're kind of baked into our psychology, really, these

467
00:20:52.515 --> 00:20:53.035
two things.

468
00:20:54.280 --> 00:20:57.520
Uh, AND apart from these more general tendencies that

469
00:20:57.520 --> 00:21:01.319
I would imagine everyone shares when it comes to

470
00:21:01.319 --> 00:21:05.000
procrastination, is, does it have anything to do with

471
00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:08.189
individual differences? Are there, for example, people that are,

472
00:21:08.369 --> 00:21:12.109
that have a higher tendency to procrastinate than others,

473
00:21:12.319 --> 00:21:15.969
perhaps because of their personality traits, for example?

474
00:21:16.760 --> 00:21:19.224
Um, IT'S kind of, it's. All the people think

475
00:21:19.224 --> 00:21:22.155
that, I think. Um, THERE is some relationship with

476
00:21:22.155 --> 00:21:25.224
individual differences insofar as when you look at the

477
00:21:25.224 --> 00:21:28.864
interaction between the task that someone's procrastinating on and

478
00:21:28.864 --> 00:21:31.385
the way that the person perceives that task. So

479
00:21:31.385 --> 00:21:33.854
for example, the, in terms of sort of affect,

480
00:21:33.974 --> 00:21:37.704
the sort of three reliable predictors of procrastination, uh,

481
00:21:37.775 --> 00:21:39.744
and none of these will surprise you. One of

482
00:21:39.744 --> 00:21:42.025
them is boredom, so we procrastinate on things that

483
00:21:42.025 --> 00:21:45.060
we find boring. Um, ANOTHER thing is resentment. We

484
00:21:45.060 --> 00:21:47.699
procrastinate on things that we resent doing. And the

485
00:21:47.699 --> 00:21:51.060
final thing is frustration. We tend to procrastinate if

486
00:21:51.060 --> 00:21:53.969
we find something frustrating. And, and if you can

487
00:21:53.969 --> 00:21:55.380
imagine, if you're the, if you're a student at

488
00:21:55.380 --> 00:21:58.540
the moment who is not really enjoying studying cos

489
00:21:58.540 --> 00:22:00.540
you're not going about it the right way, the

490
00:22:00.540 --> 00:22:03.420
chances are you're gonna find studying boring, you're gonna

491
00:22:03.420 --> 00:22:05.579
resent doing it, and it's gonna be frustrating when

492
00:22:05.579 --> 00:22:07.099
you don't get the results you think you should

493
00:22:07.099 --> 00:22:09.540
be getting. Which is why procrastination can be a

494
00:22:09.540 --> 00:22:12.439
real issue for students. But. In terms of personality

495
00:22:12.439 --> 00:22:15.400
traits, the answer really is no, not directly. There

496
00:22:15.400 --> 00:22:18.319
isn't a smoking gun, uh, in terms of a

497
00:22:18.319 --> 00:22:22.479
particular personality type, that means you'll either be completely

498
00:22:22.479 --> 00:22:27.319
predi predisposed towards procrastination or a personality type that

499
00:22:27.319 --> 00:22:30.430
means you're completely, you know, immune from it. Um,

500
00:22:30.640 --> 00:22:34.079
THERE are some elements of certain personality traits. So

501
00:22:34.079 --> 00:22:36.719
for example, if you're an extrovert, one element of

502
00:22:36.719 --> 00:22:39.479
that might be, um, that you have a high

503
00:22:39.479 --> 00:22:42.500
degree of impulsivity. Um, AND that might make you

504
00:22:42.500 --> 00:22:45.270
a little bit more prone to procrastination. Equally, if

505
00:22:45.270 --> 00:22:48.589
you're perhaps high in conscientiousness, things like your, your

506
00:22:48.589 --> 00:22:52.349
resistance to, um, uh, I suppose temptation, your resistance

507
00:22:52.349 --> 00:22:55.390
to being distracted, um, might, might, might, you know,

508
00:22:55.550 --> 00:22:56.869
put you in good stead when it comes to

509
00:22:56.869 --> 00:23:01.010
resisting procrastination. But there isn't really a personality trait

510
00:23:01.010 --> 00:23:02.650
that you could just point out and say it's

511
00:23:02.650 --> 00:23:05.449
that one, as it were. Unfortunately it's something that

512
00:23:05.459 --> 00:23:08.489
that all personality types can struggle with, um, you

513
00:23:08.489 --> 00:23:11.410
know, um, not necessarily equally, but certainly to varying

514
00:23:11.410 --> 00:23:12.040
extents.

515
00:23:13.119 --> 00:23:16.239
And for people who tend to struggle a lot

516
00:23:16.239 --> 00:23:19.510
with procrastination, what would you say are perhaps some

517
00:23:19.510 --> 00:23:25.050
of the best strategies, science-based strategies that can, they

518
00:23:25.050 --> 00:23:26.170
can try to apply?

519
00:23:26.900 --> 00:23:29.810
Yeah, so there's a few things here. Um, ONE

520
00:23:29.810 --> 00:23:32.170
of them, well, let, let's actually, let's try and

521
00:23:32.170 --> 00:23:33.449
relate these back to some of the things we've

522
00:23:33.449 --> 00:23:37.719
talked about previously. So, um, in terms of, um,

523
00:23:37.729 --> 00:23:40.359
the planning fallacy, where we said that people tend

524
00:23:40.359 --> 00:23:43.250
to underestimate how long it will take to do

525
00:23:43.250 --> 00:23:46.890
something, uh, fairly significantly, um, one thing that we

526
00:23:46.890 --> 00:23:49.130
know from research there, and this is one thing

527
00:23:49.130 --> 00:23:51.469
where you're. Your parents will laugh because it's something

528
00:23:51.469 --> 00:23:53.109
they'll probably have always advised you to do and

529
00:23:53.109 --> 00:23:55.699
now science backs them up, as it were. Um,

530
00:23:55.739 --> 00:23:57.869
IS that the, the only thing that seems to

531
00:23:57.869 --> 00:24:00.390
work reliably when it comes to defeating the planning

532
00:24:00.390 --> 00:24:03.670
fallacy is to, at the point you're considering doing

533
00:24:03.670 --> 00:24:06.109
a task, and maybe planning for the amount of

534
00:24:06.109 --> 00:24:08.829
time it will take, um, is to break that

535
00:24:08.829 --> 00:24:13.260
task down very explicitly into its component parts. So

536
00:24:13.270 --> 00:24:16.339
let's take an example with students here. Um, IF

537
00:24:16.339 --> 00:24:18.469
you had an essay to do, for example, and

538
00:24:18.469 --> 00:24:20.670
you want, you know, your calendar and you left

539
00:24:20.670 --> 00:24:23.069
yourself 3 days to do it, um, if your

540
00:24:23.069 --> 00:24:25.390
to do list, if you like, is #1, write

541
00:24:25.390 --> 00:24:28.750
essay, and #2, end of list, then 3 days

542
00:24:28.750 --> 00:24:31.229
might look like a perfectly reasonable amount of time

543
00:24:31.229 --> 00:24:33.910
to, to dedicate to that task. There's probably people

544
00:24:33.910 --> 00:24:35.743
listening now that are going. And blimey, 3 days,

545
00:24:35.822 --> 00:24:37.983
how about 24 hours or the night before it's

546
00:24:37.983 --> 00:24:40.942
due in, you know. But if you then consider

547
00:24:40.942 --> 00:24:43.892
what that task actually entails, and you think, OK,

548
00:24:44.022 --> 00:24:45.973
well, I've got to retrieve the right course notes,

549
00:24:46.142 --> 00:24:48.562
I've got, you know, pop to the library, uh,

550
00:24:48.583 --> 00:24:50.583
and retrieve the right materials. I've got to do

551
00:24:50.583 --> 00:24:52.733
a preliminary scan of these materials to make sure

552
00:24:52.733 --> 00:24:55.022
that they're relevant. I've got to discard the ones

553
00:24:55.022 --> 00:24:57.255
that aren't relevant and start reading the ones. In

554
00:24:57.255 --> 00:24:59.576
more detail that are relevant. I've then got to

555
00:24:59.576 --> 00:25:02.135
produce an essay plan. I've then got to think

556
00:25:02.135 --> 00:25:04.615
about the narrative, um, you know, of that essay,

557
00:25:04.656 --> 00:25:07.215
not just the contents. Um, I've got to draft

558
00:25:07.215 --> 00:25:09.536
it probably a couple of times. I've got to

559
00:25:09.536 --> 00:25:11.176
leave a bit of time, then I've got proofread

560
00:25:11.176 --> 00:25:13.215
it. And you can imagine that list getting bigger

561
00:25:13.215 --> 00:25:15.645
and bigger and bigger. And suddenly that same period

562
00:25:15.645 --> 00:25:17.495
of time of 3 days just doesn't look like

563
00:25:17.495 --> 00:25:19.855
it's gonna cut it anymore. So it's what we

564
00:25:19.855 --> 00:25:21.816
call unpacking, that's just a, it's not really a

565
00:25:21.816 --> 00:25:23.816
technical term, is it? But that's what it's called

566
00:25:23.816 --> 00:25:26.479
in the literature, unpacking. Uh, AND that seems to

567
00:25:26.479 --> 00:25:31.819
work reasonably reliably in, if not completely negating, um,

568
00:25:31.839 --> 00:25:35.550
the, the, the planning fallacy, certainly reducing its magnitude.

569
00:25:35.880 --> 00:25:37.910
So that's one thing that you can do to,

570
00:25:37.920 --> 00:25:41.439
uh, remove that. Now, in terms of hyperbolic discounting,

571
00:25:41.479 --> 00:25:44.079
this, this thing that we, we tend to prefer

572
00:25:44.079 --> 00:25:46.160
doing smaller things that give us small but immediate

573
00:25:46.160 --> 00:25:48.750
rewards over bigger things that give us big but,

574
00:25:48.760 --> 00:25:51.719
you know, um, deferred rewards. One of the things

575
00:25:51.719 --> 00:25:53.880
you can do there. If you've broken down the

576
00:25:53.880 --> 00:25:57.239
task into its component parts, is you can just

577
00:25:57.239 --> 00:26:01.040
arrange to actually reward yourself after those little component

578
00:26:01.040 --> 00:26:04.599
parts. So the rewards are much more frequent um

579
00:26:04.599 --> 00:26:06.439
than they would be if you just said I've

580
00:26:06.439 --> 00:26:08.339
got to do an entire essay and the reward's

581
00:26:08.339 --> 00:26:09.640
gonna have to wait till the end of it.

582
00:26:10.060 --> 00:26:12.660
So that, that unpacking the task has two benefits,

583
00:26:12.670 --> 00:26:14.500
one in that it tends to negate the planning

584
00:26:14.500 --> 00:26:17.430
fallacy, but also in that you can then, if

585
00:26:17.430 --> 00:26:19.589
you just, you know, view each task as a

586
00:26:19.589 --> 00:26:22.069
checkpoint and incorporate a reward at the end of

587
00:26:22.069 --> 00:26:24.989
that, um, you know, that, that's actually a really

588
00:26:24.989 --> 00:26:28.859
good way of dealing with hyperbolic discounting too. The

589
00:26:28.859 --> 00:26:31.479
other thing which, um, most people scoff at because

590
00:26:31.479 --> 00:26:33.829
they don't think that it will work, um, is

591
00:26:33.829 --> 00:26:37.500
what we call implementation intentions. And that's just a

592
00:26:37.510 --> 00:26:39.000
a a bit of a fancy term and all

593
00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:41.680
it means is that if you look at the

594
00:26:41.680 --> 00:26:44.280
research on, on things like motivation, um, what it

595
00:26:44.280 --> 00:26:46.880
will often tell you is that, um, as humans,

596
00:26:46.959 --> 00:26:50.599
we're often better at specifying our goals, i.e. what

597
00:26:50.599 --> 00:26:53.000
we want to achieve. So you've probably heard people

598
00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:54.239
say, you know, I want to get fit or

599
00:26:54.239 --> 00:26:56.640
I wanna develop some muscle mass or whatever else,

600
00:26:56.719 --> 00:26:59.130
you know. We're much better at doing that than

601
00:26:59.130 --> 00:27:03.140
we are specifying the behavior required to achieve those

602
00:27:03.140 --> 00:27:05.819
goals. Uh, AND what this often leads to is

603
00:27:05.819 --> 00:27:08.780
what we call the intention action gap. Um, YOU

604
00:27:08.780 --> 00:27:10.420
know, so you know the new year where everyone

605
00:27:10.420 --> 00:27:13.170
makes good, um, New Year's intentions, and then none

606
00:27:13.170 --> 00:27:15.599
of them really come to pass. Well, the reason

607
00:27:15.599 --> 00:27:18.219
is they specified the goal or the desired outcome,

608
00:27:18.260 --> 00:27:20.459
but they haven't specified the behavior required to reach

609
00:27:20.459 --> 00:27:24.050
that goal. So, and it's very, very doing it

610
00:27:24.050 --> 00:27:26.719
actually specifying the behavior is actually very, very simple.

611
00:27:27.109 --> 00:27:29.479
And there was a wonderful study once which illustrated

612
00:27:29.479 --> 00:27:33.209
this, and uh they essentially invited undergraduates into a

613
00:27:33.209 --> 00:27:35.609
lab to do a study. And the study was

614
00:27:35.609 --> 00:27:37.329
actually just a ruse, it was neither here nor

615
00:27:37.329 --> 00:27:39.689
there, it was a distraction task. The relevant bit

616
00:27:39.689 --> 00:27:42.250
of the experiment occurred at the end. Um, THEY

617
00:27:42.250 --> 00:27:45.390
divided the participants into one of two groups. In

618
00:27:45.390 --> 00:27:48.069
um in one group, the participants were given a

619
00:27:48.069 --> 00:27:50.430
sign up sheet, um, just with a series of,

620
00:27:50.469 --> 00:27:52.189
you know, er er space for them to put

621
00:27:52.189 --> 00:27:54.270
their name and then a space for them to

622
00:27:54.270 --> 00:27:56.589
specify a time. And the reason for that is

623
00:27:56.589 --> 00:27:58.750
the experimenter said, thanks very much for taking part

624
00:27:58.750 --> 00:28:00.750
in this study. Would you mind taking part in

625
00:28:00.750 --> 00:28:03.319
a future study? Uh, THEN the person would sign

626
00:28:03.319 --> 00:28:05.410
up. And that was the first group. The second

627
00:28:05.410 --> 00:28:07.530
group, they got the same sign up sheet, but

628
00:28:07.530 --> 00:28:09.569
the wording was changed slightly, and it was along

629
00:28:09.569 --> 00:28:12.890
the lines of if you commit to attending the

630
00:28:12.890 --> 00:28:16.050
second study at a particular time now, then you

631
00:28:16.050 --> 00:28:18.589
are more likely to show up at this time.

632
00:28:18.930 --> 00:28:20.250
Um, AND then what they did, obviously, is they

633
00:28:20.250 --> 00:28:23.520
compared the two groups in terms of, um, how

634
00:28:23.520 --> 00:28:25.729
many people actually showed up for the second part

635
00:28:25.729 --> 00:28:28.500
of the study. And the difference between the two

636
00:28:28.500 --> 00:28:30.459
groups was, was massive, you know, I think it

637
00:28:30.459 --> 00:28:32.780
was about 60% showed up for the second that

638
00:28:32.780 --> 00:28:34.979
were in the if you uh put your name

639
00:28:34.979 --> 00:28:37.339
down, then you will turn up compared to something

640
00:28:37.339 --> 00:28:40.619
like about 13%, um, in the group that were

641
00:28:40.619 --> 00:28:42.260
just, you know, please sign up for the next

642
00:28:42.260 --> 00:28:45.839
study. And that language of if and then is

643
00:28:45.839 --> 00:28:48.359
actually really important. And the, as weird as it

644
00:28:48.359 --> 00:28:51.130
sounds, the reason it's important is because at at

645
00:28:51.130 --> 00:28:54.119
some level, we, we're always looking for cues in

646
00:28:54.119 --> 00:28:56.640
our environment about what we should, you know, what,

647
00:28:56.680 --> 00:28:59.349
what's the cue of the particular behavior. So if

648
00:28:59.349 --> 00:29:01.959
this happens, then I should do this. And a

649
00:29:01.959 --> 00:29:03.719
lot of behavior at its basic level can be

650
00:29:03.719 --> 00:29:06.790
broken down in that fashion. So to increase the

651
00:29:06.790 --> 00:29:10.140
chances of you doing something in a timely fashion,

652
00:29:10.469 --> 00:29:11.869
what you need to do is set yourself an

653
00:29:11.869 --> 00:29:15.469
implementation intention to do that particular task. So it

654
00:29:15.469 --> 00:29:17.750
could be like, you know, if it's Monday at

655
00:29:17.750 --> 00:29:21.349
6 o'clock, um, then I will immediately proceed to

656
00:29:21.349 --> 00:29:23.630
do the, you know, start on the essay for

657
00:29:23.630 --> 00:29:26.489
this module that I'm studying. Um, OBVIOUSLY, depending on

658
00:29:26.489 --> 00:29:28.180
what your goals are and what the task is,

659
00:29:28.189 --> 00:29:30.160
you'll have to be more specific. ME, but the

660
00:29:30.160 --> 00:29:33.520
key thing there is saying if that's the condition

661
00:29:33.520 --> 00:29:35.280
that alerts you to the fact that there is

662
00:29:35.280 --> 00:29:38.189
a, a, a, a trigger for the behavior, and

663
00:29:38.189 --> 00:29:42.520
then, which is what associates the behavior required to

664
00:29:42.520 --> 00:29:45.589
achieve the goals with that trigger. So that's what

665
00:29:45.589 --> 00:29:47.160
you need to just get in the habit of

666
00:29:47.160 --> 00:29:51.109
doing. Um, AND it, it's a remarkably simple, uh,

667
00:29:51.119 --> 00:29:54.599
but remarkably powerful strategy. For trying to close that,

668
00:29:54.609 --> 00:29:57.609
you know, intention and action gap. So that's what

669
00:29:57.609 --> 00:29:59.329
I always recommend to people, it's you've got to

670
00:29:59.329 --> 00:30:02.810
get good at specifying not just the goal that

671
00:30:02.810 --> 00:30:04.530
you'd like to achieve, you know, saying I've got

672
00:30:04.530 --> 00:30:07.560
to get the essay done, but you've gotta specify

673
00:30:07.810 --> 00:30:09.170
what the cue in the environment will be to

674
00:30:09.170 --> 00:30:11.680
make a start on that task, and then also

675
00:30:11.680 --> 00:30:14.729
um what the associated behavior will be that will

676
00:30:14.729 --> 00:30:17.500
contribute to the resolution of that task. Um, THE

677
00:30:17.500 --> 00:30:20.060
great thing about, um, getting started as well is

678
00:30:20.060 --> 00:30:23.180
that once you've started a task, it's much easier

679
00:30:23.180 --> 00:30:25.180
to keep going because your memory is kind of

680
00:30:25.180 --> 00:30:28.900
biased towards, um, reminding you uncomfortably, and we'll all

681
00:30:28.900 --> 00:30:30.949
have had this experience that, you know, 2 o'clock

682
00:30:30.949 --> 00:30:32.020
in the morning when you wake up in a

683
00:30:32.020 --> 00:30:34.010
panic and remember all the things you were supposed

684
00:30:34.010 --> 00:30:36.250
to do. You haven't yet done, your memory is

685
00:30:36.250 --> 00:30:38.489
actually biased to remind you about the stuff you've

686
00:30:38.489 --> 00:30:41.369
yet to do. Um, YOU kind of sweep aside

687
00:30:41.369 --> 00:30:44.439
fairly quickly the stuff that's already done. Um, SO

688
00:30:44.729 --> 00:30:47.290
just getting the implementation in, in place and actually

689
00:30:47.290 --> 00:30:49.729
starting, uh, on the road to achieving that goal

690
00:30:49.729 --> 00:30:51.560
can be a, a really good thing to do.

691
00:30:51.849 --> 00:30:53.609
So there's a few things that, that you can

692
00:30:53.609 --> 00:30:55.449
do that are, that are backed up by research

693
00:30:55.449 --> 00:30:57.729
that, that negate these tendencies that we have to

694
00:30:57.729 --> 00:30:58.560
procrastinate.

695
00:30:59.589 --> 00:31:03.189
So changing topics now is something that students also

696
00:31:03.189 --> 00:31:05.869
do a lot, not only in class, but also

697
00:31:05.869 --> 00:31:08.579
when they're studying alone at home or in the

698
00:31:08.579 --> 00:31:12.750
library, for example, is they take notes. What the

699
00:31:12.750 --> 00:31:16.349
science tell us about the most effective ways of

700
00:31:16.349 --> 00:31:21.300
taking notes and is, for example, taking notes verbatim

701
00:31:21.300 --> 00:31:22.869
good enough or not?

702
00:31:23.349 --> 00:31:25.489
Um, I, I think the, the first thing about

703
00:31:25.489 --> 00:31:27.530
note taking is you should probably ask when it's

704
00:31:27.530 --> 00:31:29.969
being done, um, because one of the things that

705
00:31:29.969 --> 00:31:32.250
will often happen is if you're a lecturer, for

706
00:31:32.250 --> 00:31:34.089
example, or even a student, you look around the

707
00:31:34.089 --> 00:31:36.050
room, what you might see is people, you know,

708
00:31:36.209 --> 00:31:38.569
spending an entire lecturer just trying to scribble down

709
00:31:38.569 --> 00:31:41.569
everything the lecturer says, you know, and, and self-evidently.

710
00:31:41.734 --> 00:31:44.464
That's really not gonna help. So I, I, I

711
00:31:44.464 --> 00:31:46.744
think really when you're in a lecture, what your

712
00:31:46.744 --> 00:31:49.775
focus should be on is actually attending to the

713
00:31:49.775 --> 00:31:52.505
lecture itself. Uh, IF not for another reason the

714
00:31:52.505 --> 00:31:55.145
lectures are often recorded these days and the slides

715
00:31:55.145 --> 00:31:57.185
available, so there's really no point in just madly

716
00:31:57.185 --> 00:32:00.739
scribbling down, um, what the lecturer says. Now when

717
00:32:00.739 --> 00:32:03.979
it comes to notes, I, I think um one

718
00:32:03.979 --> 00:32:07.260
thing that you really can do um is start

719
00:32:07.260 --> 00:32:09.900
off by narrowing down the, the process of reading.

720
00:32:09.939 --> 00:32:11.660
So when you take notes, you generally take it

721
00:32:11.660 --> 00:32:14.300
on what you read. And a good way of

722
00:32:14.300 --> 00:32:16.819
improving the notes is also narrowing down your reading.

723
00:32:17.189 --> 00:32:19.390
Because I always say to students that look, you

724
00:32:19.390 --> 00:32:21.790
need to start off with some questions, because if

725
00:32:21.790 --> 00:32:24.469
you don't have any questions, the source you're reading

726
00:32:24.469 --> 00:32:27.910
by definition can't give you any answers. So just

727
00:32:27.910 --> 00:32:31.430
reading and taking notes aimlessly is is is very

728
00:32:31.430 --> 00:32:34.229
inefficient and and and rather pointless. So, you know,

729
00:32:34.319 --> 00:32:35.989
it might be, for example, that you're reading a

730
00:32:35.989 --> 00:32:38.589
particular study and the questions you'd like to answer

731
00:32:38.589 --> 00:32:40.949
is, You know, how was this study done and

732
00:32:40.949 --> 00:32:42.800
what were the main findings and maybe what were

733
00:32:42.800 --> 00:32:45.670
the implications. So just start off with some idea

734
00:32:45.670 --> 00:32:47.339
about what you'd like to get from the source,

735
00:32:47.719 --> 00:32:50.270
because immediately what you're then doing is you're interrogating

736
00:32:50.270 --> 00:32:53.589
the source for that information, rather than just blankly

737
00:32:53.589 --> 00:32:55.800
reading it. And then what you're doing is when

738
00:32:55.800 --> 00:32:58.949
you're taking notes, you're taking the salient notes down

739
00:32:58.949 --> 00:33:01.489
rather than just trying to capture everything. So that's,

740
00:33:01.560 --> 00:33:03.969
I, I think a good um a good first

741
00:33:03.969 --> 00:33:06.869
approach. I think the other thing um to do

742
00:33:06.869 --> 00:33:10.770
is when you're taking notes, avoid any kind of

743
00:33:10.770 --> 00:33:14.890
um verbatim copying, because I think some people mistake

744
00:33:14.890 --> 00:33:17.439
activity for progress in this respect and they think,

745
00:33:17.449 --> 00:33:18.849
what I'll do is I'll just copy out the

746
00:33:18.849 --> 00:33:21.959
relevant bits and just the, the action of me

747
00:33:21.959 --> 00:33:24.400
typing this out or writing this down will somehow

748
00:33:24.400 --> 00:33:27.010
enhance my memory. And I hate to break it

749
00:33:27.010 --> 00:33:28.300
to you, I know it feels like busy work

750
00:33:28.300 --> 00:33:29.939
and it feels like it should work, but it

751
00:33:29.939 --> 00:33:32.699
really doesn't. Um, YOU know, copying stuff verbatim is

752
00:33:32.699 --> 00:33:34.969
no more effective than just rereading it, which itself

753
00:33:34.969 --> 00:33:38.349
is, isn't particularly effective. So, um, what I would

754
00:33:38.349 --> 00:33:41.420
say there is avoid, um, copying things verbatim. If

755
00:33:41.420 --> 00:33:43.500
you're going to commit anything to paper, what it

756
00:33:43.500 --> 00:33:48.089
really should be is your understanding of that material.

757
00:33:48.550 --> 00:33:51.750
So, and this really relates to, um, I, I

758
00:33:51.750 --> 00:33:52.949
don't know if we've got questions about this later,

759
00:33:52.989 --> 00:33:55.060
but this relates to how your memory works in

760
00:33:55.060 --> 00:33:57.630
that your memory isn't reproductive in nature. I, I

761
00:33:57.630 --> 00:33:59.619
know it feels like it sometimes but it, it,

762
00:33:59.630 --> 00:34:02.069
it feels like it's some, you know, old Victorian

763
00:34:02.069 --> 00:34:04.270
camera where you have to point it at something

764
00:34:04.270 --> 00:34:06.510
for about an hour. And if anything moves in

765
00:34:06.510 --> 00:34:08.228
the source or the frame, you know, that it's

766
00:34:08.228 --> 00:34:11.183
ruined and. Gotta start from scratch. But if you're

767
00:34:11.183 --> 00:34:13.552
trying to study like that, that's why you're not

768
00:34:13.552 --> 00:34:17.532
having much success, because your memory isn't really designed

769
00:34:17.532 --> 00:34:20.982
to reproduce information verbatim. What it's there is to

770
00:34:20.982 --> 00:34:23.623
create meaning, and it's there, and because it's there

771
00:34:23.623 --> 00:34:25.183
to create meaning, what it wants you to do

772
00:34:25.183 --> 00:34:28.502
is to reconstruct the information, so it's reconstructed in

773
00:34:28.502 --> 00:34:31.815
nature. Not reproductive. So the question when it comes

774
00:34:31.815 --> 00:34:33.696
to things like note taking is, how do you

775
00:34:33.696 --> 00:34:37.416
take advantage of the reconstructive nature of memory? And

776
00:34:37.416 --> 00:34:39.156
one of the really good ways to do that

777
00:34:39.375 --> 00:34:42.255
is by trying to explain things in your own

778
00:34:42.255 --> 00:34:44.775
words. So one of the approaches that gets some

779
00:34:44.775 --> 00:34:47.135
attention and it is reasonably well supported by the

780
00:34:47.135 --> 00:34:50.416
research is to use elaborative interrogation. So the idea

781
00:34:50.416 --> 00:34:52.696
is that as you're reading a source, you start

782
00:34:52.696 --> 00:34:55.804
to annotate that source with some questions to yourself.

783
00:34:56.399 --> 00:34:59.010
And then you have to answer those questions using

784
00:34:59.010 --> 00:35:01.469
the source, but you have to articulate it in

785
00:35:01.469 --> 00:35:03.649
your own words. So what that means is you're

786
00:35:03.649 --> 00:35:07.129
basically thinking about the material and how you would

787
00:35:07.129 --> 00:35:09.250
explain it rather than just trying to regurgitate what

788
00:35:09.250 --> 00:35:12.649
someone else is saying. And as anyone that plays

789
00:35:12.649 --> 00:35:14.969
an instrument will know, it's much easier to remember

790
00:35:14.969 --> 00:35:17.189
your own composition than to remember the composition of

791
00:35:17.189 --> 00:35:19.570
someone else. Uh, AND the reason because of that

792
00:35:19.570 --> 00:35:21.419
is that when you think about it, I think

793
00:35:21.419 --> 00:35:24.169
Daniel Willingham had a beautiful quote about memory, and

794
00:35:24.169 --> 00:35:26.360
he said that memory is the residue of thought.

795
00:35:26.820 --> 00:35:29.639
And I think that's a lovely way of of

796
00:35:29.649 --> 00:35:32.139
of kind of getting it across to people what

797
00:35:32.139 --> 00:35:33.350
you have to do to be able to remember

798
00:35:33.350 --> 00:35:35.669
things. Um, YOU can't just stare at them, you

799
00:35:35.669 --> 00:35:38.350
can't just passively look at them. You've got to

800
00:35:38.350 --> 00:35:40.030
engage with them and you've got to use methods

801
00:35:40.030 --> 00:35:43.310
that force you to explain and to elaborate and

802
00:35:43.310 --> 00:35:46.590
to interrogate and to think. Because what you tend

803
00:35:46.590 --> 00:35:48.949
to put the most effort into thinking about really

804
00:35:48.949 --> 00:35:51.790
determines what you remember. It's not just about duration.

805
00:35:52.439 --> 00:35:55.560
Or repetition, um, it's really about investing effort into

806
00:35:55.560 --> 00:35:57.959
thinking. So I think in summary, what you need

807
00:35:57.959 --> 00:36:00.520
to do is start by narrowing down what you're

808
00:36:00.520 --> 00:36:03.379
reading, what you're taking notes on, um, have some

809
00:36:03.379 --> 00:36:06.850
questions in mind, um, interrogate the text with respect

810
00:36:06.850 --> 00:36:09.840
to those questions, and then try and explain the

811
00:36:09.840 --> 00:36:12.840
key points in your own words. Um, I, I,

812
00:36:12.959 --> 00:36:16.080
I, I kind of emphasize the word explain because

813
00:36:16.080 --> 00:36:20.250
explanation. Tends to trump things like description. Um, JUST

814
00:36:20.250 --> 00:36:23.610
describing something, um, it's OK, particularly if you're describing

815
00:36:23.610 --> 00:36:25.969
your own words, but if you really want to

816
00:36:25.969 --> 00:36:28.969
understand something, understanding the workings of it by explaining

817
00:36:28.969 --> 00:36:31.530
it are, are much more kind of productive. It's

818
00:36:31.530 --> 00:36:33.530
a bit like the difference between distinction we kind

819
00:36:33.530 --> 00:36:35.810
of raised earlier between being able to recall something

820
00:36:35.810 --> 00:36:38.330
and understanding it. Often if you like, the division

821
00:36:38.330 --> 00:36:40.370
bell between that is can you explain it or

822
00:36:40.370 --> 00:36:42.129
not, OK? Mhm.

823
00:36:42.760 --> 00:36:48.689
So perhaps somewhat related to note taking this summarization

824
00:36:48.939 --> 00:36:49.419
work?

825
00:36:50.479 --> 00:36:54.669
Um, RIGHT, summarization things like summarization and highlighting, um,

826
00:36:54.840 --> 00:36:58.120
the, well, summarization first, the material is a little

827
00:36:58.120 --> 00:37:01.899
bit, um, um, I, I don't know, it's, it's,

828
00:37:02.040 --> 00:37:03.800
it's a bit kind of both ways when it

829
00:37:03.800 --> 00:37:05.679
comes to summarization, and I think the reason for

830
00:37:05.679 --> 00:37:08.479
that is that it, whether it works depends on

831
00:37:08.479 --> 00:37:11.280
how good you are at it. And to a

832
00:37:11.280 --> 00:37:13.719
certain extent, the same thing is true at highlighting.

833
00:37:14.260 --> 00:37:18.179
The problem here um becomes the fact that the

834
00:37:18.179 --> 00:37:20.919
people that tend to rely on things like summarization

835
00:37:20.919 --> 00:37:23.979
and highlighting the most are often the least skilled

836
00:37:23.979 --> 00:37:27.679
at using it. Um, SO what, what you'll often

837
00:37:27.679 --> 00:37:30.479
find there is, um, we'll just jump to highlighting

838
00:37:30.479 --> 00:37:33.199
as an example, people will, will highlight way too

839
00:37:33.199 --> 00:37:35.790
much. And they won't really put much thought into

840
00:37:35.790 --> 00:37:38.760
what they're highlighting, which is a problem because the

841
00:37:38.760 --> 00:37:41.750
research that has shown an effect of highlighting, um,

842
00:37:41.919 --> 00:37:44.320
tends to indicate that it's, it's not the highlighting

843
00:37:44.320 --> 00:37:47.419
per se, it's the amount of thought that's gone

844
00:37:47.419 --> 00:37:50.969
into why something is highlighted. Um, THAT tends to

845
00:37:50.969 --> 00:37:55.260
produce the result. Now, with summarization again, the danger

846
00:37:55.260 --> 00:37:58.469
is that you can either completely overegg the pudding

847
00:37:58.739 --> 00:38:00.590
and just write, you know, a huge essay on

848
00:38:00.590 --> 00:38:02.729
a topic that only really needs a few sentences,

849
00:38:03.100 --> 00:38:06.340
or you could completely undershoot and not give enough

850
00:38:06.340 --> 00:38:09.610
information for that summary to be useful. So I

851
00:38:09.610 --> 00:38:13.570
think as a starting strategy, summarization is perhaps a

852
00:38:13.570 --> 00:38:15.850
little bit risky. I, I would tend to steer

853
00:38:15.850 --> 00:38:19.729
people towards things like elaborate, uh, elaborative interrogation and

854
00:38:19.729 --> 00:38:23.330
retrieval practice. Um, THERE are ways around it. So,

855
00:38:23.370 --> 00:38:27.080
for example, in psychology, when we're talking about, um,

856
00:38:27.229 --> 00:38:29.344
study. AND students want to try and remember what

857
00:38:29.344 --> 00:38:31.705
a study is. One way of making your summaries

858
00:38:31.705 --> 00:38:34.344
more effective is to have a mental template of

859
00:38:34.344 --> 00:38:36.544
things you need to cover. So for any study,

860
00:38:36.625 --> 00:38:38.425
if you want to summarize it, you probably need

861
00:38:38.425 --> 00:38:41.465
something about why that study was done, something about

862
00:38:41.465 --> 00:38:43.864
how it was done, what the main finding was,

863
00:38:43.905 --> 00:38:46.294
and then what the implications of that finding is.

864
00:38:46.629 --> 00:38:49.739
So, um, once you, you get reasonably practiced at

865
00:38:49.739 --> 00:38:52.340
doing that, uh, and you can audit the quality

866
00:38:52.340 --> 00:38:54.939
of your summaries, it becomes more effective. But I

867
00:38:54.939 --> 00:38:57.580
think a safer way is to focus on things

868
00:38:57.580 --> 00:39:00.530
like retrieval practice. And, um, you can use, like,

869
00:39:00.580 --> 00:39:02.060
we'll probably come into this a bit later, perhaps

870
00:39:02.060 --> 00:39:05.659
3R method, um, as well. So like this might

871
00:39:05.659 --> 00:39:07.330
be your next question actually. Ricardo, so I'll, I'll,

872
00:39:07.570 --> 00:39:09.530
um, should I cover this now or just leave

873
00:39:09.530 --> 00:39:10.889
it for the moment and come back to it?

874
00:39:10.969 --> 00:39:12.929
Uh, YES, I was just going to say that

875
00:39:12.929 --> 00:39:15.209
just to close off this section and then for

876
00:39:15.209 --> 00:39:18.209
us to talk about things like academic integrity and

877
00:39:18.209 --> 00:39:21.639
some other related topics in the book, you, uh,

878
00:39:21.649 --> 00:39:25.409
talk about the 3R method, read recite review. So

879
00:39:25.409 --> 00:39:26.270
could you explain?

880
00:39:26.840 --> 00:39:30.189
Yeah, absolutely. Well, this is a really nice um

881
00:39:30.189 --> 00:39:35.040
er relatively simple and organic way of incorporating retrieval

882
00:39:35.040 --> 00:39:40.620
practice, um elaborative interrogation. And this idea of repetition,

883
00:39:40.629 --> 00:39:43.830
but doing it very proposively, you know, actually having

884
00:39:43.830 --> 00:39:46.629
that, that mental effort required to retrieve memories uh

885
00:39:46.629 --> 00:39:49.590
and putting effort into doing those things. Um, SO

886
00:39:49.590 --> 00:39:52.110
what you do, uh, it's, it's really simple. First

887
00:39:52.110 --> 00:39:53.840
of all, unfortunately, there's no way around this, you

888
00:39:53.840 --> 00:39:55.989
are gonna have to read the material. But the,

889
00:39:56.030 --> 00:39:57.909
the key thing to note here is you do

890
00:39:57.909 --> 00:40:00.510
need to read in small chunks. One of the

891
00:40:00.510 --> 00:40:02.159
mistakes that students often make is they'll try and

892
00:40:02.159 --> 00:40:05.770
read an entire book chapter or um. An entire

893
00:40:05.770 --> 00:40:08.459
article in one go, and that's really no good.

894
00:40:08.610 --> 00:40:10.270
You, you, you won't be able to recall the,

895
00:40:10.290 --> 00:40:12.489
the, the important parts of that just particularly with

896
00:40:12.489 --> 00:40:14.709
one pass, it will be very frustrating for you.

897
00:40:15.090 --> 00:40:17.639
A good strategy instead is to take the piece

898
00:40:17.639 --> 00:40:19.689
apart and put it into chunks. So one way

899
00:40:19.689 --> 00:40:20.870
of doing that might be to look at it,

900
00:40:20.929 --> 00:40:23.229
break it down into paragraphs. And what you do

901
00:40:23.229 --> 00:40:25.860
is then for every paragraph, you read it, um,

902
00:40:25.909 --> 00:40:28.270
you put it to one side and then you

903
00:40:28.270 --> 00:40:31.110
try and recite, um, either verbally or I, I

904
00:40:31.110 --> 00:40:33.070
tend to prefer typing, um, what I, what I

905
00:40:33.070 --> 00:40:35.060
can recall out because that then becomes the basis

906
00:40:35.060 --> 00:40:38.050
for your notes. Um, YOU try and type out

907
00:40:38.050 --> 00:40:39.899
with the source out of sight, it's very important

908
00:40:39.899 --> 00:40:41.250
you don't look at the source when you're doing

909
00:40:41.250 --> 00:40:44.969
this. You try and recite the main points of

910
00:40:44.969 --> 00:40:47.530
that particular part of the source. And that's really

911
00:40:47.530 --> 00:40:49.689
important because what you're not trying to do is

912
00:40:49.689 --> 00:40:51.989
to recreate that source verbatim. You're not trying to

913
00:40:51.989 --> 00:40:54.919
remember every single word of that passage of text.

914
00:40:55.409 --> 00:40:57.330
Um, YOU just want to remember the important point

915
00:40:57.330 --> 00:40:58.760
and you just want to get your facts straight,

916
00:40:58.850 --> 00:41:02.300
so you're factually accurate. So, having done that, what

917
00:41:02.300 --> 00:41:03.860
you'll then need to do is to audit what

918
00:41:03.860 --> 00:41:06.360
you've written against the source again. Um, SO that's

919
00:41:06.360 --> 00:41:08.979
the review part of the equation. So you take

920
00:41:08.979 --> 00:41:10.870
your source and you put it back in IShot

921
00:41:11.060 --> 00:41:13.699
and then you compare what you've written to the

922
00:41:13.699 --> 00:41:16.050
actual details of the source. But here's the thing,

923
00:41:16.340 --> 00:41:19.379
once again, you're not trying to compare what you've

924
00:41:19.379 --> 00:41:22.580
written, um, and asking yourself things like, is it

925
00:41:22.580 --> 00:41:24.780
as detailed as the original? Is it as eloquent

926
00:41:24.780 --> 00:41:27.540
as the original author? What you're, what you're audited

927
00:41:27.540 --> 00:41:30.825
in your, your recitation. 4 is, have I captured

928
00:41:30.825 --> 00:41:33.726
the main point or points? Have I captured it

929
00:41:33.726 --> 00:41:36.785
in my own words, and is it accurate? And

930
00:41:36.785 --> 00:41:39.085
that's it. Once you can do that, and it

931
00:41:39.085 --> 00:41:41.246
will probably take a few goes, um, you know,

932
00:41:41.345 --> 00:41:44.006
I think people expect success too quickly, and it

933
00:41:44.006 --> 00:41:46.365
goes back to that, um, analogy we used earlier

934
00:41:46.365 --> 00:41:49.406
about, um, retrieval practice being a bit like going.

935
00:41:49.511 --> 00:41:51.662
To the gym, um, you know, it's, it's the

936
00:41:51.662 --> 00:41:53.902
failure to retrieve is helpful as well as the

937
00:41:53.902 --> 00:41:56.302
successful retrievals. But what you do is you should

938
00:41:56.302 --> 00:41:59.662
repeat that process of reading, reciting, and reviewing until

939
00:41:59.662 --> 00:42:03.342
you're satisfied that you can, um, recall the crux

940
00:42:03.342 --> 00:42:06.501
of that passage of text accurately. And once you

941
00:42:06.501 --> 00:42:08.102
do that, you then move on to the next

942
00:42:08.102 --> 00:42:10.072
part of the document and you rinse and repeat.

943
00:42:10.449 --> 00:42:13.939
And if you do that, um, what basically happens

944
00:42:13.939 --> 00:42:17.780
then is you are, you're naturally incorporating, um, asking

945
00:42:17.780 --> 00:42:21.020
questions to the text, um, trying to retrieve answers,

946
00:42:21.219 --> 00:42:23.969
um, elaborative interrogation cos you're trying to explain things

947
00:42:23.969 --> 00:42:26.340
and articulate things in your own words, and you're

948
00:42:26.340 --> 00:42:28.979
getting that kind of practice in as well, that

949
00:42:28.979 --> 00:42:32.620
repetition. So it's a really nice way um of

950
00:42:32.620 --> 00:42:35.020
studying and incorporating those good practice elements that we

951
00:42:35.020 --> 00:42:37.989
talked about into a kind of simple study strategy.

952
00:42:39.429 --> 00:42:42.040
So moving on then to the topic of academic

953
00:42:42.040 --> 00:42:46.159
integrity, I am curious, why was it that you

954
00:42:46.159 --> 00:42:49.719
decided to include such a topic in the book

955
00:42:49.719 --> 00:42:53.439
about the psychology of effective uh studying? Why do

956
00:42:53.439 --> 00:42:55.070
you think it is important?

957
00:42:55.399 --> 00:42:58.159
Yeah, well, it's important for a couple of reasons

958
00:42:58.159 --> 00:43:01.159
really. I mean, the first, the first reason is

959
00:43:01.159 --> 00:43:04.879
that academic integrity is, is kind of fundamentally important

960
00:43:04.879 --> 00:43:07.719
because it relates basically to concepts like fairness and

961
00:43:07.719 --> 00:43:10.840
honesty. Um, WHEN you're studying, uh, and I thought

962
00:43:10.840 --> 00:43:12.679
those were things that from an ethical point of

963
00:43:12.679 --> 00:43:16.360
view, um, needed to be covered. But there's quite

964
00:43:16.360 --> 00:43:19.800
an interesting study from psychology actually, because this is

965
00:43:19.800 --> 00:43:23.310
one area of studying where people tend to be

966
00:43:23.310 --> 00:43:26.600
a bit overconfident, um, in their knowledge of basic

967
00:43:26.600 --> 00:43:29.159
concepts like, you know, what is citation, what is

968
00:43:29.159 --> 00:43:33.550
referencing, what's the difference between citation and quotation. Um,

969
00:43:33.620 --> 00:43:36.909
AND the problem is, overconfidence in this respect can

970
00:43:36.909 --> 00:43:38.899
be very costly because you could end up with,

971
00:43:38.979 --> 00:43:41.540
you know, breach of regulations and being called in

972
00:43:41.540 --> 00:43:44.820
for the university equivalent of disciplinary action. So, obviously

973
00:43:44.820 --> 00:43:46.729
we want students to be able to avoid that.

974
00:43:47.060 --> 00:43:49.610
But from, from an effective studying point of view,

975
00:43:49.899 --> 00:43:52.820
um, the reason it's there is because what you

976
00:43:52.820 --> 00:43:55.419
find is that one of the reasons that people,

977
00:43:55.540 --> 00:43:59.320
um, might plagiarize things, um, is that they've used

978
00:43:59.320 --> 00:44:02.810
ineffective methods of studying, such as verbatim note taking.

979
00:44:03.590 --> 00:44:05.750
So let's run through an example just to illustrate

980
00:44:05.750 --> 00:44:09.189
this. Um, IF your approach to note taking is

981
00:44:09.189 --> 00:44:11.629
that you, um, you write down the words of

982
00:44:11.629 --> 00:44:15.149
another author verbatim, and obviously at that point you

983
00:44:15.149 --> 00:44:17.510
are not intending for that material to find its

984
00:44:17.510 --> 00:44:22.270
way into your essay. The problem is, um, what

985
00:44:22.270 --> 00:44:25.550
can happen over time, particularly if you put those

986
00:44:25.550 --> 00:44:27.110
notes away and you come back to them perhaps

987
00:44:27.110 --> 00:44:29.669
a couple of months later, is you get kind

988
00:44:29.669 --> 00:44:33.449
of a source of monitoring confusion whereby, You misattribute

989
00:44:33.449 --> 00:44:36.449
where that information comes from. So rather than saying,

990
00:44:36.489 --> 00:44:38.610
OK, these notes are clearly from another source, these

991
00:44:38.610 --> 00:44:42.129
are not my words, it's perfectly possible, particularly if

992
00:44:42.129 --> 00:44:44.409
you've been thinking about that information in the interim.

993
00:44:44.790 --> 00:44:47.550
To misattribute those words and think, OK, actually I

994
00:44:47.550 --> 00:44:49.709
think I did produce that. And then of course

995
00:44:49.709 --> 00:44:51.510
that that verbatim copy and it ends up in

996
00:44:51.510 --> 00:44:54.270
your essay and you get into hot water. And

997
00:44:54.270 --> 00:44:57.429
that isn't really, um, any, a reflection on any

998
00:44:57.429 --> 00:45:00.350
deliberate dishonesty on the on the student's part. It's

999
00:45:00.350 --> 00:45:04.534
just an ineffective method of studying. That is conducive

1000
00:45:04.854 --> 00:45:09.604
to um to an academic integrity offense. So one

1001
00:45:09.604 --> 00:45:13.245
way that you can really reduce the chance of

1002
00:45:13.245 --> 00:45:16.524
you ever getting into any trouble whatsoever when it

1003
00:45:16.524 --> 00:45:20.405
comes to academic integrity is just by using effective

1004
00:45:20.405 --> 00:45:22.360
methods of studying. So if we look at a

1005
00:45:22.360 --> 00:45:26.000
positive case study now, if you make notes by

1006
00:45:26.399 --> 00:45:28.479
always explaining things in your own words, asking questions

1007
00:45:28.479 --> 00:45:31.510
in the text, explaining things in your own words,

1008
00:45:31.520 --> 00:45:33.840
then whether those notes make it into your essay

1009
00:45:33.840 --> 00:45:35.520
or not is irrelevant because it's in your words

1010
00:45:35.520 --> 00:45:37.580
then. So as long as you're giving credit to

1011
00:45:37.580 --> 00:45:39.760
the person who originally had the idea with the

1012
00:45:39.760 --> 00:45:42.560
citation, it's, it's pretty much impossible for you to

1013
00:45:42.560 --> 00:45:46.159
go wrong. So, in, in some ways, good studying

1014
00:45:46.159 --> 00:45:50.520
habits are also good academic integrity habits. Um, ANOTHER

1015
00:45:50.520 --> 00:45:53.760
example is procrastination. We talked about this earlier. The

1016
00:45:53.760 --> 00:45:56.560
research and academic integrity and, and why students sometimes

1017
00:45:56.560 --> 00:45:59.189
fall foul of it is that they do something

1018
00:45:59.189 --> 00:46:00.600
at the last minute because they put it off

1019
00:46:00.600 --> 00:46:02.520
and put it off, and suddenly they've had to

1020
00:46:02.520 --> 00:46:05.040
use some fairly dubious practices just to get the

1021
00:46:05.040 --> 00:46:09.104
essay done. Um, SO, no. Knowing about things like

1022
00:46:09.314 --> 00:46:12.834
how to beat procrastination, how to study effectively, um,

1023
00:46:12.915 --> 00:46:14.794
there are, there are very clear links between that

1024
00:46:14.794 --> 00:46:18.675
knowledge and also learning how to be what, cos

1025
00:46:18.675 --> 00:46:20.475
we, we call it academic integrity, but I think

1026
00:46:20.475 --> 00:46:22.004
I'd prefer to it as knowing how to be

1027
00:46:22.004 --> 00:46:24.995
an ethical academic, uh, and, and someone who behaves

1028
00:46:24.995 --> 00:46:27.195
ethically in the idea of knowledge production and knowledge

1029
00:46:27.195 --> 00:46:30.314
dissemination, which anyone in academia really should be, you

1030
00:46:30.314 --> 00:46:31.425
know, on board with a cigar.

1031
00:46:32.750 --> 00:46:35.610
So what would you say are perhaps the most

1032
00:46:35.610 --> 00:46:39.179
important pieces of advice for people to follow when

1033
00:46:39.179 --> 00:46:42.399
they're writing assessments at degree level?

1034
00:46:43.429 --> 00:46:46.750
OK, so I think um. There's a few things

1035
00:46:46.750 --> 00:46:49.350
to note, um, uh, and this was interesting because

1036
00:46:49.350 --> 00:46:51.229
this was the one chapter of the book. I,

1037
00:46:51.310 --> 00:46:53.030
you know, it's, it's interesting you picked out on

1038
00:46:53.030 --> 00:46:55.379
why is the, the section on, um, uh, on,

1039
00:46:55.389 --> 00:46:58.270
um, academic integrity there, cos the, the question I

1040
00:46:58.270 --> 00:47:01.030
usually get is, is, what could you possibly hope

1041
00:47:01.030 --> 00:47:04.909
to say about academic, um, you know, completing assessments

1042
00:47:04.909 --> 00:47:07.350
at degree level, given that you're talking to students

1043
00:47:07.350 --> 00:47:11.550
of all disciplines from all types of institutions and

1044
00:47:11.550 --> 00:47:14.500
across many different types of assessment. Um, WELL, the

1045
00:47:14.500 --> 00:47:17.139
honest answer is, is that they're, again, much in

1046
00:47:17.139 --> 00:47:18.820
the same way as the first chapter when I

1047
00:47:18.820 --> 00:47:21.540
talk about metacognitive problems and how they can lead

1048
00:47:21.540 --> 00:47:25.510
to an effective studying practices. Similar metacognitive problems can

1049
00:47:25.510 --> 00:47:29.129
also create problems when you're writing. So the first

1050
00:47:29.129 --> 00:47:31.540
thing that students often, um, fall foul of when

1051
00:47:31.540 --> 00:47:33.979
they're doing an assessment is not being clear on

1052
00:47:33.979 --> 00:47:38.020
what the expectations are. And this often refers to

1053
00:47:38.020 --> 00:47:39.899
kind of, you know, this illusion of knowledge that

1054
00:47:39.899 --> 00:47:42.750
we might have touched upon earlier. Where they mistake

1055
00:47:42.750 --> 00:47:44.989
being able to recall, let's say part of the

1056
00:47:44.989 --> 00:47:49.629
marking criteria for understanding the marking criteria. So, you

1057
00:47:49.629 --> 00:47:51.469
know, you may, you may see something in your

1058
00:47:51.469 --> 00:47:53.260
marking criteria that says one of the things that

1059
00:47:53.260 --> 00:47:55.989
you're assessed against in your essay is your use

1060
00:47:55.989 --> 00:47:58.229
of evidence. And you think, OK, well I can

1061
00:47:58.229 --> 00:48:00.949
recall use of evidence, that's really important, therefore, you

1062
00:48:00.949 --> 00:48:03.689
know, I've got it. But do you know what

1063
00:48:03.689 --> 00:48:06.270
a a a good exemplar of using evidence looks

1064
00:48:06.270 --> 00:48:09.189
like? Um, COULD you recognize that in a piece

1065
00:48:09.189 --> 00:48:11.590
of work? Could you compare your own work to

1066
00:48:11.590 --> 00:48:13.629
that good exemplar and, and figure out if you've

1067
00:48:13.629 --> 00:48:15.340
done it right. If you've done it wrong. If

1068
00:48:15.340 --> 00:48:17.169
you've done it wrong, could you use the good

1069
00:48:17.169 --> 00:48:19.969
exemplar as a way of improving your practice? These

1070
00:48:19.969 --> 00:48:22.489
are all questions you should be asking yourself when

1071
00:48:22.489 --> 00:48:24.969
it comes to determining whether you really understand what

1072
00:48:24.969 --> 00:48:27.810
the expectations are, as opposed to whether you can

1073
00:48:27.810 --> 00:48:29.889
just repeat them, as it were, because you know

1074
00:48:29.889 --> 00:48:32.679
what the criteria is. Um, SO that's the first

1075
00:48:32.679 --> 00:48:34.330
thing that students go wrong. I, I try and

1076
00:48:34.330 --> 00:48:37.000
address that in the, um, in that chapter on

1077
00:48:37.010 --> 00:48:39.889
on producing assessments in my book. The other thing

1078
00:48:39.939 --> 00:48:42.540
that that students need to know about um is

1079
00:48:42.540 --> 00:48:44.620
that the one thing that students go wrong with

1080
00:48:44.620 --> 00:48:48.689
across the board is they'll often prioritize what's kind

1081
00:48:48.689 --> 00:48:52.300
of um expedience over what's relevant. And what I

1082
00:48:52.300 --> 00:48:54.060
mean by that, particularly in in the days of

1083
00:48:54.060 --> 00:48:56.739
Google searches, is that people will, you know, they'll

1084
00:48:56.739 --> 00:48:59.199
they'll Google the topic of their essay. And then

1085
00:48:59.199 --> 00:49:01.080
they'll end up with um a, you know, a

1086
00:49:01.080 --> 00:49:03.840
list of of returns from Google, and they'll they'll

1087
00:49:03.840 --> 00:49:05.879
they'll go to one of the top rated returns

1088
00:49:05.879 --> 00:49:09.959
basically. Without thinking about that, the Google hasn't evaluated

1089
00:49:09.959 --> 00:49:12.959
your request with how suitable it is for your

1090
00:49:12.959 --> 00:49:15.199
essay, it's just giving you a list of what

1091
00:49:15.199 --> 00:49:17.719
the most popular returns are, what's the most searched

1092
00:49:17.719 --> 00:49:19.280
or what, what people end up on the most,

1093
00:49:19.360 --> 00:49:20.959
which is why you always end up with Wikipedia

1094
00:49:20.959 --> 00:49:24.399
and things like that. Um, SO what you tend

1095
00:49:24.399 --> 00:49:26.199
to get there operating are things like, you know,

1096
00:49:26.239 --> 00:49:29.590
the availability bias. So we, we tend to reca,

1097
00:49:29.649 --> 00:49:31.179
we tend to use things in our essays that

1098
00:49:31.179 --> 00:49:33.919
are just easy and ready to recall, rather than

1099
00:49:33.919 --> 00:49:36.560
the things that are the most relevant. And that

1100
00:49:36.560 --> 00:49:39.280
kind of availability bias, you know, it's um, it's

1101
00:49:39.280 --> 00:49:42.540
compounded by the algorithms that are used online because

1102
00:49:42.540 --> 00:49:44.679
what it's effectively doing is sort of shoving something

1103
00:49:44.679 --> 00:49:48.030
under our nose that's popular. Um, AND we then

1104
00:49:48.030 --> 00:49:49.909
use it because we haven't really thought beyond the

1105
00:49:49.909 --> 00:49:52.659
fact, well this is popular, but is it optimal

1106
00:49:52.659 --> 00:49:54.949
for answering the particular essay question that had been

1107
00:49:54.949 --> 00:49:58.070
said? So that's kind of an indication of where

1108
00:49:58.070 --> 00:49:59.510
students go wrong there. It's kind of called it

1109
00:49:59.510 --> 00:50:03.979
expediency based practice. So rather than evaluating contents for

1110
00:50:03.979 --> 00:50:06.889
their their worth in terms of the, the assessment

1111
00:50:06.889 --> 00:50:09.149
concerned, they just tend to go for the things

1112
00:50:09.149 --> 00:50:12.179
that are most available. Um, THE other thing which

1113
00:50:12.179 --> 00:50:15.219
is always interesting is if you ask students who

1114
00:50:15.219 --> 00:50:17.659
they're writing for, and they'll often tell you, well,

1115
00:50:17.760 --> 00:50:20.540
I, I'm writing for my tutor, obviously. And of

1116
00:50:20.540 --> 00:50:22.979
course, in, in a practical way they are because

1117
00:50:22.979 --> 00:50:25.330
the tutor is the person that marks their work.

1118
00:50:25.620 --> 00:50:27.780
But in a very real way, what they're demonstrating

1119
00:50:27.780 --> 00:50:30.739
there is vulnerability is something called the curse of

1120
00:50:30.739 --> 00:50:34.610
knowledge, because if you're writing for a tutor. What's

1121
00:50:34.610 --> 00:50:36.810
probably gonna happen are two things. One is at

1122
00:50:36.810 --> 00:50:38.899
that point you would probably have studied that material,

1123
00:50:38.929 --> 00:50:41.570
and the, the dangerous thing is once we've studied

1124
00:50:41.570 --> 00:50:43.320
something, we tend to look back at that knowledge

1125
00:50:43.320 --> 00:50:45.750
as much more obvious as it is. That's kind

1126
00:50:45.750 --> 00:50:48.629
of, you know, the hindsight bias, basically. Um, ONCE

1127
00:50:48.629 --> 00:50:50.350
we know something, we can't unknow it, and it

1128
00:50:50.350 --> 00:50:53.219
just seems more obvious. That's why when you're watching

1129
00:50:53.219 --> 00:50:55.889
a game show sometimes, and a contestant is on

1130
00:50:55.889 --> 00:50:57.310
there and they get a question that you know

1131
00:50:57.310 --> 00:50:59.669
the answer to, and the contestants I'm in and

1132
00:50:59.669 --> 00:51:01.989
ah in, um, you tend to get really annoyed

1133
00:51:01.989 --> 00:51:04.709
and start shouting at the TV. Um, IT'S because

1134
00:51:04.709 --> 00:51:06.875
you can't break free of your own. YOU know

1135
00:51:06.875 --> 00:51:09.054
it, so it's obvious to you, um, but the

1136
00:51:09.054 --> 00:51:12.274
poor contestant doesn't share your knowledge, um, and you

1137
00:51:12.274 --> 00:51:14.594
can't see that, um, and that's where the kind

1138
00:51:14.594 --> 00:51:16.635
of curse of knowledge comes in. You can't, we

1139
00:51:16.635 --> 00:51:18.354
tend to assume that people at the same level

1140
00:51:18.354 --> 00:51:20.435
of understanding that we are. Now the problem for

1141
00:51:20.435 --> 00:51:23.034
this when you're writing an essay, is that if

1142
00:51:23.034 --> 00:51:25.915
you think something is obvious, how likely are you

1143
00:51:25.915 --> 00:51:29.155
to explain it in the essay? Probably not likely.

1144
00:51:29.590 --> 00:51:31.439
If you know, if you think that the person

1145
00:51:31.439 --> 00:51:33.520
you're writing for, or the level you're pitching your

1146
00:51:33.520 --> 00:51:36.439
essay at or your assignment at is for someone

1147
00:51:36.439 --> 00:51:38.989
who you've perceived to be an expert, how much

1148
00:51:38.989 --> 00:51:41.159
of the knowledge you should be demonstrating in your

1149
00:51:41.159 --> 00:51:43.929
work are you gonna gloss over the fear of,

1150
00:51:43.959 --> 00:51:47.270
you know, patronizing the person you're writing for? So

1151
00:51:47.479 --> 00:51:49.840
that idea of the hindsight bias and the curse

1152
00:51:49.840 --> 00:51:52.280
of knowledge and knowing about these things and their

1153
00:51:52.280 --> 00:51:55.360
implications for the way you produce written work is

1154
00:51:55.360 --> 00:51:58.120
kind of really important. Um, AND the last thing

1155
00:51:58.120 --> 00:52:00.100
really, it's one of the things that, that ruins

1156
00:52:00.100 --> 00:52:03.020
many an essay or assignment, um, it is, is

1157
00:52:03.020 --> 00:52:04.860
a product of what we call the guru effect,

1158
00:52:05.179 --> 00:52:06.939
which is that we, we tend to assume that

1159
00:52:06.939 --> 00:52:10.459
things that are difficult to understand must be inherently

1160
00:52:10.459 --> 00:52:14.459
profound in some way or wise, um, uh, regardless

1161
00:52:14.459 --> 00:52:16.530
of if it actually makes any sense or not.

1162
00:52:16.899 --> 00:52:19.100
Um, AND there was a wonderful study about this

1163
00:52:19.100 --> 00:52:22.659
actually, that, um, that again used undergraduate students, psychology

1164
00:52:22.659 --> 00:52:26.260
undergraduate students, if memory serves correctly. And they gave

1165
00:52:26.260 --> 00:52:29.179
them a series of statements, and the statements were

1166
00:52:29.179 --> 00:52:32.169
manipulated for um whether they were profound or not.

1167
00:52:32.300 --> 00:52:34.899
So some of the statements were um things that

1168
00:52:34.899 --> 00:52:38.020
were just mundane, mundane but true, like, you know,

1169
00:52:38.179 --> 00:52:41.290
newborn babies require constant attention, you know, well done,

1170
00:52:41.419 --> 00:52:44.340
but yes, it's true. Um, AND another thing might

1171
00:52:44.340 --> 00:52:48.070
be, um, something that's, that's also true, but stated

1172
00:52:48.070 --> 00:52:50.739
a little bit more, um, a little bit less

1173
00:52:50.739 --> 00:52:53.300
directly. So a wet person does not fear the

1174
00:52:53.300 --> 00:52:55.899
white of the rain. So that's kind of a

1175
00:52:55.899 --> 00:52:57.780
degree of profundity in that knowledge. There's a little

1176
00:52:57.780 --> 00:52:59.580
of truth to it, it does make sense, but

1177
00:52:59.580 --> 00:53:02.830
it's been articulated in a less direct way. And

1178
00:53:02.830 --> 00:53:04.909
then, um, a third group of statements were just

1179
00:53:04.909 --> 00:53:07.419
sort of sway over profound bullshit that had been

1180
00:53:07.419 --> 00:53:11.629
generated from a site, um, that basically just uses

1181
00:53:11.629 --> 00:53:14.310
long words and scramble them up and, and makes

1182
00:53:14.310 --> 00:53:16.750
it so it sounds good. So an example would

1183
00:53:16.750 --> 00:53:20.540
be something like, um, wholeness quiets in the phenomena,

1184
00:53:20.909 --> 00:53:23.429
which, which sounds amazing, but actually is complete gibberish,

1185
00:53:23.469 --> 00:53:25.870
doesn't actually mean anything. And of course what you'd

1186
00:53:25.870 --> 00:53:28.030
hope is that the, you know, the intelligent and

1187
00:53:28.030 --> 00:53:31.219
diligent undergraduate students would be able to distinguish between

1188
00:53:31.469 --> 00:53:33.860
the, the profound, you know, sway over profound bullshit,

1189
00:53:34.070 --> 00:53:37.820
uh, profound statements and just mundane but true statements.

1190
00:53:38.199 --> 00:53:39.780
Uh, AND what they had found in this study

1191
00:53:39.780 --> 00:53:42.750
is that students would often rate the suede profound

1192
00:53:42.750 --> 00:53:46.429
bullshit statements as being profound. Um, SO again, it's

1193
00:53:46.429 --> 00:53:48.709
just that thing of when sometimes when things sound

1194
00:53:48.709 --> 00:53:51.663
complicated. Or sound sophisticated, we just tend to buy

1195
00:53:51.663 --> 00:53:54.302
into them without being critical. And the reason that

1196
00:53:54.302 --> 00:53:56.423
tends to be a problem in essays, and we've

1197
00:53:56.423 --> 00:53:59.202
all looked at articles online before and thought, my

1198
00:53:59.202 --> 00:54:01.212
God, is this person swallowed a theosaurus or something,

1199
00:54:01.262 --> 00:54:03.012
cos I don't understand a blooming word of this.

1200
00:54:03.302 --> 00:54:06.022
Um, BUT some people think that that's the way

1201
00:54:06.022 --> 00:54:08.572
to try and sound clever, that if you do

1202
00:54:08.572 --> 00:54:11.083
that when you're writing an essay, that the tutor

1203
00:54:11.083 --> 00:54:14.055
will be so impressed with your use of. Necessarily

1204
00:54:14.055 --> 00:54:17.375
complicated and sophisticated terminology, um they'll give you a

1205
00:54:17.375 --> 00:54:20.216
good mark, when actually research suggests that the opposite

1206
00:54:20.216 --> 00:54:23.016
is the case. Um, uh, THE thing, the thing

1207
00:54:23.016 --> 00:54:25.375
I always say to students is when you're writing

1208
00:54:25.375 --> 00:54:28.176
as an academic, regardless of some of the appalling

1209
00:54:28.176 --> 00:54:31.246
examples you see out there, always go for simplicity,

1210
00:54:31.496 --> 00:54:35.355
um, you know, always price simplicity and conciseness and

1211
00:54:35.355 --> 00:54:38.949
clarity over trying to sound good. So right there,

1212
00:54:38.969 --> 00:54:42.570
there's, there's kind of 4 psychological effects if you

1213
00:54:42.570 --> 00:54:45.330
like, or 4 biases and things like that, that

1214
00:54:45.330 --> 00:54:48.689
can really um interfere and undermine your writing that

1215
00:54:48.689 --> 00:54:51.050
I cover in that chapter, just to try and

1216
00:54:51.050 --> 00:54:53.689
warn students off them and try and improve their

1217
00:54:53.689 --> 00:54:55.889
writing at a stroke, um, regardless of, you know,

1218
00:54:55.969 --> 00:54:57.810
what type of assessment it is or or what

1219
00:54:57.810 --> 00:54:58.840
subject they're studying.

1220
00:54:59.899 --> 00:55:02.679
And of course, something that people have to do

1221
00:55:02.679 --> 00:55:05.520
in academia, not only as students, but then also

1222
00:55:05.520 --> 00:55:08.139
if they land an academic job of some kind

1223
00:55:08.139 --> 00:55:11.070
like a researcher, a professor, is that they have

1224
00:55:11.070 --> 00:55:14.959
to work collaboratively. But there are some challenges that

1225
00:55:14.959 --> 00:55:17.120
come with that. What would you say are perhaps

1226
00:55:17.120 --> 00:55:21.040
some of the biggest challenges and again, how do

1227
00:55:21.040 --> 00:55:24.310
they connect to effective studying?

1228
00:55:24.729 --> 00:55:27.639
Yeah, um, absolutely. I mean, it's one of those

1229
00:55:27.639 --> 00:55:30.010
things that's always perennially at the, the top of,

1230
00:55:30.020 --> 00:55:32.560
um, uh, you know, employers' wish list, isn't it,

1231
00:55:32.570 --> 00:55:34.260
the ability to work in a team and things

1232
00:55:34.260 --> 00:55:37.370
like that. So the challenges of working collaboratively in

1233
00:55:37.370 --> 00:55:40.260
academia are really no different than than working collaborativeatively

1234
00:55:40.260 --> 00:55:43.449
in any context, which is the, the problem is

1235
00:55:43.449 --> 00:55:47.110
that humans aren't as well geared up towards working

1236
00:55:47.110 --> 00:55:50.649
collaboratively as we like to think. Um, AND if

1237
00:55:50.649 --> 00:55:53.250
I. If I talk about the service social loafing

1238
00:55:53.250 --> 00:55:55.770
now, that will probably ring some bells and, and

1239
00:55:55.770 --> 00:55:58.810
all it really means is the more people you

1240
00:55:58.810 --> 00:56:01.969
put on a task, um, the less each of

1241
00:56:01.969 --> 00:56:05.090
those individuals involved in that task will contribute towards

1242
00:56:05.090 --> 00:56:08.149
the group, the the group goal. Um, SO their

1243
00:56:08.159 --> 00:56:11.389
individual effort will diminish the larger the group gets.

1244
00:56:11.560 --> 00:56:14.320
And this is probably due to something we'd, we'd

1245
00:56:14.320 --> 00:56:16.280
call sort of, you know, diffusion of responsibility, which

1246
00:56:16.280 --> 00:56:18.840
is that everyone starts to assume that someone else

1247
00:56:18.840 --> 00:56:21.040
will do it, um, as it were. But it's

1248
00:56:21.040 --> 00:56:25.100
also because people feel more anonymous in larger groups.

1249
00:56:25.239 --> 00:56:27.679
They feel less accountable for the work that they're

1250
00:56:27.679 --> 00:56:31.689
doing. Um, AND when people don't feel accountable, um,

1251
00:56:31.790 --> 00:56:33.540
they tend to put in less effort, basically. When

1252
00:56:33.540 --> 00:56:35.350
you know that you're gonna be held to account

1253
00:56:35.350 --> 00:56:37.510
for your efforts, um, you know, you, you generally

1254
00:56:37.510 --> 00:56:39.469
get on with it. But if you think you

1255
00:56:39.469 --> 00:56:41.629
can hide behind the group as a whole, you're

1256
00:56:41.629 --> 00:56:43.229
less inclined to kind of put the effort in.

1257
00:56:43.270 --> 00:56:45.429
And there's lots of research for about the last

1258
00:56:45.429 --> 00:56:47.590
50 or so years in, in social psychology to

1259
00:56:47.590 --> 00:56:51.090
that effect. Um, THE way around this, as, as

1260
00:56:51.090 --> 00:56:53.929
you might guess, is to try and increase the

1261
00:56:53.929 --> 00:56:57.800
accountability of each of the individual group members. Um,

1262
00:56:57.969 --> 00:57:00.560
SO one of the ways you can do that

1263
00:57:00.560 --> 00:57:02.770
is to have, like, peer evaluation, and you might

1264
00:57:02.770 --> 00:57:06.169
have seen this on, uh, on some assessments if

1265
00:57:06.169 --> 00:57:07.810
you, if you work in university or you are

1266
00:57:07.810 --> 00:57:10.729
a student, where each of the the group members

1267
00:57:10.729 --> 00:57:14.129
gets to rate the performance of other group members,

1268
00:57:14.290 --> 00:57:16.209
but throughout the task, not just at the end

1269
00:57:16.209 --> 00:57:18.080
of the task, cos it's. It's a bit late

1270
00:57:18.080 --> 00:57:19.919
to call someone, you know, good for nothing slacker

1271
00:57:19.919 --> 00:57:21.600
at the end of the task, cause it's done

1272
00:57:21.600 --> 00:57:23.840
and dusted then. Um, NOT that you should really

1273
00:57:23.840 --> 00:57:25.469
do that at any point in the task, but,

1274
00:57:25.679 --> 00:57:28.870
um, the evaluation should occur throughout the task. So,

1275
00:57:29.000 --> 00:57:30.520
cos it's then fair to someone, if they, if

1276
00:57:30.520 --> 00:57:32.239
they can then see that the group doesn't feel

1277
00:57:32.239 --> 00:57:34.159
like they're pulling their weight, they can elect to

1278
00:57:34.159 --> 00:57:36.739
do something about it. Um, AND it does sound

1279
00:57:36.739 --> 00:57:38.629
like a recipe for sort of pistols at dawn

1280
00:57:38.629 --> 00:57:40.870
in some ways. But if as a group you

1281
00:57:40.870 --> 00:57:43.020
can agree on the ground rules from the outset,

1282
00:57:43.340 --> 00:57:45.469
um, and you can agree on the criteria under

1283
00:57:45.469 --> 00:57:47.229
which people will be judged against in terms of

1284
00:57:47.229 --> 00:57:49.669
pulling their own weight, then it's actually a really

1285
00:57:49.669 --> 00:57:53.379
useful, um, thing to do, because often the, um,

1286
00:57:53.389 --> 00:57:55.870
the threat, for want of a better term, of

1287
00:57:55.870 --> 00:57:58.429
someone being kind of exposed as the person who's

1288
00:57:58.429 --> 00:58:01.629
letting the side down, um, in an environment is

1289
00:58:01.629 --> 00:58:03.909
enough to get people back on track and doing

1290
00:58:03.909 --> 00:58:06.969
their bit, as it were. So I, I think

1291
00:58:07.330 --> 00:58:10.239
that's the main challenge of working collaboratively in academia.

1292
00:58:10.489 --> 00:58:13.010
When you get group work tasks where it is

1293
00:58:13.010 --> 00:58:15.790
a collaborative effort and there isn't an individually assessed

1294
00:58:15.790 --> 00:58:19.810
component, you have to contrived ways of making sure

1295
00:58:19.810 --> 00:58:23.250
that each individual member of that group feels accountable

1296
00:58:23.250 --> 00:58:25.969
for their contribution. And I think that can be

1297
00:58:25.969 --> 00:58:28.610
quite difficult, but peer evaluation is probably a, a

1298
00:58:28.610 --> 00:58:30.169
kind of good way of going about it.

1299
00:58:31.300 --> 00:58:33.760
So, I have one more topic I would like

1300
00:58:33.760 --> 00:58:35.479
to ask you about, and then I have just

1301
00:58:35.479 --> 00:58:38.479
a final question that comes from a patron of

1302
00:58:38.479 --> 00:58:44.050
the show. So, the last topic is about presentations

1303
00:58:44.050 --> 00:58:46.889
and slide shows. I mean, of course, not all

1304
00:58:46.889 --> 00:58:51.040
presentations, not in all presentations, people. USE slide shows,

1305
00:58:51.080 --> 00:58:53.040
but in many of them, they use, they use

1306
00:58:53.040 --> 00:58:55.689
them nowadays. But what would you say are perhaps

1307
00:58:55.689 --> 00:59:00.919
the most common mistakes people make in presentations? And

1308
00:59:00.919 --> 00:59:04.520
what would you say are the most important ideas

1309
00:59:04.520 --> 00:59:07.949
for them to keep in mind when preparing a

1310
00:59:07.949 --> 00:59:08.520
presentation?

1311
00:59:09.169 --> 00:59:11.399
Yeah, well, I mean that that last point you

1312
00:59:11.399 --> 00:59:13.040
made there I think is, is the, the thing

1313
00:59:13.040 --> 00:59:16.439
you start with, because if you start with the

1314
00:59:16.439 --> 00:59:20.070
um, the understanding that in producing a presentation, your

1315
00:59:20.070 --> 00:59:23.229
goal is to make things easier for the audience

1316
00:59:23.229 --> 00:59:26.699
and not for yourself as a presenter. Then the

1317
00:59:26.699 --> 00:59:30.370
good practice will tend to spring naturally from that.

1318
00:59:30.580 --> 00:59:32.020
A lot of the mistakes you tend to get

1319
00:59:32.020 --> 00:59:34.739
people making when it comes to presentations are born

1320
00:59:34.739 --> 00:59:37.060
of the fact that they're nervous. You know, that

1321
00:59:37.060 --> 00:59:39.979
they're they're, they, they're not particularly confident, um, and

1322
00:59:39.979 --> 00:59:41.780
what they tend to do then is adjust the

1323
00:59:41.780 --> 00:59:44.629
nature of their presentation. So that they, um, their

1324
00:59:44.629 --> 00:59:47.439
slides, for example, become a crutch for them. So

1325
00:59:47.439 --> 00:59:49.199
if you've ever seen a slide and it's contained

1326
00:59:49.199 --> 00:59:51.159
about, you know, a mini essay on what, you

1327
00:59:51.159 --> 00:59:55.239
know, in, in 5 point font, and someone's reading

1328
00:59:55.239 --> 00:59:57.320
from the slide, they're not probably doing that to

1329
00:59:57.320 --> 00:59:59.169
be awkward, at least I hope they're not. Um,

1330
00:59:59.179 --> 01:00:00.719
THEY'RE probably doing it because they were frightened of

1331
01:00:00.719 --> 01:00:03.360
drying up. Um, BUT in doing that, what they,

1332
01:00:03.439 --> 01:00:06.600
what they've done is they've oriented the presentation in

1333
01:00:06.600 --> 01:00:08.310
such a way that makes it easier for them.

1334
01:00:08.520 --> 01:00:10.939
And in doing that, that's kind of made the

1335
01:00:10.939 --> 01:00:14.996
presentation less. Accessible and less appealing to the audience.

1336
01:00:15.285 --> 01:00:17.125
So if you just start off, um, when you're

1337
01:00:17.125 --> 01:00:19.565
thinking about giving a presentation saying, who are my

1338
01:00:19.565 --> 01:00:21.746
audience and how can I make this as easy

1339
01:00:21.746 --> 01:00:24.206
as possible for them, even if it makes life

1340
01:00:24.206 --> 01:00:26.726
a bit more uncomfortable for me, that's a good

1341
01:00:26.726 --> 01:00:29.246
start. Now, in terms of the kind of the

1342
01:00:29.246 --> 01:00:32.446
common ills, if you like, of presentations, um, the,

1343
01:00:32.486 --> 01:00:34.605
the one thing that people, the, the three things

1344
01:00:34.605 --> 01:00:37.206
that people do most commonly, and there's some research

1345
01:00:37.206 --> 01:00:39.805
by Stephen Collin about this that looked at PowerPoint

1346
01:00:39.805 --> 01:00:42.412
errors. And, and how frequently they're made and um

1347
01:00:42.412 --> 01:00:44.852
and how annoying they are to the audience. The

1348
01:00:44.852 --> 01:00:46.291
first one is common to all of us, which

1349
01:00:46.291 --> 01:00:48.922
is PowerPoint karaoke. And it's where you get a

1350
01:00:48.922 --> 01:00:51.652
speaker up the front and they either read pretty

1351
01:00:51.652 --> 01:00:54.612
much verbatim off of their slides or, um, off

1352
01:00:54.612 --> 01:00:57.041
of their notes, basically. And of course this does

1353
01:00:57.041 --> 01:00:58.531
beg the question of, well, if all you're gonna

1354
01:00:58.531 --> 01:01:00.802
do is read off your materials, you could really

1355
01:01:00.802 --> 01:01:02.172
just have sent us some materials and we could

1356
01:01:02.172 --> 01:01:03.372
have read it in the comfort of our own

1357
01:01:03.372 --> 01:01:06.092
homes. Um, THE point of a presentation is, is

1358
01:01:06.092 --> 01:01:08.082
you have to present, you are the focus of

1359
01:01:08.082 --> 01:01:10.770
attention. Um, SO that's the, the one of the

1360
01:01:10.770 --> 01:01:12.409
most common and one of the most annoying things

1361
01:01:12.409 --> 01:01:15.360
that people do. And really to get around that,

1362
01:01:15.389 --> 01:01:18.370
you've really got to start thinking about things like

1363
01:01:18.370 --> 01:01:22.929
multimedia principles, um, of, of, of good slide design.

1364
01:01:23.250 --> 01:01:26.689
So your slides become much more talking prompts. So

1365
01:01:26.689 --> 01:01:28.729
the idea is you, you have very little in

1366
01:01:28.729 --> 01:01:31.050
the way of words on the slides, but you

1367
01:01:31.050 --> 01:01:33.239
have a phrase that you can then elaborate on.

1368
01:01:33.530 --> 01:01:35.810
Um, AND that's much better than actually putting everything

1369
01:01:35.810 --> 01:01:37.689
you want to say on the slide for obvious

1370
01:01:37.689 --> 01:01:40.879
reasons. Um, THAT kind of relates to the second

1371
01:01:40.879 --> 01:01:42.919
thing that people tend to do wrong, which is

1372
01:01:42.919 --> 01:01:47.439
they, they incorporate unnecessary content into their slide. Um,

1373
01:01:47.479 --> 01:01:50.120
SO that each slide really should have a main

1374
01:01:50.120 --> 01:01:53.239
contention or a main focus. And if you start

1375
01:01:53.239 --> 01:01:55.800
putting too much information into a slide, what happens

1376
01:01:55.800 --> 01:01:58.580
is the, the point of that particular slide becomes

1377
01:01:58.840 --> 01:02:02.239
increasingly obscure and difficult for the audience to pick

1378
01:02:02.239 --> 01:02:05.030
up on. So, uh, and sometimes it happens because

1379
01:02:05.030 --> 01:02:07.469
people are just banging loads onto the slides because

1380
01:02:07.469 --> 01:02:09.030
they just think it's a value for money thing

1381
01:02:09.030 --> 01:02:10.669
and the more information they give to the reader,

1382
01:02:10.709 --> 01:02:13.669
the better. Um, BUT really, you should make sure

1383
01:02:13.669 --> 01:02:16.070
that that each part of your presentation, each slide,

1384
01:02:16.110 --> 01:02:18.000
however you want to break it up, has a

1385
01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:21.250
specific point, and that the only information you include,

1386
01:02:21.469 --> 01:02:24.919
um, is information that is relevant to perhaps substantiating

1387
01:02:24.919 --> 01:02:27.870
that point or to talking around that point. Um,

1388
01:02:27.939 --> 01:02:30.620
AND the other, the other mistake people often make

1389
01:02:30.620 --> 01:02:33.020
as well, which again is, is very highly related

1390
01:02:33.020 --> 01:02:35.959
to the first two. Is they just put too

1391
01:02:35.959 --> 01:02:39.040
much information on a slide to absorb, and it

1392
01:02:39.040 --> 01:02:41.760
might be relevant information, it might be, um, the

1393
01:02:41.760 --> 01:02:43.760
fact that they've used lots of bullet points, for

1394
01:02:43.760 --> 01:02:45.439
example, so it's not that they've tried to script

1395
01:02:45.439 --> 01:02:48.510
the entire presentation, but they've used like, you know,

1396
01:02:48.639 --> 01:02:52.050
20 bullet points, or they've used this horrendous diagram

1397
01:02:52.050 --> 01:02:54.570
with about 3 different sectors of sort of spider

1398
01:02:54.570 --> 01:02:56.919
web diagrams, and you just don't know where to

1399
01:02:56.919 --> 01:03:00.080
look first, your attention is completely overwhelmed. Uh, AND

1400
01:03:00.080 --> 01:03:01.719
you have to bear in mind that a big

1401
01:03:01.719 --> 01:03:03.479
part of your duty as a presenter is to

1402
01:03:03.479 --> 01:03:06.280
manage the cognitive load of the audience. You, you

1403
01:03:06.280 --> 01:03:08.280
don't want to give them so much information to

1404
01:03:08.280 --> 01:03:11.239
deal with that their short-term memory just goes. Sorry,

1405
01:03:11.320 --> 01:03:13.000
but too much, cos what happens then is they'll

1406
01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:16.760
just get bored and switch off. So whenever you're

1407
01:03:16.760 --> 01:03:19.479
thinking about slide and slide design, you really want

1408
01:03:19.479 --> 01:03:22.229
to limit the number of items on that slide

1409
01:03:22.560 --> 01:03:24.639
to, you know, let, let's say you, I would

1410
01:03:24.639 --> 01:03:26.469
say a good rule of thumb is sort of

1411
01:03:26.469 --> 01:03:28.639
no, no more than 5 really, cos I think

1412
01:03:28.639 --> 01:03:30.479
once you go beyond that, you're just putting too

1413
01:03:30.479 --> 01:03:33.360
much strain on people's working memory and it becomes

1414
01:03:33.360 --> 01:03:35.229
quite a chore for them to take that information

1415
01:03:35.229 --> 01:03:37.600
in and to retainer the parts of the slide

1416
01:03:37.600 --> 01:03:40.209
that are necessary. So, um, so those are the

1417
01:03:40.209 --> 01:03:42.229
three mistakes basically, and they are kind of quite

1418
01:03:42.229 --> 01:03:44.889
highly related. Um, BUT they all tend to come

1419
01:03:44.889 --> 01:03:47.129
from people being just, you know, they're not from

1420
01:03:47.129 --> 01:03:50.409
ill will or, um, sometimes they even ignorance, and

1421
01:03:50.409 --> 01:03:52.530
this is the interesting thing about the research that

1422
01:03:52.530 --> 01:03:55.879
Stephen Colson did. It's that sometimes people can recognize

1423
01:03:55.879 --> 01:03:58.290
errors in other presentations, but they go on to

1424
01:03:58.290 --> 01:04:00.719
make the same errors themselves in their own presentations.

1425
01:04:01.090 --> 01:04:03.120
And that probably is due to the fact that

1426
01:04:03.370 --> 01:04:05.239
it's one thing to know what an error is,

1427
01:04:05.570 --> 01:04:08.370
but that those errors are born from just being

1428
01:04:08.370 --> 01:04:11.489
a nervous presenter and designing slides for your benefit

1429
01:04:11.489 --> 01:04:12.929
rather than the audience's benefit.

1430
01:04:14.560 --> 01:04:18.360
So, let's then address the question from my patron,

1431
01:04:18.439 --> 01:04:23.120
Bernard Seyche. He asks, um, does going to college

1432
01:04:23.120 --> 01:04:27.479
make a big difference in a person's intelligence and

1433
01:04:27.479 --> 01:04:28.639
professional skills?

1434
01:04:30.090 --> 01:04:32.580
Um, WELL, it, it's, it would be a blanket

1435
01:04:32.580 --> 01:04:33.709
answer for me to say yes or no there,

1436
01:04:33.790 --> 01:04:37.010
wouldn't it, really? I, I think, particularly in, in,

1437
01:04:37.030 --> 01:04:39.590
in today's age, you, you need to be, you

1438
01:04:39.590 --> 01:04:41.350
need to be sure about why you're going to

1439
01:04:41.350 --> 01:04:44.310
college and, and what you want to get out

1440
01:04:44.310 --> 01:04:48.270
of it and how college figures in your overall

1441
01:04:48.270 --> 01:04:51.189
career plan. So I think one of the things

1442
01:04:51.189 --> 01:04:53.489
that I try and discourage students from doing is,

1443
01:04:53.629 --> 01:04:55.500
is going to college for the sake of it.

1444
01:04:56.050 --> 01:04:58.500
Um, YOU know, because they think that's what needs

1445
01:04:58.500 --> 01:05:00.929
to be done, or that's just what you have

1446
01:05:00.929 --> 01:05:02.580
to do to get any kind of half decent

1447
01:05:02.580 --> 01:05:05.260
job and things like that. Um, AND the reason

1448
01:05:05.260 --> 01:05:08.120
I discourage that is because if you really have

1449
01:05:08.120 --> 01:05:11.379
no interest in what you're studying, then you are

1450
01:05:11.379 --> 01:05:13.770
not going to be inclined to use some of

1451
01:05:13.770 --> 01:05:17.020
the, the more effective but more effortful methods of

1452
01:05:17.020 --> 01:05:20.540
studying that will produce the best results. Because the

1453
01:05:20.540 --> 01:05:22.120
one thing you really can't do if you, if

1454
01:05:22.120 --> 01:05:24.300
you want to get a, a good result um

1455
01:05:24.300 --> 01:05:26.459
out of a degree is to just kind of

1456
01:05:26.459 --> 01:05:28.530
phone it in, uh, just to do lots of

1457
01:05:28.530 --> 01:05:31.300
re-reading, lots of, you know, taking notes, verbatim, you

1458
01:05:31.300 --> 01:05:33.840
know, cramming for exams at the last minute. It's

1459
01:05:33.840 --> 01:05:36.020
gonna be a really unpleasant experience for you and

1460
01:05:36.020 --> 01:05:37.899
you just, you know, it's not really adding anything

1461
01:05:37.899 --> 01:05:39.820
to your life. So I think the first thing

1462
01:05:39.820 --> 01:05:42.780
is to understand how the course you're thinking of

1463
01:05:42.780 --> 01:05:45.979
studying is going to equip you, um, for the

1464
01:05:45.979 --> 01:05:48.810
future ahead. I think the the key thing is

1465
01:05:48.810 --> 01:05:51.760
to study what you're interested in, um, because there

1466
01:05:51.760 --> 01:05:55.409
are, if you engage with learning properly, there are

1467
01:05:55.409 --> 01:05:58.090
transferable things that we've been talking about through, you

1468
01:05:58.090 --> 01:06:00.770
know, through this, this show so far. Things like

1469
01:06:00.770 --> 01:06:04.169
teamwork, things like how to interrogate information, things like

1470
01:06:04.169 --> 01:06:07.050
how to become an ethical practitioner, things like how

1471
01:06:07.050 --> 01:06:10.129
to communicate clearly, that if you really engage with

1472
01:06:10.129 --> 01:06:13.560
studying effectively, um, these things will start to develop

1473
01:06:13.560 --> 01:06:16.850
irrespective of what subject you're taking. So there are

1474
01:06:16.850 --> 01:06:18.919
things to be gained from doing a degree across

1475
01:06:18.919 --> 01:06:21.090
the board, but I think the key thing is

1476
01:06:21.090 --> 01:06:22.770
to make sure that you're studying something that you

1477
01:06:22.770 --> 01:06:25.169
have an interest in, because that's what will, will

1478
01:06:25.169 --> 01:06:28.729
motivate you to, to invest time and effort in

1479
01:06:28.729 --> 01:06:30.530
the kind of the, the, the, you know, the

1480
01:06:30.530 --> 01:06:34.030
things that require, Um, effortful contributions, in other words,

1481
01:06:34.080 --> 01:06:37.229
the methods of studying that will, will challenge you,

1482
01:06:37.270 --> 01:06:38.949
will present you with the fact that you're not

1483
01:06:38.949 --> 01:06:41.709
getting it right immediately, um, and require you to

1484
01:06:41.709 --> 01:06:44.629
persist. And it's whether you're interested in what you're

1485
01:06:44.629 --> 01:06:46.030
learning or not, I think that is a big

1486
01:06:46.030 --> 01:06:49.040
determinant of that. So I think those are the

1487
01:06:49.040 --> 01:06:51.050
things that I that I would always encourage. So

1488
01:06:51.320 --> 01:06:53.989
is it worth it? Um, IT certainly can be,

1489
01:06:54.320 --> 01:06:57.040
um, but I think you need to understand, um,

1490
01:06:57.199 --> 01:06:59.600
what you're studying, how it kind of fits in

1491
01:06:59.600 --> 01:07:01.560
with what you want to do when you leave

1492
01:07:01.560 --> 01:07:04.280
college, and you need to engage with something that

1493
01:07:04.280 --> 01:07:07.274
you're really into. Enthusiastic about, so you can use

1494
01:07:07.274 --> 01:07:10.215
methods of studying that will, will challenge you and

1495
01:07:10.215 --> 01:07:12.655
will get the results that you want rather than

1496
01:07:12.655 --> 01:07:14.074
just kind of phone it in for the entire

1497
01:07:14.074 --> 01:07:16.504
3 years and end up with a fairly mediocre

1498
01:07:16.504 --> 01:07:19.935
degree, or, or God forbid a foul. Um, AND,

1499
01:07:19.975 --> 01:07:21.854
and it'll be a really unpleasant experience for you

1500
01:07:21.854 --> 01:07:22.364
as well.

1501
01:07:23.800 --> 01:07:26.760
Great. So, the book is again the psychology of

1502
01:07:26.760 --> 01:07:30.169
effective studying how to succeed in your degree. I'm

1503
01:07:30.169 --> 01:07:31.989
of course leaving a link to it in the

1504
01:07:31.989 --> 01:07:35.090
description of the interview and Doctor Pen, apart from

1505
01:07:35.090 --> 01:07:37.649
the book, would you like to let people know

1506
01:07:37.649 --> 01:07:39.800
where they can find you and the rest of

1507
01:07:39.800 --> 01:07:41.129
your work on the internet?

1508
01:07:41.739 --> 01:07:44.169
Yeah, certainly. Um, WELL, I mean, it, apart from

1509
01:07:44.169 --> 01:07:47.469
the book, I also have a YouTube channel. Um,

1510
01:07:47.489 --> 01:07:51.290
AND that contains, uh, advice on studying. Um, FOR

1511
01:07:51.290 --> 01:07:53.350
those of you that study psychology, it also has

1512
01:07:53.350 --> 01:07:56.090
guides to producing things like, you know, uh, lab

1513
01:07:56.090 --> 01:07:58.530
reports. Um, FOR those of you that don't study

1514
01:07:58.530 --> 01:08:00.489
psychology, it has lots of advice on how to

1515
01:08:00.489 --> 01:08:04.290
produce essays, uh, effectively from psychology. And it talks

1516
01:08:04.290 --> 01:08:05.969
about a lot of the things that we've been

1517
01:08:05.969 --> 01:08:08.530
discussing here about how to approach things like reading

1518
01:08:08.530 --> 01:08:10.784
and notes. Taking what you need to understand about

1519
01:08:10.784 --> 01:08:14.534
academic integrity. Um, BUT the channel was recently, uh,

1520
01:08:14.544 --> 01:08:19.334
expanded, um, to cover the applications of psychology beyond

1521
01:08:19.334 --> 01:08:21.904
just studying. So now I'm starting to talk about

1522
01:08:21.904 --> 01:08:24.305
things like, you know, why are people trolling, for

1523
01:08:24.305 --> 01:08:27.104
example, what motivates people to troll? How do, what

1524
01:08:27.104 --> 01:08:29.544
kind of strategies or psychology do shops use when

1525
01:08:29.544 --> 01:08:31.145
they're trying to persuade you to buy things in

1526
01:08:31.145 --> 01:08:33.944
the sale? How can you become more assertive and

1527
01:08:33.944 --> 01:08:37.520
say no without feeling bad about it? Um, I've

1528
01:08:37.520 --> 01:08:38.879
got one at the moment where I'm looking at

1529
01:08:38.879 --> 01:08:41.240
sort of, you know, bedtime procrastination and things like

1530
01:08:41.240 --> 01:08:43.950
that. So the channel now is called, uh, Presenting

1531
01:08:43.950 --> 01:08:47.419
Psychology. Um, SO, uh, and, and it, it really,

1532
01:08:47.479 --> 01:08:50.040
it encompasses both the studying material. So there's a

1533
01:08:50.040 --> 01:08:52.560
section for students, a playlist for students that contains

1534
01:08:52.560 --> 01:08:54.560
all the kind of videos we've talked about. But

1535
01:08:54.560 --> 01:08:56.959
there's also a section for everybody, people that are

1536
01:08:56.959 --> 01:08:59.950
just interested in the application of psychology and the

1537
01:08:59.950 --> 01:09:02.160
way it could perhaps just enhance their lives across

1538
01:09:02.160 --> 01:09:04.220
the board, um, as opposed to just make them

1539
01:09:04.220 --> 01:09:07.120
more effective learners. Um, THERE'S, there's lots of videos

1540
01:09:07.120 --> 01:09:09.879
on interesting subjects that have been submitted and, and

1541
01:09:09.879 --> 01:09:11.589
will be submitted in the future there too.

1542
01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:15.649
