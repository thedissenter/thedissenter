00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:03.210
Hello everyone. Welcome to a new episode of The

2
00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:06.409
Dissenter. I'm your host, Ricardo Lops, and today I'm

3
00:00:06.409 --> 00:00:10.329
joined by Doctor Eric Storm. He is associate professor

4
00:00:10.329 --> 00:00:14.529
of history at Leiden University, and today we're talking

5
00:00:14.529 --> 00:00:19.370
about his book, Nationalism, A World History. So, Doctor

6
00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:21.770
Storm, welcome to the show. It's a pleasure to

7
00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:21.930
everyone.

8
00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:24.479
Well, thank you for having me.

9
00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:29.500
So what motivated you to write a book on

10
00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:32.180
the world history of nationalism?

11
00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:36.220
So, first of all, because there was no such

12
00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:40.419
book, so most uh studies on nationalism focus on

13
00:00:40.419 --> 00:00:45.130
one country or maybe nationalism in Europe or in

14
00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:49.740
Latin America uh or in Africa, but, and they

15
00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:53.459
focus on what is specific for nationalism in these

16
00:00:53.459 --> 00:00:58.279
uh uh areas and Uh, about 10 years ago,

17
00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:02.880
um, my university started a new program, International studies

18
00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:05.800
that studied all parts of the world, and we

19
00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:09.290
also had students from all over the world. So,

20
00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.220
I, uh, gave a course there on nationalism and,

21
00:01:13.349 --> 00:01:15.620
well, I had no option but to give them.

22
00:01:16.339 --> 00:01:19.260
The opportunity to write on all parts of the

23
00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:22.410
world. So I got papers on nationalism in Africa,

24
00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.099
in nat in Latin America, in Asia, and I

25
00:01:26.099 --> 00:01:30.459
really became aware that there were many similarities and

26
00:01:30.459 --> 00:01:34.370
parallels and, and so, um, I got triggered to,

27
00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:37.019
to write a, a book that was so much

28
00:01:37.019 --> 00:01:40.260
in need and, uh, um, yeah, that's about the

29
00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:40.839
story.

30
00:01:42.269 --> 00:01:47.470
And when would you say nationalism, uh, started? I

31
00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:50.910
mean, when exactly? Because many people when they think

32
00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:55.830
about nationalism, they tend to associate it start with

33
00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:02.110
the perhaps 18th, 19th century with the rise of

34
00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:06.370
uh nation states, but, uh, when would you put

35
00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:07.849
its origins?

36
00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:12.440
Yeah, um, well, I would put its origin, I,

37
00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:16.880
I agree with, with most, uh, experts that nationalism

38
00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:19.279
is a consequence of the rise of, of, of

39
00:02:19.279 --> 00:02:24.100
modern society. So, um, so it's a modern phenomenon

40
00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:27.220
that was only really Possible in, in the modern

41
00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:30.710
era and I would argue that it arose in

42
00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:35.389
the age of revolutions and, and this can possibly

43
00:02:35.389 --> 00:02:38.550
best be illustrated with the French Revolution. So the

44
00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:42.889
start of the French Revolution was when the traditional

45
00:02:43.619 --> 00:02:48.380
estates general, which represented the estates and not the,

46
00:02:48.389 --> 00:02:53.360
uh, the whole population, um. REBELLED against the king

47
00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:56.960
and the king was sovereign by the grace of

48
00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:59.479
God, so he in a sense received his power

49
00:02:59.479 --> 00:03:03.839
from above. And then the third estate, which represented

50
00:03:03.839 --> 00:03:07.699
90-70% of the population, they said we're not anymore.

51
00:03:09.699 --> 00:03:14.139
Representing a rest category in front of the nobility

52
00:03:14.139 --> 00:03:18.279
and the clergy, but we are the national assembly,

53
00:03:18.619 --> 00:03:22.520
so we do represent the nation, and the nation

54
00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:27.699
then consists of all citizens of France, so. Um,

55
00:03:28.169 --> 00:03:33.570
NATIONALISM arose not as a defining the nation as

56
00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:38.009
a cultural or ethnic group, but simply as all

57
00:03:38.009 --> 00:03:42.550
legal inhabitants of the kingdom of France. So regardless

58
00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:47.330
of people spoke Breton or Catalan or Flemish, or

59
00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:52.889
French, um, all inhabitants and even religious minorities like

60
00:03:52.889 --> 00:03:57.600
the Protestants and the Jews received French citizenship. So

61
00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:01.479
the nation was defined in, in terms of the

62
00:04:01.479 --> 00:04:06.360
community of citizens and the nation was proclaimed sovereign.

63
00:04:06.679 --> 00:04:11.169
So that also meant that The laws should apply

64
00:04:11.169 --> 00:04:14.470
to all in the same way, so a constitution

65
00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:18.730
was needed, elections were needed, a national parliament was

66
00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:24.970
needed. So, uh, nationalism arose, uh, as, uh, also

67
00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:31.850
as a constitutional democracy or at least a parliamentary

68
00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:34.920
system. Um, SO that is where I see the

69
00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:37.450
origins of, of nationalism.

70
00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:42.109
But do you think that there were any precursors

71
00:04:42.109 --> 00:04:47.880
to nationalism and nation states in medieval Europe and

72
00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:50.820
the early modern age or not?

73
00:04:51.359 --> 00:04:56.470
Um. Well, there are instances in which uh the

74
00:04:56.470 --> 00:05:01.549
people rallied behind their king, uh, that, that there

75
00:05:01.549 --> 00:05:06.230
was uh hostility to foreigners. So, um, what we

76
00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:09.149
now, nowadays associate with nationalism, there are a lot

77
00:05:09.149 --> 00:05:13.679
of phenomenon that, that occurred before as well, um.

78
00:05:15.019 --> 00:05:18.660
But in general, um, what happened before the, the

79
00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:22.459
age of revolution was, was very different, so people

80
00:05:22.459 --> 00:05:26.700
still generally believe that power was conferred by God

81
00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:29.839
to the monarch and that you had to abide,

82
00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:33.739
uh, the monarch. If not, you were going against

83
00:05:33.739 --> 00:05:41.760
God's will and so, um, Um, The The way

84
00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:47.019
things functioned was, was fundamentally different and so identities

85
00:05:47.019 --> 00:05:51.299
also were not so much national as they were

86
00:05:51.299 --> 00:05:56.579
primarily local or maybe regional, but more important than

87
00:05:56.579 --> 00:06:01.059
territorial identities were religious identities. So your identity was

88
00:06:01.059 --> 00:06:04.000
primarily, are you a Christian, a Jew, a Muslim,

89
00:06:04.459 --> 00:06:09.390
or a Hindu. And um uh and then your

90
00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:14.130
legal position was determined by your The estate to

91
00:06:14.130 --> 00:06:17.649
which you belong, so legal rules were different for

92
00:06:17.649 --> 00:06:20.549
members of the nobility, for members of the clergy,

93
00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:27.290
for the burghersers of cities, for members of the

94
00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:31.660
guilds, for free farmers or for serfs or slaves.

95
00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:36.250
So each group had its own specific rules, so

96
00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:40.929
there was no So the rules that apply to

97
00:06:40.929 --> 00:06:44.579
you depended on, on your social status and not

98
00:06:44.579 --> 00:06:49.500
on uh your, your territorial belongings. So it, it

99
00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:54.220
also, these territorial belongings also were vague and not

100
00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:56.220
very relevant in everyday life.

101
00:06:57.500 --> 00:07:00.929
OK, so, uh, you talk about the age of

102
00:07:00.929 --> 00:07:05.660
revolutions and the invention of the nation state as

103
00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:08.200
you put in the book in the US and

104
00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:14.179
France. Has nationalism then spread from the West to

105
00:07:14.179 --> 00:07:16.380
the West? Is that how it worked?

106
00:07:17.130 --> 00:07:21.739
Um, Yeah, so it was, so it was invented

107
00:07:21.739 --> 00:07:25.910
in, in Europe and, and maybe also accidentally in,

108
00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:30.029
in uh the Americas in the United States, uh,

109
00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:33.980
but it became But it became a very influential

110
00:07:33.980 --> 00:07:37.959
and attractive model. So it was an attractive model

111
00:07:37.959 --> 00:07:42.200
for educated middle classes around the world because they

112
00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:46.600
also wanted legal equality. They also wanted uh citizenship.

113
00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:51.369
They also wanted uh political participation. So this, this

114
00:07:51.369 --> 00:07:55.609
nation-state model that, that, uh, arose in France really

115
00:07:55.609 --> 00:07:59.250
was very influential around the world. So even in

116
00:07:59.250 --> 00:08:02.769
parts of Africa and Asia, uh, already, uh, at

117
00:08:02.769 --> 00:08:06.970
the, the end of the 18th century. So for

118
00:08:06.970 --> 00:08:11.609
instance, also Haiti became independent and they also adopted

119
00:08:11.609 --> 00:08:15.049
a constitution and a parliament, so they really uh

120
00:08:15.049 --> 00:08:18.529
became the first American, uh, uh, Latin American nation

121
00:08:18.529 --> 00:08:24.519
state. Um. Um, BUT it was also, paradoxically, it

122
00:08:24.519 --> 00:08:29.200
was also attractive to all kinds of traditional rulers,

123
00:08:29.399 --> 00:08:35.520
but because the nation state proved to be very

124
00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:40.599
effective in raising more taxes and also partly because

125
00:08:40.599 --> 00:08:46.080
of the introduction of military service, so the citizens

126
00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:50.460
should serve in the national army, uh, armies became

127
00:08:50.505 --> 00:08:54.905
Much more, much stronger. So traditional rulers, if they

128
00:08:54.905 --> 00:09:00.984
wanted to protect themselves against Western imperialism or to

129
00:09:00.984 --> 00:09:04.565
expand their realms, uh, the cost of their neighbors,

130
00:09:04.974 --> 00:09:08.494
um, they were more or less forced to, um,

131
00:09:09.025 --> 00:09:14.005
to transform their first, their military, so adopt conscription

132
00:09:14.065 --> 00:09:17.960
and uh acquire modern weaponry. But in order to

133
00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:21.099
pay for that, they had to raise more taxes

134
00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:26.140
and um so they generally abolished all kinds of

135
00:09:26.140 --> 00:09:32.890
privileges, uh, feudal rights, um. In order to have

136
00:09:32.890 --> 00:09:37.450
all inhabitants pay the same amount of taxes and

137
00:09:37.450 --> 00:09:42.419
therefore they also introduce legal equality. And in the

138
00:09:42.419 --> 00:09:47.580
end, as a as a capstone to a large

139
00:09:47.580 --> 00:09:50.580
process, they generally also offered some form of political

140
00:09:50.580 --> 00:09:54.059
participation. So what you see is that the Ottoman

141
00:09:54.059 --> 00:09:59.619
Empire, Imperial Japan, even China, but also a country

142
00:09:59.619 --> 00:10:05.059
in Africa like Ethiopia, they slowly adopted the nation-state

143
00:10:05.059 --> 00:10:09.059
model in order to, to survive in the, in

144
00:10:09.059 --> 00:10:10.179
the global arena.

145
00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:17.169
Mm. So, uh, earlier you mentioned how the, I

146
00:10:17.169 --> 00:10:20.690
mean, the first few nation states, at least over

147
00:10:20.690 --> 00:10:25.280
time adopted the constitution, a form of representative government,

148
00:10:25.330 --> 00:10:29.020
and then in the book you go step. By

149
00:10:29.020 --> 00:10:34.020
step through the other elements and institutions that over

150
00:10:34.020 --> 00:10:38.900
time have become inextricably linked with the nation state

151
00:10:38.900 --> 00:10:43.340
model, uh, tell us about national citizenship. How did

152
00:10:43.340 --> 00:10:47.349
it develop over time and who were the people

153
00:10:47.349 --> 00:10:50.179
that got included in the process?

154
00:10:51.049 --> 00:10:55.809
Yeah, interestingly, in, in the French Revolution, um, um,

155
00:10:55.969 --> 00:11:02.070
active citizenship was actually quite broad, so, um, um,

156
00:11:02.210 --> 00:11:06.530
most males could vote, so women were excluded, so

157
00:11:06.530 --> 00:11:09.330
it, it took almost, well, more than a century

158
00:11:09.330 --> 00:11:12.250
for women to, to gain the vote, but almost

159
00:11:12.250 --> 00:11:15.030
all men could vote, but voting was done at

160
00:11:15.210 --> 00:11:17.969
3 different stages, so. First at, at the village

161
00:11:17.969 --> 00:11:22.330
level, then at the uh uh the, the level

162
00:11:22.330 --> 00:11:26.090
of the um uh of, of the, of a

163
00:11:26.090 --> 00:11:29.130
small region and then uh at the level of

164
00:11:29.130 --> 00:11:34.200
the department and um on voting was done on

165
00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:37.500
all kinds of uh local issues, so voting took

166
00:11:37.500 --> 00:11:40.210
a lot of time. So on the local level,

167
00:11:40.330 --> 00:11:44.880
many ordinary people participated, but then they elected their

168
00:11:44.880 --> 00:11:51.950
representative to the departmental level and their um Deliberations

169
00:11:51.950 --> 00:11:55.250
often took about a week, so ordinary people could

170
00:11:55.250 --> 00:11:58.960
not afford to go away for one week without

171
00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:02.619
having, getting any pay. Uh, SO it were, um,

172
00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:06.840
uh, uh, the well-to do who were able to

173
00:12:06.840 --> 00:12:11.520
participate in uh these uh regional uh or these

174
00:12:11.520 --> 00:12:15.700
departmental uh assemblies where then the, uh, the national

175
00:12:16.760 --> 00:12:22.164
representatives. WERE elected, so it effectively excluded the lower

176
00:12:22.164 --> 00:12:26.885
classes from really becoming active at the provincial and

177
00:12:26.885 --> 00:12:31.164
the national level, but after the French Revolution, what

178
00:12:31.164 --> 00:12:38.244
was introduced was sensory suffrage, so only people who

179
00:12:38.244 --> 00:12:43.804
paid a certain amount of taxes were allowed to

180
00:12:43.804 --> 00:12:48.659
vote. And so effectively the, the poorer people were

181
00:12:48.659 --> 00:12:53.140
excluded, um, but not only women and the poor

182
00:12:53.140 --> 00:12:58.260
were excluded, but in general also uncivilized people were

183
00:12:58.260 --> 00:13:01.539
excluded. So this, this becomes particularly clear in the

184
00:13:01.539 --> 00:13:06.789
Americas where um Not, not just uh enslaved people

185
00:13:06.789 --> 00:13:10.929
were excluded um because they were not seen as

186
00:13:10.940 --> 00:13:15.400
as citizens, but also indigenous population were largely excluded

187
00:13:15.400 --> 00:13:19.789
as they were also seen as not rational civilized

188
00:13:19.789 --> 00:13:24.229
people, so they did not receive full citizenship in

189
00:13:24.229 --> 00:13:28.289
the United States, for instance, until the 1920s, uh,

190
00:13:30.059 --> 00:13:34.789
yeah, the 1920s, so more than Uh, Almost 150

191
00:13:34.789 --> 00:13:41.169
years after receiving independence. Um, SO there were, uh,

192
00:13:41.390 --> 00:13:46.289
this process of, of emancipation, um. Uh, TOOK quite

193
00:13:46.289 --> 00:13:49.010
long in the United States, you also have all

194
00:13:49.010 --> 00:13:53.809
these discriminatory rules after the Civil War against participation

195
00:13:53.809 --> 00:13:57.260
of, of black, uh, people in, in voting, and

196
00:13:57.260 --> 00:14:00.080
this only ended in the 1960s with the civil

197
00:14:00.080 --> 00:14:03.630
rights movement. So, so you see all kinds of

198
00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:08.429
emancipatory movements of which, uh, female emancipation is, is,

199
00:14:08.460 --> 00:14:10.830
uh, probably the most, most important.

200
00:14:11.869 --> 00:14:17.239
Right. And how does the nationalist identity develop among

201
00:14:17.239 --> 00:14:20.450
a people? Because I mean, uh, a nation state

202
00:14:20.450 --> 00:14:25.520
is created where it didn't exist one before, uh,

203
00:14:25.700 --> 00:14:29.140
so the same people who live there have to

204
00:14:29.140 --> 00:14:32.739
sort of make that transition to an to an

205
00:14:32.739 --> 00:14:37.099
identity they didn't have before. So how does that

206
00:14:37.099 --> 00:14:37.380
occur?

207
00:14:38.349 --> 00:14:42.710
Yeah, well, well, interestingly, uh, identity and language and

208
00:14:42.710 --> 00:14:45.440
culture was not very relevant at, at the very

209
00:14:45.440 --> 00:14:49.109
start. So during the age of revolutions, France, for

210
00:14:49.109 --> 00:14:53.030
instance, uh, expanded, included parts of Germany, uh, the

211
00:14:53.030 --> 00:14:57.669
Low Countries, Catalonia, Italy, and all these people, whatever

212
00:14:57.669 --> 00:15:03.070
their linguistic or religious background was, became French citizens.

213
00:15:03.229 --> 00:15:06.109
So, so culture and language was not an issue.

214
00:15:06.390 --> 00:15:09.609
It only became an issue during the Romantic era,

215
00:15:09.750 --> 00:15:14.690
so the early 19th century when, uh, uh, especially,

216
00:15:14.799 --> 00:15:18.390
uh, German thinkers came with the idea that every

217
00:15:18.390 --> 00:15:23.320
people has its own language, uh, its own culture,

218
00:15:23.530 --> 00:15:27.979
and therefore also its own collective personality or, or

219
00:15:27.979 --> 00:15:33.789
its own soul or identity and um. As such,

220
00:15:33.909 --> 00:15:37.909
they also argued that every people with its own

221
00:15:37.909 --> 00:15:41.669
language and culture do deserve their own state. So

222
00:15:41.669 --> 00:15:45.549
this was a strong motivation after German unification in

223
00:15:45.549 --> 00:15:51.719
the 19th century, also Italian unification. But the thing

224
00:15:51.719 --> 00:15:55.359
is, uh, in the world today, there are still

225
00:15:55.359 --> 00:16:00.000
7000 languages and there are only not even 200

226
00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:04.659
states, so there is a profound mismatch between, um,

227
00:16:05.080 --> 00:16:10.239
potential culturally defined nations and the actual number of

228
00:16:10.239 --> 00:16:15.099
nation states, um, but, but still the idea that

229
00:16:15.820 --> 00:16:19.020
All members of the nation should speak the same

230
00:16:19.020 --> 00:16:24.219
language and have the same culture became very influential

231
00:16:24.219 --> 00:16:29.659
and so you see that especially when suffrage rights

232
00:16:29.659 --> 00:16:32.500
are extended towards the end of the 19th century,

233
00:16:32.580 --> 00:16:38.489
also including the lower classes, um. Uh, STATES start,

234
00:16:38.750 --> 00:16:44.669
um, paying more attention to primary education. And so

235
00:16:44.669 --> 00:16:49.109
in primary education, people learn the national language, they

236
00:16:49.109 --> 00:16:53.530
learn the glorious history of the fatherland, they learn,

237
00:16:54.669 --> 00:16:58.669
the diversity of the national geography. Uh, SO they

238
00:16:58.669 --> 00:17:02.070
really, uh, really there is a process of nation

239
00:17:02.070 --> 00:17:07.400
building or uh Assimilation or one could even argue

240
00:17:07.400 --> 00:17:12.479
nationalist indoctrination through, through the educational system. And so

241
00:17:12.479 --> 00:17:17.608
this also happens um. Uh, uh, ALMOST globally, uh,

242
00:17:17.739 --> 00:17:21.819
a strong, more attention for primary education and so

243
00:17:21.819 --> 00:17:27.689
really educating, um, the, the children to become, uh,

244
00:17:27.699 --> 00:17:30.900
good patriots. And in France, this process is in

245
00:17:30.900 --> 00:17:33.000
a, in a very famous study, this is called,

246
00:17:33.410 --> 00:17:37.810
uh, turning peasants into Frenchmen. Um, BECAUSE in France,

247
00:17:37.930 --> 00:17:40.569
half of the population did not even speak French,

248
00:17:40.890 --> 00:17:44.910
so they, because of this process through education, they,

249
00:17:45.089 --> 00:17:50.130
they were turned into, um, well behaved French speaking

250
00:17:50.130 --> 00:17:50.790
citizens.

251
00:17:51.300 --> 00:17:55.859
Mhm. So you, you mentioned education there. How about

252
00:17:55.859 --> 00:18:01.859
the introduction of things like a centralized bureaucracy, individual

253
00:18:01.859 --> 00:18:07.250
property rights, and legal equality? How did that, uh,

254
00:18:07.260 --> 00:18:08.380
occur over time?

255
00:18:08.979 --> 00:18:13.500
Um, SO this, this was also very important. So

256
00:18:13.500 --> 00:18:17.989
what you see is that, um, Uh, all kinds

257
00:18:17.989 --> 00:18:23.670
of traditional states, but also European, uh, colonies in,

258
00:18:23.750 --> 00:18:27.609
in Asia and later also, uh, in, in Africa,

259
00:18:28.270 --> 00:18:34.020
they start adopting very similar institutions, adopting private property

260
00:18:34.020 --> 00:18:36.239
in order to be able to tax all the,

261
00:18:36.369 --> 00:18:40.854
the farmers. Um, FARMERS need to produce for the

262
00:18:40.854 --> 00:18:43.775
market in order to, to have money to pay

263
00:18:43.775 --> 00:18:47.655
for these taxes. You see the introduction of conscription

264
00:18:47.655 --> 00:18:52.155
everywhere. You see the introduction of modern education systems.

265
00:18:52.454 --> 00:18:55.515
Uh, SO the model of the, the nation state

266
00:18:55.854 --> 00:19:00.760
and, and it, it, uh, It, it, it is

267
00:19:00.760 --> 00:19:04.800
a European model, but it is also adopted by

268
00:19:04.800 --> 00:19:07.479
independent states as I already said. So the best

269
00:19:07.479 --> 00:19:11.199
case is, is Japan which, uh, in the Meiji

270
00:19:11.199 --> 00:19:14.800
Restoration at the end of the 19th century fully

271
00:19:14.800 --> 00:19:19.479
adopts, uh, European institutions, uh, the organization of the

272
00:19:19.479 --> 00:19:23.680
military, of the education, the healthcare system. Everything is

273
00:19:23.680 --> 00:19:27.420
modeled after, um, European examples.

274
00:19:28.569 --> 00:19:35.699
And what kind of nationalist radicalization occurred from 1885

275
00:19:35.699 --> 00:19:39.660
to 1914 and how did it lead to World

276
00:19:39.660 --> 00:19:40.500
War I?

277
00:19:41.900 --> 00:19:46.099
Yeah, well, that, that is a complex phenomenon. Um,

278
00:19:46.599 --> 00:19:49.939
WHAT you see is that in the second half

279
00:19:49.939 --> 00:19:53.140
of the 19th century, there is lowering of trade

280
00:19:53.140 --> 00:19:58.819
barriers, uh, uh, there is more international cooperation, the

281
00:19:58.819 --> 00:20:02.219
opening up also of new markets like the opening

282
00:20:02.219 --> 00:20:05.849
of Japan. Uh, FOR free trade, the opening of,

283
00:20:05.859 --> 00:20:09.140
uh, uh, China, uh, but what you see is

284
00:20:09.140 --> 00:20:12.339
that from the end of the 19th century, and

285
00:20:12.339 --> 00:20:18.099
especially, um, the, um, The, the, the struggle for

286
00:20:18.099 --> 00:20:22.900
the colonization of Africa. Um, IT is not anymore

287
00:20:22.900 --> 00:20:27.660
about opening up uh Africa for free trade, but

288
00:20:27.660 --> 00:20:30.290
it is, and this is decided at the conference

289
00:20:30.290 --> 00:20:33.859
in Berlin in 1885. You can only claim parts

290
00:20:33.859 --> 00:20:38.020
of Africa if you effectively occupy them, and this

291
00:20:38.020 --> 00:20:41.160
means that the scramble for Africa turns into a

292
00:20:41.500 --> 00:20:46.670
scrambling for territories that are for exclusive use. By

293
00:20:46.670 --> 00:20:51.119
the um Uh, by the imperial power, by the

294
00:20:51.119 --> 00:20:56.160
occupying power, and this also leads to, um, more

295
00:20:56.160 --> 00:21:00.180
protectionism, something that we see, uh, today as well,

296
00:21:00.599 --> 00:21:05.599
and, uh, so to growing global rivalries between the

297
00:21:05.599 --> 00:21:08.599
major powers and at the same time you also

298
00:21:08.599 --> 00:21:13.920
see the rise of racist, uh, uh, ideas, uh,

299
00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:21.150
so about racist, racial differences. Um, BUT interestingly, so

300
00:21:21.150 --> 00:21:24.949
we think of this period as the heyday of

301
00:21:24.949 --> 00:21:28.310
nationalism, so and that this, this ended in the

302
00:21:28.310 --> 00:21:32.650
First World War where all these nation states fiercely

303
00:21:32.650 --> 00:21:36.589
clashed and fought a very brutal war, but in

304
00:21:36.589 --> 00:21:42.050
fact all powers, almost all powers that participated in

305
00:21:42.050 --> 00:21:47.270
the First World War also were empires and racial

306
00:21:47.270 --> 00:21:51.770
ideas. Do not really match with national ideas. So

307
00:21:51.770 --> 00:21:54.569
there is the, the white race or some spoke

308
00:21:54.569 --> 00:21:57.530
of the Germanic race or the Latin races, but

309
00:21:57.530 --> 00:22:00.930
races are larger than national boundaries. So it's a,

310
00:22:01.010 --> 00:22:04.839
it's a kind of paradoxical period in which um

311
00:22:05.329 --> 00:22:12.500
the Um, the rise of xenophobic ideas of international

312
00:22:12.500 --> 00:22:18.660
rivalries, of, uh, imperialism, um, this all is on

313
00:22:18.660 --> 00:22:21.280
the rise and leads to a lot of violence,

314
00:22:21.989 --> 00:22:24.099
uh, but at the same time, it is not

315
00:22:24.099 --> 00:22:27.339
a world of equal nation states that, that is

316
00:22:27.339 --> 00:22:28.959
dominant in this period.

317
00:22:30.619 --> 00:22:37.670
And were empires, particularly the European empires, also nationalized?

318
00:22:39.079 --> 00:22:42.439
Yeah, yeah, so, so we tend to think of

319
00:22:42.439 --> 00:22:46.270
empire and nation state as two different entities, but,

320
00:22:46.280 --> 00:22:52.780
uh, until the 1960s, most big European powers also

321
00:22:53.040 --> 00:22:55.479
were nation states, but at the same time they

322
00:22:55.479 --> 00:23:00.619
were empires, um. Uh, AND so what they did

323
00:23:00.619 --> 00:23:03.439
and what we see nowadays as well is that

324
00:23:03.439 --> 00:23:08.479
they mobilized nationalist feelings also in order to defend

325
00:23:08.479 --> 00:23:13.959
their imperial ambitions. So the prestige of your nation

326
00:23:13.959 --> 00:23:18.489
state depended also on having a large amount of,

327
00:23:18.550 --> 00:23:23.814
of colonies. So Germany. And, and Italy after the

328
00:23:23.814 --> 00:23:28.435
First World War, or Germany lost their, their colonies,

329
00:23:29.295 --> 00:23:32.574
uh, the, the, the Nazis really wanted to have

330
00:23:32.574 --> 00:23:36.734
an empire, so they were fiercely nationalist, but they

331
00:23:36.734 --> 00:23:41.795
also decided we need to have um um Lebensha,

332
00:23:42.224 --> 00:23:44.255
we, we need to have an empire. We need

333
00:23:44.255 --> 00:23:48.319
to have Um, living space, especially in Eastern Europe,

334
00:23:48.369 --> 00:23:51.729
in order to be, uh, seen as a, as

335
00:23:51.729 --> 00:23:54.550
a global and, and, uh, a big power.

336
00:23:55.479 --> 00:23:58.959
Mhm. And what was the impact of the First

337
00:23:58.959 --> 00:24:01.650
World War on nation states?

338
00:24:03.310 --> 00:24:05.069
Well, what we see is that at the end

339
00:24:05.069 --> 00:24:10.329
of the First World War, some of the empires

340
00:24:11.150 --> 00:24:17.349
Disappears. So the Austrian-Hungary Empire disappears, uh, the Tsarist

341
00:24:17.349 --> 00:24:22.829
Empire disappears, and also the Ottoman Empire disappears. And

342
00:24:22.829 --> 00:24:26.439
what we get instead are new nation states, uh,

343
00:24:26.709 --> 00:24:30.790
in most cases, and um this is also very

344
00:24:30.790 --> 00:24:35.060
much helped by Wilson who proclaimed the right to

345
00:24:35.069 --> 00:24:43.859
self-determination. But interestingly, the idea of self-determination also um

346
00:24:44.359 --> 00:24:47.680
uh resonated in the rest of the world. So

347
00:24:47.680 --> 00:24:53.520
Egyptian nationalists, Syrian nationalist, nationalists from Korea, from China,

348
00:24:53.640 --> 00:24:58.520
they also appealed to the right to self-determination to

349
00:24:58.520 --> 00:25:01.699
become independent or in the case of China to

350
00:25:02.119 --> 00:25:06.150
To get rid of the, the uh uh foreign

351
00:25:06.680 --> 00:25:15.270
occupied territories. Um, BUT Wilson did not mean self-determination

352
00:25:15.270 --> 00:25:18.089
for the rest of the world and, and England

353
00:25:18.089 --> 00:25:20.689
and France with their huge empires were not very

354
00:25:20.689 --> 00:25:23.839
inclined to give up their empires either. So the,

355
00:25:24.489 --> 00:25:30.020
the right to self-determination. Was only applied to civilized

356
00:25:30.020 --> 00:25:33.060
European nations in a sense.

357
00:25:33.780 --> 00:25:38.089
Mhm. And what happened when it comes to nationalization

358
00:25:38.089 --> 00:25:41.599
between the two world wars and what was then

359
00:25:41.599 --> 00:25:45.439
the impact of World War II on nation states?

360
00:25:46.459 --> 00:25:51.239
Um, YEAH, so, during the Second World, uh, or,

361
00:25:51.280 --> 00:25:55.239
or during the, the interwar period, we see first

362
00:25:55.239 --> 00:26:00.400
a period of, of stabilization of international cooperation, but

363
00:26:00.400 --> 00:26:03.959
then quickly after, especially after 1929, we see the

364
00:26:03.959 --> 00:26:07.520
rise of fascist movements and, and the fascists come

365
00:26:07.520 --> 00:26:11.479
to power first in Italy early 1922 and then

366
00:26:11.479 --> 00:26:14.439
in, in Germany as well, and so we see

367
00:26:14.439 --> 00:26:21.189
tensions on the rise again. Um, Um And, and

368
00:26:21.189 --> 00:26:25.900
what happens is that they and also um Imperial

369
00:26:25.900 --> 00:26:32.689
Japan, uh, their policies are explicitly racist, so, um,

370
00:26:33.270 --> 00:26:38.160
the European colonial powers also uh were quite racist

371
00:26:38.160 --> 00:26:40.910
and so were the United States, but it was

372
00:26:40.910 --> 00:26:44.469
not part of their official rhetoric and in Nazi

373
00:26:44.469 --> 00:26:47.780
Germany, uh, this really was the case, uh. And,

374
00:26:47.819 --> 00:26:52.780
and also Imperial Japan was uh really saw itself

375
00:26:52.780 --> 00:26:56.900
as superior to the, to the other uh uh

376
00:26:57.219 --> 00:27:01.199
Asian territories that it liberated from, from the West.

377
00:27:01.619 --> 00:27:05.739
Um SO what you see after 95, 45 is

378
00:27:05.739 --> 00:27:09.420
a kind of backlash. So open racism becomes kind

379
00:27:09.420 --> 00:27:14.510
of taboo. Uh, European powers also understand that they

380
00:27:14.510 --> 00:27:18.130
will have to treat the population of their colonies,

381
00:27:18.619 --> 00:27:22.119
uh, in a more equal way, so they start

382
00:27:22.550 --> 00:27:28.650
kind of transforming their imperial, uh, uh, realms into

383
00:27:28.650 --> 00:27:34.349
a more egalitarian, um, Commonwealth, the British Commonwealth, for

384
00:27:34.349 --> 00:27:38.270
instance, or France tries to, to turn the empire

385
00:27:38.270 --> 00:27:42.349
in the French union. Uh, IN which all territories

386
00:27:42.349 --> 00:27:46.510
more or less have the same status, um, but

387
00:27:46.510 --> 00:27:51.500
one politician in France, uh, Edouard Henriot, a former

388
00:27:51.500 --> 00:27:55.410
prime minister in the debates on the new constitution

389
00:27:55.410 --> 00:27:59.989
of this French Union, he also argued, uh, we

390
00:27:59.989 --> 00:28:03.510
do not want to be ruled by, uh, the

391
00:28:03.510 --> 00:28:09.209
people from the colonies. So even though they Uh,

392
00:28:09.219 --> 00:28:12.849
try to create a more egalitarian empire, it was

393
00:28:12.849 --> 00:28:15.930
also clear that power would remain in the hands

394
00:28:15.930 --> 00:28:22.280
of Paris or London and that at most the

395
00:28:22.280 --> 00:28:26.329
inhabitants of the colonies would be second-rate citizens, and

396
00:28:26.329 --> 00:28:28.630
this is also very clear in all kinds of

397
00:28:29.130 --> 00:28:33.290
social security regulations. They did not apply to, to

398
00:28:33.290 --> 00:28:36.859
the colonies. Um, AND so this was really an

399
00:28:36.859 --> 00:28:41.199
incentive also for the independence, uh, movements. Mhm.

400
00:28:41.589 --> 00:28:46.750
And what happened after 1945, that is after the

401
00:28:46.750 --> 00:28:51.390
Second World War, and up to 1979 with the

402
00:28:51.390 --> 00:28:55.810
more modernization of nation states and the dissolution of

403
00:28:56.069 --> 00:28:58.020
colonial empires?

404
00:28:58.510 --> 00:29:02.219
Yeah, so, so interestingly this has been seen as,

405
00:29:02.310 --> 00:29:07.369
as a period of um Uh, the rise of

406
00:29:07.369 --> 00:29:11.760
independence movements, um, but it was at the same

407
00:29:11.760 --> 00:29:19.969
time also Empires understanding that the position and, and

408
00:29:19.969 --> 00:29:23.810
the situation was not tenable, so they were also

409
00:29:24.079 --> 00:29:26.949
willing to give up their colony. So, so it

410
00:29:26.949 --> 00:29:30.750
was reluctant. It, it happened slowly. It took decades

411
00:29:30.750 --> 00:29:32.790
in most cases and a lot of pressure and

412
00:29:32.790 --> 00:29:35.829
often sometimes a lot of violence in order to

413
00:29:35.829 --> 00:29:38.630
happen, but they did not cling to their empires.

414
00:29:38.750 --> 00:29:42.390
Well, Portugal maybe is a, is a small exception.

415
00:29:42.770 --> 00:29:48.050
Um, uh, BUT, um, Um, this was the, the

416
00:29:48.050 --> 00:29:52.890
general tendency, but interestingly, national identities in this period

417
00:29:52.890 --> 00:29:55.930
were not emphasized. So what was important in this

418
00:29:55.930 --> 00:30:01.630
period was modernization. Um, PROGRESS. So what you see

419
00:30:01.630 --> 00:30:06.209
is, um, for instance, the agricultural revolution happened in

420
00:30:06.209 --> 00:30:10.810
this period, so new, uh, varieties were created of

421
00:30:10.810 --> 00:30:14.890
grain, of corn, of, of rice that had a

422
00:30:14.890 --> 00:30:21.170
much higher, um, um, output and so the, um,

423
00:30:21.680 --> 00:30:24.839
It is the period of the mechanization of the

424
00:30:24.839 --> 00:30:31.199
countryside of also more efficient, larger plots. So what

425
00:30:31.199 --> 00:30:34.890
you see is that the countryside throughout the world

426
00:30:34.890 --> 00:30:39.959
became much more similar and new buildings were mostly

427
00:30:39.959 --> 00:30:44.699
built of concrete, were very so. Traditionally, the countryside

428
00:30:44.699 --> 00:30:49.160
was the part of where uh vernacular culture, where

429
00:30:49.160 --> 00:30:52.680
traditions were cherished, where typical buildings could be found,

430
00:30:52.880 --> 00:30:56.880
and this disappears quite quickly in the, in the

431
00:30:56.880 --> 00:30:59.880
1950s and 1960s, and the same happens in the

432
00:30:59.880 --> 00:31:02.819
cities. Everywhere in the world, you see the same.

433
00:31:03.839 --> 00:31:08.479
STEEL and glass buildings arise, high rise buildings, the

434
00:31:08.479 --> 00:31:13.500
invention of, of air conditioning is is very important

435
00:31:13.500 --> 00:31:16.030
there as well. So there was no need anymore

436
00:31:16.489 --> 00:31:20.199
to, to take into account climatic conditions. One could

437
00:31:20.199 --> 00:31:23.420
build the same buildings everywhere around the world. And

438
00:31:23.420 --> 00:31:27.380
a nice example is, is Brazil, where a new,

439
00:31:27.579 --> 00:31:32.140
a totally new capital, Brasilia was built in the

440
00:31:32.140 --> 00:31:35.260
midst of the jungle and building materials were fled

441
00:31:35.260 --> 00:31:40.099
in with, with airplanes, um, and the streets have

442
00:31:40.099 --> 00:31:44.540
no names, so there are no references to Brazilian

443
00:31:44.540 --> 00:31:48.979
history. It is just uh numbers. And all buildings,

444
00:31:48.989 --> 00:31:51.699
uh, have the same size and the same look,

445
00:31:52.310 --> 00:31:56.420
uh, so it's a very rational, uh, city, uh,

446
00:31:56.430 --> 00:32:00.949
with no particular Brazilian identity except for the name

447
00:32:00.949 --> 00:32:03.869
of the city, um, and so this is what

448
00:32:03.869 --> 00:32:06.670
we see happening everywhere around the world, so it's

449
00:32:06.670 --> 00:32:11.390
a period of, of Independent nation states, so the

450
00:32:11.390 --> 00:32:14.609
nation state really becomes the dominant form of statehood,

451
00:32:15.109 --> 00:32:18.390
uh, but at the same time, national differences, uh,

452
00:32:18.589 --> 00:32:20.750
largely disappeared during this period.

453
00:32:21.439 --> 00:32:26.270
OK. And what was the role played by international

454
00:32:26.719 --> 00:32:31.680
organizations, if any, like the United Nations and the

455
00:32:31.680 --> 00:32:37.880
International Monetary Fund in the process of nation-state formation

456
00:32:37.880 --> 00:32:39.640
during the 20th century?

457
00:32:40.719 --> 00:32:45.280
Yeah, so, interestingly, um, what, what we see is

458
00:32:45.280 --> 00:32:51.020
that, um, Well, all former colonies adopt, uh, the,

459
00:32:51.560 --> 00:32:53.619
the, the template of the nation state, so the

460
00:32:53.619 --> 00:32:56.579
nation now is sovereign, it's a nation of citizens,

461
00:32:56.699 --> 00:33:00.739
so most African countries are very, uh, diverse as

462
00:33:00.739 --> 00:33:05.369
well. Many languages are spoken, um. So it's the,

463
00:33:05.390 --> 00:33:10.150
the, the community of citizens that becomes independent. All

464
00:33:10.150 --> 00:33:12.750
countries need a flag. So if you go to

465
00:33:12.750 --> 00:33:16.750
the United States, to the United Nations, your flag

466
00:33:16.750 --> 00:33:20.069
should be visible outside of the building. You need

467
00:33:20.069 --> 00:33:26.050
an anthem. You need a parliament, elections, a constitution,

468
00:33:26.500 --> 00:33:31.550
and also, um. Uh, ALL kinds of institutions like

469
00:33:31.550 --> 00:33:35.260
the World Health Organizations, the IMF, the World Bank,

470
00:33:35.489 --> 00:33:40.750
they also impose certain standard institutions. So if you

471
00:33:40.750 --> 00:33:44.550
want a loan from the IMF, you are forced

472
00:33:44.550 --> 00:33:48.510
to adopt all kinds of accounting mechanisms from the

473
00:33:48.510 --> 00:33:54.000
IMF. Um, THE World Health Organization defines diseases and

474
00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:57.280
the way these diseases should be treated globally. So,

475
00:33:57.439 --> 00:33:59.939
so what we see is a process of growing,

476
00:34:00.199 --> 00:34:05.800
uh, homogenization through these international organizations.

477
00:34:06.969 --> 00:34:11.250
And tell us about how over time nation states

478
00:34:11.250 --> 00:34:16.409
started to provide more services to wider sections of

479
00:34:16.409 --> 00:34:20.649
their population and many adopted, for example, the model

480
00:34:20.649 --> 00:34:24.850
of the welfare state, as well as the emancipation

481
00:34:24.850 --> 00:34:32.370
of women, indigenous populations, the LGBTQY plus community, and

482
00:34:32.370 --> 00:34:32.770
so on.

483
00:34:33.849 --> 00:34:36.947
Yeah, so, so, um, I think this, there are,

484
00:34:37.108 --> 00:34:41.428
there are two, there are two distinct phases. So

485
00:34:41.428 --> 00:34:43.388
first of all, what you see in the, in

486
00:34:43.388 --> 00:34:47.868
the post-war period is, um, a very strong emphasis

487
00:34:47.868 --> 00:34:52.179
also on the, the welfare state. So, Uh, even

488
00:34:52.179 --> 00:34:57.780
independent African countries try to provide education, uh, healthcare,

489
00:34:58.139 --> 00:35:02.280
uh, assistance to the needy, um, for their population,

490
00:35:02.939 --> 00:35:05.659
and, and it's, it's very difficult because you need

491
00:35:05.659 --> 00:35:08.919
a lot of, uh, of money for that, um.

492
00:35:09.570 --> 00:35:12.929
Um, BUT it's, it's a global process. You also

493
00:35:12.929 --> 00:35:14.929
see it in the communist world where the, the

494
00:35:14.929 --> 00:35:17.770
welfare state is even more important and also in

495
00:35:17.770 --> 00:35:21.209
many African countries where this is mostly also organized

496
00:35:21.209 --> 00:35:25.000
in a slightly different way through enterprises and, and,

497
00:35:25.010 --> 00:35:28.915
uh, neighborhoods uh or. Organizations, um, but this is

498
00:35:28.915 --> 00:35:31.965
a tendency you see very strongly in the 1950s

499
00:35:31.965 --> 00:35:36.395
and 1960s and early 1970s, but then the, the,

500
00:35:36.524 --> 00:35:39.675
the 1970s really are, are a turning point. So

501
00:35:39.675 --> 00:35:42.965
what we see is the oil crisis is very

502
00:35:42.965 --> 00:35:50.320
important and um Both in the capitalist world and

503
00:35:50.320 --> 00:35:53.840
in the communist world, it is the regime struggle

504
00:35:53.840 --> 00:35:56.919
to find an answer. So we have in most

505
00:35:56.919 --> 00:36:03.199
countries uh higher debts, um, uh, inflation, uh, growing,

506
00:36:03.209 --> 00:36:10.719
um, uh, unemployment, scarcity in uh, in the communist

507
00:36:10.719 --> 00:36:14.010
countries, so people line up for the shops, um,

508
00:36:14.520 --> 00:36:21.199
so. And in the Western world, It is neoliberalism

509
00:36:21.659 --> 00:36:25.899
that is the kind of answer, uh, so what

510
00:36:25.899 --> 00:36:29.330
you see is that the welfare state is, uh,

511
00:36:29.639 --> 00:36:33.830
well. The, it, it is diminished, uh, so it

512
00:36:33.830 --> 00:36:37.739
becomes less important and many parts were also, uh,

513
00:36:37.750 --> 00:36:41.709
suffer severe budget cuts, um, but what happens is

514
00:36:41.709 --> 00:36:47.070
that, um, markets are opened up, um, it is

515
00:36:47.070 --> 00:36:50.030
not the government who should decide what happens, but

516
00:36:50.030 --> 00:36:55.709
it is markets and market forces, um. But together

517
00:36:55.709 --> 00:36:59.620
with the, the rise of neoliberalism and, and especially

518
00:36:59.629 --> 00:37:04.100
it's the, the election of Margaret Thatcher in 1979,

519
00:37:04.149 --> 00:37:07.189
of Ronald Reagan in 1980, that, that really is

520
00:37:07.189 --> 00:37:10.590
a kind of turning point here, um, but at

521
00:37:10.590 --> 00:37:12.590
the same time you see also the rise of

522
00:37:12.590 --> 00:37:17.550
identity politics, so In the 1950s and 196960s, social

523
00:37:17.550 --> 00:37:21.209
movements focused on the welfare state, so on more

524
00:37:21.429 --> 00:37:25.929
social security, on higher wages, but you see that

525
00:37:26.110 --> 00:37:33.149
many indigenous communities, um, but also the LGBTB community,

526
00:37:35.149 --> 00:37:39.149
um, uh, they start focusing on rights, on human

527
00:37:39.149 --> 00:37:43.780
rights, and also respect for their own culture. Um,

528
00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:46.120
AND this is what you see in the Americas

529
00:37:46.120 --> 00:37:50.000
with, uh, um, the, the civil rights movement is

530
00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:52.879
a very strong incentive here, but it is also

531
00:37:52.879 --> 00:37:56.439
taken up by a lot of indigenous communities in

532
00:37:56.439 --> 00:38:00.080
North America, but also in South America. Um, THE

533
00:38:00.080 --> 00:38:03.239
Aboriginals in Australia, for instance, start a kind of

534
00:38:03.239 --> 00:38:07.120
emancipation process, um, but you also see a kind

535
00:38:07.120 --> 00:38:12.409
of return of religion. So religion. Uh, AND it's

536
00:38:12.850 --> 00:38:20.550
basically also majority populations that play for a bigger

537
00:38:20.550 --> 00:38:25.580
role of their religion in the specific policies of

538
00:38:25.580 --> 00:38:28.510
their country and, and another turning point here is

539
00:38:28.510 --> 00:38:33.260
the Iranian Revolution of 1979, so the same. YEAR

540
00:38:33.260 --> 00:38:36.449
is a turning point also for neoliberalism. This is

541
00:38:36.449 --> 00:38:40.219
also the breakthrough moment one could argue for, for

542
00:38:40.219 --> 00:38:45.219
um um religious identity politics, and 1979 is also

543
00:38:45.219 --> 00:38:49.449
the year when in the United States. The evangelicals,

544
00:38:49.469 --> 00:38:52.469
uh, uh mobilize and really try to put their

545
00:38:52.469 --> 00:38:59.570
agenda of, uh, um, um, uh, patriotism, uh, against,

546
00:38:59.669 --> 00:39:06.010
uh, abortion, um, and, uh. And, and more attention

547
00:39:06.010 --> 00:39:10.879
for family uh uh traditional family norms, uh, they

548
00:39:10.879 --> 00:39:13.040
put it on the political agenda as well. So

549
00:39:13.040 --> 00:39:17.239
you see, uh, the rise of, of identity politics,

550
00:39:17.250 --> 00:39:21.780
both of minorities and of majorities uh starting already

551
00:39:21.780 --> 00:39:24.620
in the, in the late 1970s.

552
00:39:25.689 --> 00:39:29.330
So let me ask you now about the influence

553
00:39:29.330 --> 00:39:33.969
of nationalism on culture and several different kinds of

554
00:39:33.969 --> 00:39:38.870
cultural practices and also how those cultural practices have

555
00:39:39.159 --> 00:39:43.830
contributed to helping fashion a sort of. World of

556
00:39:43.830 --> 00:39:49.149
discrimination. So how does nationalism influence the arts and

557
00:39:49.149 --> 00:39:55.949
the humanities mapping, uh, its dissemination through, uh, media

558
00:39:55.949 --> 00:39:59.550
like newspapers, television, and social media?

559
00:40:00.129 --> 00:40:04.820
Um, SO a lot of questions. Um, SO maybe

560
00:40:04.820 --> 00:40:09.189
let's start with, with the sciences. So from the,

561
00:40:09.409 --> 00:40:13.360
uh, early 19th century onwards in the Romantic era,

562
00:40:13.570 --> 00:40:16.649
so the idea is that each people has its

563
00:40:16.649 --> 00:40:19.870
own personality and so in order to understand this

564
00:40:19.870 --> 00:40:24.754
personality, you have to understand its Evolution. So, the

565
00:40:24.754 --> 00:40:29.705
romantic era also is the, the, the era, the

566
00:40:29.705 --> 00:40:33.995
rise and professionalization of the science of history, the

567
00:40:33.995 --> 00:40:38.354
study of history becomes very important and history writing

568
00:40:38.354 --> 00:40:41.955
from this moment onward is basically national history writing.

569
00:40:42.074 --> 00:40:44.995
So the nation or the nation state becomes the

570
00:40:44.995 --> 00:40:49.100
main unit. To study the past and uh this

571
00:40:49.100 --> 00:40:53.810
also happens to art history, literary history. So what

572
00:40:54.270 --> 00:40:58.909
these scholars do is really define the culture of

573
00:40:58.909 --> 00:41:02.449
the nation, how it evolved over time and what

574
00:41:02.510 --> 00:41:07.149
is its most characteristics and glorious uh uh aspects.

575
00:41:07.459 --> 00:41:10.750
So the sciences, the humanities become very national, but

576
00:41:10.750 --> 00:41:13.870
the same is also true of, uh, the social

577
00:41:13.870 --> 00:41:18.010
sciences, so. Economy is the study of either domestic

578
00:41:18.010 --> 00:41:22.679
economy or international economy. Politics is the study of

579
00:41:22.679 --> 00:41:27.570
international relations between nation states or domestic politics. In

580
00:41:27.570 --> 00:41:33.250
statistics, Numbers, statistics are gathered on a national level.

581
00:41:33.370 --> 00:41:36.310
So the nation state again is the basic unit

582
00:41:36.719 --> 00:41:42.399
for comparative studies or for studying developments of the

583
00:41:42.399 --> 00:41:48.590
population of the health of the population. Um, SO

584
00:41:48.590 --> 00:41:52.110
the, the nation state really becomes the, the, the

585
00:41:52.110 --> 00:41:56.669
main unit for, um, both the humanities and the

586
00:41:56.669 --> 00:42:00.510
social sciences and even hard sciences like, uh, like

587
00:42:00.510 --> 00:42:05.060
statistics. And then, um, what you also have is

588
00:42:05.060 --> 00:42:09.939
the construction of national culture. So painters start to

589
00:42:09.939 --> 00:42:13.699
paint, uh, history, uh, paintings uh with, with national

590
00:42:13.699 --> 00:42:19.010
heroes or typical landscapes, uh, scientists go out to,

591
00:42:19.310 --> 00:42:24.600
to write down, uh, folkloric stories. Um, YOU have,

592
00:42:24.679 --> 00:42:30.250
um, when Particular landscapes are protected, which starts in

593
00:42:30.250 --> 00:42:33.479
the United States. It is not called uh uh

594
00:42:34.250 --> 00:42:37.129
a natural park, but it's called a national park.

595
00:42:37.250 --> 00:42:42.850
So, typical landscapes are in a way nationalized, become

596
00:42:42.850 --> 00:42:46.689
part of a national patrimony, and what I found

597
00:42:46.689 --> 00:42:50.729
very interesting also is the nationalization of food practices.

598
00:42:51.209 --> 00:42:55.780
So, In the 19th century, uh, the poor, they,

599
00:42:56.199 --> 00:42:59.120
they just ate what they could get, so very

600
00:42:59.120 --> 00:43:04.129
simple. There are no recipes needed. Um, AND the

601
00:43:04.129 --> 00:43:09.570
rich generally tended to adopt, uh, the culinary standards

602
00:43:09.570 --> 00:43:14.169
of, uh, high society which in Europe was and,

603
00:43:14.239 --> 00:43:16.800
and many, many parts of the Western world was,

604
00:43:16.810 --> 00:43:20.479
uh, the, the French, uh, uh, culinary traditions, the

605
00:43:20.479 --> 00:43:25.649
high cuisine, which originated in the, the culinary traditions

606
00:43:25.649 --> 00:43:29.360
of the French court. And the same happened in

607
00:43:29.459 --> 00:43:33.340
um the Ottoman Empire and in China, for instance,

608
00:43:33.459 --> 00:43:37.060
there, the, the court also set the standards for

609
00:43:37.060 --> 00:43:41.939
um uh for culinary traditions, but what happens at

610
00:43:41.939 --> 00:43:45.459
the end of the 19th century is that Um,

611
00:43:45.659 --> 00:43:50.340
all kinds of authors start writing national cookbooks, so

612
00:43:50.340 --> 00:43:57.139
French, um, cuisine, Italian cuisine, Spanish, uh, Portuguese, uh,

613
00:43:57.290 --> 00:44:01.520
uh, Mexican cuisine. And they write it primarily for

614
00:44:02.739 --> 00:44:07.780
housewives. So it is the traditional cuisine for ordinary

615
00:44:07.780 --> 00:44:11.139
people. So it's basically for the middle classes. These

616
00:44:11.139 --> 00:44:14.060
are the people who can afford to buy a

617
00:44:14.060 --> 00:44:19.419
cookbook, who can afford sufficient food in order to

618
00:44:19.419 --> 00:44:24.379
have real recipes and diversified meals. So what you

619
00:44:24.379 --> 00:44:28.570
see really is A nationalization of food practices and

620
00:44:28.570 --> 00:44:31.129
we now see it also in restaurants. So everywhere

621
00:44:31.129 --> 00:44:33.030
in the world, you can go to a Chinese,

622
00:44:33.629 --> 00:44:39.090
Mexican, Italian restaurant. Um, SO ethnic foods, as we

623
00:44:39.090 --> 00:44:41.489
call it, it, it, it's a misnomer because it

624
00:44:41.489 --> 00:44:46.290
is national food, uh, really have become dominant around,

625
00:44:46.300 --> 00:44:47.449
uh, around the globe.

626
00:44:48.110 --> 00:44:52.909
Mhm. So you mentioned lots of different uh cultural

627
00:44:52.909 --> 00:44:57.419
practices there. What about sports and tourism? I mean,

628
00:44:57.510 --> 00:45:02.610
in sports, particularly with events like the Olympic Games,

629
00:45:02.790 --> 00:45:05.729
in what ways do you think that might contribute

630
00:45:05.729 --> 00:45:10.459
to, uh, fashioning the world of discrete nations?

631
00:45:11.469 --> 00:45:15.129
Yeah, so I think sports is, is extremely important,

632
00:45:15.139 --> 00:45:18.060
and, but the interesting thing of sports also is

633
00:45:18.060 --> 00:45:22.530
that it's, it is, um, uh, we say it

634
00:45:22.530 --> 00:45:27.040
is national teams, but these nations are only um

635
00:45:27.979 --> 00:45:30.780
the nation states, the member, member states of the

636
00:45:30.780 --> 00:45:34.939
IOC. So if you are a nation without a

637
00:45:34.939 --> 00:45:39.780
state like Catalonia or the Kurds or the Flemish.

638
00:45:40.120 --> 00:45:43.199
You cannot participate in the Olympic Games or in

639
00:45:43.199 --> 00:45:46.600
World Cup football. Um, YOU need to have a

640
00:45:46.600 --> 00:45:50.280
state that becomes a member of, uh, of the

641
00:45:50.280 --> 00:45:55.770
IOC and is recognized on the international stage. Um,

642
00:45:56.360 --> 00:45:59.800
AND then, so, uh, what we see also is

643
00:45:59.800 --> 00:46:02.840
that people tend to rally behind their national team,

644
00:46:03.080 --> 00:46:07.820
especially or sportsmen, especially if they are very successful.

645
00:46:08.639 --> 00:46:12.120
Um, AND what happens is that, uh, all kinds

646
00:46:12.120 --> 00:46:16.080
of minorities in general also rally behind, uh, the

647
00:46:16.080 --> 00:46:19.560
flag. So in Cameroon, for instance, the, the football

648
00:46:19.560 --> 00:46:22.879
team is very successful in, in the Africa Cup,

649
00:46:22.889 --> 00:46:26.659
for instance, but also at World Cups. And so

650
00:46:26.659 --> 00:46:30.840
Cameroon has over 200 languages and different ethnic groups,

651
00:46:31.419 --> 00:46:35.159
but when the national team plays, everybody is watching

652
00:46:35.159 --> 00:46:37.100
the game, and, and so there is a kind

653
00:46:37.100 --> 00:46:42.179
of national conversation. People rally behind their team. And

654
00:46:42.179 --> 00:46:45.590
in Europe, what we also see is that um

655
00:46:46.300 --> 00:46:50.949
the multicultural. The nation that has become a reality

656
00:46:50.949 --> 00:46:54.110
in most parts of, uh, of the world is

657
00:46:54.110 --> 00:46:58.239
really visible, uh, best visible on, on the pitch.

658
00:46:58.429 --> 00:47:02.159
So, uh, the French national team consists of people

659
00:47:02.159 --> 00:47:06.750
with, with, uh, all kinds of backgrounds from, uh,

660
00:47:06.760 --> 00:47:10.300
different parts of French African colonies from, uh, uh,

661
00:47:10.310 --> 00:47:15.060
but also from mireb immigrants, um. Uh, FROM a

662
00:47:15.060 --> 00:47:18.889
Basque background, all play for the French national team

663
00:47:18.889 --> 00:47:22.020
and, and so it is really the nation as

664
00:47:22.020 --> 00:47:25.419
the community of citizens that is really visible, uh,

665
00:47:25.459 --> 00:47:30.300
visible there, but there are also cases. Uh, HARDCORE

666
00:47:30.300 --> 00:47:33.520
Catalan nationalist one chair for the Spanish national team,

667
00:47:33.620 --> 00:47:34.600
for instance, uh,

668
00:47:35.060 --> 00:47:38.679
mhm, yeah, uh, tell us about the exceptions to

669
00:47:38.679 --> 00:47:44.260
the nation state model like the absolute monarchies of

670
00:47:44.260 --> 00:47:50.280
Saudi Arabia and Brunei or religiously defined states such

671
00:47:50.280 --> 00:47:54.620
as the Vatican City and the Islamic Emirate of

672
00:47:54.620 --> 00:47:55.419
Afghanistan.

673
00:47:55.979 --> 00:48:01.050
Yeah, so, so, um, uh, what one could argue

674
00:48:01.050 --> 00:48:04.090
is that, that the model of the nation-state really

675
00:48:04.090 --> 00:48:09.550
since the 1960s has become dominant. So almost all,

676
00:48:09.679 --> 00:48:13.750
uh, states that became independent adopted the nation-state model

677
00:48:14.090 --> 00:48:18.409
and this very contrary to the, the, uh, the,

678
00:48:18.489 --> 00:48:22.889
the ethnic or cultural model. So there are thousands

679
00:48:22.889 --> 00:48:26.780
of Uh, ethnic or linguistic communities that do not

680
00:48:26.780 --> 00:48:29.300
have their own state, uh, so this is not

681
00:48:29.300 --> 00:48:32.010
a reality. What is a reality is the adoption

682
00:48:32.010 --> 00:48:35.879
of the nation-state model, so the nation as citizens.

683
00:48:36.209 --> 00:48:39.620
Um, SO there are, there are only 4 exceptions

684
00:48:39.620 --> 00:48:41.860
in the world right now, and which, which is

685
00:48:41.860 --> 00:48:46.979
really, uh, incredible because the nation-state model only was

686
00:48:46.979 --> 00:48:50.455
invented 200. 50 years ago. So for, for a

687
00:48:50.455 --> 00:48:53.455
historian like, like I am, this is a very

688
00:48:53.455 --> 00:48:57.235
short period in the thousands of years of human

689
00:48:57.235 --> 00:49:01.514
history. We have empires for probably 10,000 years. We

690
00:49:01.514 --> 00:49:06.645
have kingdoms, we have tribal configurations. We have city-states.

691
00:49:08.479 --> 00:49:12.110
They, they exist for already thousands of years. But

692
00:49:12.110 --> 00:49:15.310
the nation state only appeared at a very late

693
00:49:15.310 --> 00:49:19.540
stage in human history, but really now has become

694
00:49:19.540 --> 00:49:22.590
the dominant form of statehood. And so what you

695
00:49:22.590 --> 00:49:27.510
see in Saudi Arabia is already women have received

696
00:49:27.510 --> 00:49:30.389
more equal rights over the last few years. There

697
00:49:30.389 --> 00:49:34.750
is a kind of consultative assembly, so they're slowly

698
00:49:34.750 --> 00:49:38.590
moving towards the nation state model as well, and

699
00:49:38.590 --> 00:49:42.500
I think if you would really ask. Have uh

700
00:49:42.500 --> 00:49:45.780
free elections in Afghanistan, then the people would, would

701
00:49:45.780 --> 00:49:51.219
prefer, uh, um, a, a constitutional system to, to

702
00:49:51.219 --> 00:49:54.010
their emirate, uh, probably.

703
00:49:54.649 --> 00:49:58.790
Yeah, and earlier you when we were talking about

704
00:49:58.790 --> 00:50:03.919
sports, you mentioned that uh there are nations like

705
00:50:03.919 --> 00:50:07.449
the Kurds and the Catalans that do not have

706
00:50:07.449 --> 00:50:11.250
their own state and so they are not recognized

707
00:50:11.250 --> 00:50:14.050
as such. What do you make of them?

708
00:50:15.360 --> 00:50:21.060
Um, YEAH, well, the, the, the, the idea of,

709
00:50:21.439 --> 00:50:26.010
um, A people with its own language, with its

710
00:50:26.010 --> 00:50:30.070
own culture, and therefore deserving to have its own

711
00:50:30.070 --> 00:50:33.270
state is still very much alive. And if you

712
00:50:33.270 --> 00:50:36.669
look at Catalonia and the Kurds, for instance, there

713
00:50:36.669 --> 00:50:42.469
are a considerable group of people. The Catalans, Catalonia,

714
00:50:42.520 --> 00:50:45.080
if it would become independent, would be a middle

715
00:50:45.080 --> 00:50:50.760
sized European country, similar also in wealth and population

716
00:50:50.760 --> 00:50:54.429
numbers like Finland or Austria, which are well recognized

717
00:50:54.429 --> 00:50:57.959
members of the European Union. So because they are

718
00:50:57.959 --> 00:51:01.179
not independent, they also do not have a seat

719
00:51:01.439 --> 00:51:06.100
in the European Union nor in the United Nations.

720
00:51:06.360 --> 00:51:08.719
So it's also a kind of frustration for them.

721
00:51:09.469 --> 00:51:11.729
But on the other hand, it is also quite

722
00:51:11.729 --> 00:51:16.120
paradoxical because a lot of Catalan speakers uh live

723
00:51:16.120 --> 00:51:19.360
outside of Catalonia, so the region of Valencia, for

724
00:51:19.360 --> 00:51:23.439
instance, uh, they speak a similar language with they

725
00:51:23.439 --> 00:51:26.919
probably define themselves as Valencian, but one could argue

726
00:51:26.919 --> 00:51:31.120
it's a, it's a form of Catalan, um. The

727
00:51:31.120 --> 00:51:34.239
Balearic Islands, uh, even in the south of France

728
00:51:34.239 --> 00:51:37.800
are, are Catalans, but it's not the, the Catalan

729
00:51:37.800 --> 00:51:42.439
people that demands independence. It was the region of

730
00:51:42.439 --> 00:51:47.280
the autonomous region of Catalonia that demanded independence, and

731
00:51:47.280 --> 00:51:52.000
there half of the population has Spanish as its

732
00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:56.280
first language, and moreover, almost all people in Catalonia

733
00:51:56.280 --> 00:52:01.330
are bilingual. Um, SO, so the. And in the

734
00:52:01.330 --> 00:52:05.649
case of the Kurds, um, it, it was the

735
00:52:05.649 --> 00:52:11.050
Kurdish region of within Iraq, an autonomous region within

736
00:52:11.050 --> 00:52:16.010
Iraq that had organized a referendum in 2017, and

737
00:52:16.010 --> 00:52:19.350
it were not the Kurds in Turkey or Syria

738
00:52:19.889 --> 00:52:24.189
or Or Iran that, that could participate. So here

739
00:52:24.189 --> 00:52:27.429
we also see that, that you need uh a

740
00:52:27.429 --> 00:52:32.129
kind of state or a provincial authorities in order

741
00:52:32.129 --> 00:52:36.209
to make yourself uh heard at the international stage

742
00:52:36.550 --> 00:52:40.459
and even then it's complicated because nobody recognized these

743
00:52:40.459 --> 00:52:42.610
independence uh uh referenda.

744
00:52:44.199 --> 00:52:48.139
So let's talk now a little bit about nationalism

745
00:52:48.360 --> 00:52:53.879
and its impact on current politics. So um how

746
00:52:53.879 --> 00:52:57.620
do you look at the current state of nationalism

747
00:52:57.620 --> 00:53:01.500
and in what ways does the rise of nationalism

748
00:53:01.840 --> 00:53:04.360
manifest itself worldwide?

749
00:53:05.540 --> 00:53:08.659
Yeah, so I think this is, this is uh

750
00:53:08.659 --> 00:53:12.300
very interesting because we all see that nationalism really

751
00:53:12.300 --> 00:53:16.979
is on the rise, especially among, uh, populist, right-wing,

752
00:53:17.340 --> 00:53:22.239
right-wing populists, um, and, and it's very exclusive culturally,

753
00:53:22.300 --> 00:53:27.909
uh, um. Uh, COLORED nationalism, so, so against foreigners,

754
00:53:27.989 --> 00:53:33.929
immigrants, um, emphasizing all kinds of cultural, uh, traditions,

755
00:53:34.350 --> 00:53:37.070
um, and I think what we see is on

756
00:53:37.070 --> 00:53:40.189
the one hand, the rise of neoliberalism which has

757
00:53:40.189 --> 00:53:44.909
really been the dominant ideology since the 1980s. This

758
00:53:44.909 --> 00:53:52.449
meant that, that many issues, um, economic issues. Disappeared

759
00:53:52.449 --> 00:53:55.810
from political debate because they were argued this is

760
00:53:55.810 --> 00:53:59.310
up to the markets, so there are not many

761
00:53:59.770 --> 00:54:06.429
political debates on the gap between rich and poor

762
00:54:06.429 --> 00:54:13.360
or raising pensions or Um, so these debates which

763
00:54:13.360 --> 00:54:17.379
were dominant in the 1950s and 1960s have become,

764
00:54:17.770 --> 00:54:22.040
uh, have, have largely disappeared from the political arena.

765
00:54:22.399 --> 00:54:24.919
And on the other hand, what has become much

766
00:54:24.919 --> 00:54:30.810
more important are identity issues. And so, um, uh,

767
00:54:31.350 --> 00:54:34.989
identity of the majority but also identity of all

768
00:54:34.989 --> 00:54:39.709
kinds of, uh, minorities. So identity politics really has

769
00:54:39.709 --> 00:54:42.310
become center stage in, in the political arena, in

770
00:54:42.310 --> 00:54:47.530
most parliaments, in most elections as well, um, and

771
00:54:47.590 --> 00:54:52.310
this has been strongly encouraged also by, uh, commercial

772
00:54:52.310 --> 00:54:58.080
media and especially the, um, Internet and social media.

773
00:54:58.270 --> 00:55:02.820
So the social media uh enterprises like Facebook, uh,

774
00:55:02.840 --> 00:55:07.639
uh, YouTube, uh, uh, Instagram, they want people to

775
00:55:07.639 --> 00:55:11.139
spend as much time as possible on their platforms

776
00:55:11.560 --> 00:55:14.560
and so what they do is their algorithms, they

777
00:55:14.560 --> 00:55:23.979
stimulate, um, Emotions, extreme opinions, extreme footage, so the

778
00:55:23.979 --> 00:55:28.080
stranger, the more outrageous the images or opinions are,

779
00:55:29.100 --> 00:55:32.020
the more they are stimulated on the social media

780
00:55:32.020 --> 00:55:38.239
and also on Um, commercial television stations in, in

781
00:55:38.239 --> 00:55:41.040
general, uh, and so what we see is a,

782
00:55:41.120 --> 00:55:46.399
is a very strong polarization, um, based largely on

783
00:55:46.399 --> 00:55:51.679
identity issues, um, and, and this very strongly this

784
00:55:51.679 --> 00:55:57.000
weakens centrist political parties and encourages, uh, very much

785
00:55:57.000 --> 00:56:01.550
political parties that focus on these identities issues, especially,

786
00:56:01.560 --> 00:56:05.919
uh, uh, uh, right-wing populists. Which came to power

787
00:56:05.919 --> 00:56:10.040
in Brazil with Bolsonaro, uh, uh, in, in Hungary

788
00:56:10.040 --> 00:56:13.709
with Orban, uh, in, in India with, uh, uh,

789
00:56:14.239 --> 00:56:17.760
Modi, and now, uh, uh, Trump in the United

790
00:56:17.760 --> 00:56:21.699
States is, is probably the, the best example. Um,

791
00:56:22.479 --> 00:56:25.709
SO, so we see a very, uh, different, um,

792
00:56:26.120 --> 00:56:29.879
different environment, uh, nowadays, and, and, yeah, it's kind

793
00:56:29.879 --> 00:56:31.379
of worrying now, I would say.

794
00:56:32.399 --> 00:56:35.129
And in the countries where there's been a rise

795
00:56:35.129 --> 00:56:41.889
of that kind of far right nationalist rhetoric, there's

796
00:56:41.889 --> 00:56:46.000
also been xenophobic incidents, right? I mean, and that's

797
00:56:46.000 --> 00:56:50.449
also a manifestation of nationalism taken to the extreme,

798
00:56:50.850 --> 00:56:54.620
correct. Yeah, yeah, that, that, that's certainly the case

799
00:56:54.620 --> 00:57:00.159
and uh um so, so right wing violence and,

800
00:57:00.199 --> 00:57:03.419
and, but, but also as we have seen in,

801
00:57:03.439 --> 00:57:06.739
in the United States, uh, there are also some.

802
00:57:07.459 --> 00:57:10.939
Uh, ISOLATED figures that, that take up their, their

803
00:57:10.939 --> 00:57:15.939
guns and, and try to kill right wing influencers,

804
00:57:16.020 --> 00:57:20.500
for instance. Uh, SO, so, uh, the atmosphere gets

805
00:57:20.500 --> 00:57:23.860
heated up and, and, um, yeah, this is not

806
00:57:23.860 --> 00:57:27.570
a very pleasant world anymore, um, and then the

807
00:57:27.570 --> 00:57:29.939
future does not look very bright, I would say.

808
00:57:31.500 --> 00:57:34.770
And so finally, I mean, still on the same

809
00:57:34.770 --> 00:57:37.989
topic, but this will be my final question. Uh,

810
00:57:38.050 --> 00:57:41.010
WHAT do you think about the recent guarding of

811
00:57:41.010 --> 00:57:45.129
national borders that in certain countries has been strengthened,

812
00:57:46.649 --> 00:57:49.830
especially against the entry of poor immigrants?

813
00:57:50.340 --> 00:57:53.139
Yeah, so, so what we see is that, that

814
00:57:53.139 --> 00:57:57.620
the xenophobic rhetoric is very much against poor immigrants,

815
00:57:57.729 --> 00:58:03.300
so expats and, and, um, um, rich people that

816
00:58:03.300 --> 00:58:06.419
buy a second home, for instance, are, are often

817
00:58:06.419 --> 00:58:10.800
still welcomed. But it's especially poor immigrants and, and

818
00:58:10.800 --> 00:58:15.560
they're associated, especially if they have different skin color

819
00:58:15.560 --> 00:58:18.439
of a different religion. So in Europe, it's, it's

820
00:58:18.439 --> 00:58:22.959
mostly anti-Muslim as well or anti-African, anti-black. In the

821
00:58:22.959 --> 00:58:27.120
United States, it's, it's mostly against the Hispanics, um.

822
00:58:27.550 --> 00:58:31.330
And so, um, this is what you see, so,

823
00:58:31.479 --> 00:58:36.399
so a kind of hostile, xenophobic reaction also from,

824
00:58:36.560 --> 00:58:39.750
from governments, uh, but the interesting thing is that

825
00:58:39.750 --> 00:58:43.560
we also see a kind of uh resurgence of

826
00:58:43.560 --> 00:58:50.800
imperial tendencies. So, um, Putin is extremely nationalist, but

827
00:58:50.800 --> 00:58:55.810
he also tries to, uh, conquer, um, uh, Ukraine.

828
00:58:56.409 --> 00:59:01.850
Um, Xi Jinping in China is also extremely nationalist,

829
00:59:02.030 --> 00:59:05.649
uh, but he also tries to create new islands

830
00:59:05.649 --> 00:59:12.209
in the South Chinese Sea, uh, and annexing territorial

831
00:59:12.209 --> 00:59:16.250
waters to the detriment of, of neighboring countries like

832
00:59:16.250 --> 00:59:20.870
Vietnam, the Philippines, and even Indonesia. So they're expanding,

833
00:59:21.090 --> 00:59:26.300
uh, uh, in the ocean. Uh, AND Trump, uh,

834
00:59:26.479 --> 00:59:30.919
is extremely nationalist, but he also claims the Panama

835
00:59:30.919 --> 00:59:35.290
Canal. He, he wants, Greenland, uh, he wants to

836
00:59:35.290 --> 00:59:38.830
add Canada to the United States even though a

837
00:59:38.830 --> 00:59:42.239
large part of the Canadians have French as their,

838
00:59:42.270 --> 00:59:47.370
uh, uh, national language, uh, so. So language and

839
00:59:47.370 --> 00:59:49.489
culture do not seem to matter. It, it is

840
00:59:49.489 --> 00:59:55.669
also um creating kind of new, new imperial states,

841
00:59:56.010 --> 01:00:01.360
um, where it's not. An international order existing of

842
01:00:01.360 --> 01:00:05.350
equal nation states that Where, where there still are

843
01:00:05.350 --> 01:00:08.629
power differences, but at least in the United Nations,

844
01:00:08.709 --> 01:00:12.530
in the General Assembly, every country has one vote,

845
01:00:12.909 --> 01:00:17.709
and it is the international order supposedly consists of

846
01:00:17.709 --> 01:00:21.604
equal partners that collaborate. To decide on the future

847
01:00:21.604 --> 01:00:24.445
of the world, but what we see lately is,

848
01:00:24.905 --> 01:00:28.625
uh, the law of the jungle, uh, might is

849
01:00:28.625 --> 01:00:32.824
right. The big powers, um, they take what they

850
01:00:32.824 --> 01:00:36.264
can get, or they impose their will, uh, what

851
01:00:36.264 --> 01:00:39.465
we see very clearly in the case of Trump

852
01:00:39.465 --> 01:00:44.064
and his tariff war, they impose their, their tariffs.

853
01:00:44.800 --> 01:00:49.270
Quite arbitrarily on, on countries around the world and

854
01:00:49.270 --> 01:00:53.570
small countries, for instance, in um in Europe, um.

855
01:00:54.439 --> 01:00:59.250
Switzerland got a tariff of I think 38%, uh,

856
01:01:00.280 --> 01:01:04.399
so the European Union, many countries complain that we

857
01:01:04.399 --> 01:01:08.199
now have a tariff of 15%, but Switzerland is

858
01:01:08.199 --> 01:01:11.520
alone and, and it's a, it's a puppet in

859
01:01:11.520 --> 01:01:13.879
the hands of Trump and, and so they have

860
01:01:13.879 --> 01:01:17.199
no negotiation power. So what we, what we see

861
01:01:17.199 --> 01:01:20.080
here very much is that the strong can, can

862
01:01:20.080 --> 01:01:23.290
impose their will on, on the weak. So we

863
01:01:23.290 --> 01:01:26.889
see a kind of new uh uh resurgence of

864
01:01:26.889 --> 01:01:31.409
imperial tendencies in, in a slightly different way and,

865
01:01:31.459 --> 01:01:35.290
and so geopolitics is, is, uh, is changing very

866
01:01:35.290 --> 01:01:38.290
fast. And the interesting thing is that many nationalist

867
01:01:38.290 --> 01:01:41.850
movements in Europe wanted to leave the European Union,

868
01:01:42.209 --> 01:01:45.770
but now they understand we need Europe to protect

869
01:01:45.770 --> 01:01:47.909
us against Trump in a sense.

870
01:01:48.770 --> 01:01:51.879
Right, and do you look at this as a

871
01:01:51.879 --> 01:01:56.659
worrying trend and something that could even get worse

872
01:01:56.659 --> 01:01:57.939
in the future?

873
01:01:58.439 --> 01:02:03.679
Yeah, so, so, um. I, I think the major

874
01:02:03.679 --> 01:02:07.600
threat to humanity nowadays is, is climate change and

875
01:02:07.600 --> 01:02:13.080
um for that we should cooperate harmoniously together as

876
01:02:13.080 --> 01:02:18.399
citizens of the world, um, but if imperialism is

877
01:02:18.399 --> 01:02:20.719
on the rise and, and in the case of

878
01:02:20.719 --> 01:02:25.679
Trump, there is no, he even ignores climate change

879
01:02:25.679 --> 01:02:30.320
and, and stimulates the oil industry and, and. And

880
01:02:30.320 --> 01:02:33.959
stops uh uh wind energy projects, so that is

881
01:02:33.959 --> 01:02:39.040
not very helpful and, and international collaboration uh does

882
01:02:39.040 --> 01:02:41.719
not really come off the ground this way.

883
01:02:42.750 --> 01:02:47.479
Mhm. OK, so let's wrap up the interview here

884
01:02:47.479 --> 01:02:51.120
then, Doctor Storm. The book is again Nationalism A

885
01:02:51.120 --> 01:02:54.840
World History, and of course leaving a link to

886
01:02:54.840 --> 01:02:57.840
it in the description of the interview. And would

887
01:02:57.840 --> 01:03:00.300
you like to tell people where they can find

888
01:03:00.300 --> 01:03:02.800
you and your work on the internet?

889
01:03:04.080 --> 01:03:07.110
Yeah, so, uh, uh, I have a personal website

890
01:03:07.110 --> 01:03:10.310
on the, uh, from my university, so, uh, and,

891
01:03:10.399 --> 01:03:12.860
and I have a lot of my publications also

892
01:03:12.860 --> 01:03:15.149
on the, on the web, so, uh, uh, but

893
01:03:15.149 --> 01:03:17.389
the book, the book should be available. There's a

894
01:03:17.389 --> 01:03:21.830
Spanish translation, uh, already, and there will be translations

895
01:03:21.830 --> 01:03:26.179
into Romanian and Bulgarian as well, uh, so probably,

896
01:03:26.189 --> 01:03:29.790
uh, we, hopefully we get more translations as well.

897
01:03:30.379 --> 01:03:32.929
Yeah, and I recommend it to everyone. I mean,

898
01:03:32.939 --> 01:03:35.979
