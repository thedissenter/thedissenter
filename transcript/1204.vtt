00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:03.089
Hello everyone. Welcome to a new episode of The

2
00:00:03.089 --> 00:00:05.900
Dissenter. I'm your host, as always, Ricardo Lops, and

3
00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:09.310
today I'm joined by Sarah Dierne. She's a PhD

4
00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:13.149
candidate in interpretation studies at the Department of Humanities

5
00:00:13.149 --> 00:00:16.590
at the University of Catania in Italy, where she

6
00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.940
collaborates with the chair of theoretical philosophy. And today

7
00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:25.040
we're going to talk about her book slash monograph

8
00:00:26.989 --> 00:00:30.569
Eil Nachereque Nochivolleva Storia Ehioria de Latinatalismo. Uh, uh,

9
00:00:30.579 --> 00:00:33.380
THAT'S the title in Italian. I mean, my translation

10
00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:36.900
is it's the Birth we didn't want History and

11
00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:40.889
theory of antenatalism. So, Sarah, welcome to the show.

12
00:00:40.939 --> 00:00:42.580
It's a huge pleasure to everyone.

13
00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.419
Thank you, thank you, Har Ricardo. Hi to all

14
00:00:46.419 --> 00:00:48.939
the listeners and thank you for the invitation.

15
00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:52.459
Of course, I mean, as I said, off record,

16
00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:55.860
uh, yours is one of my favorite books of

17
00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.340
2025, so I'm really happy to finally have you

18
00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.819
on the show. So let me start by asking

19
00:01:02.819 --> 00:01:05.660
you then, before we get into the actual content

20
00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:10.699
of your book slash monograph, what is Anti-atalism for

21
00:01:10.699 --> 00:01:15.620
you because I've noticed that probably different theorists, different

22
00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:20.660
philosophers, different people that are that identify as antenatalists

23
00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:24.769
have perhaps uh somewhat different conception of it. So

24
00:01:24.769 --> 00:01:27.260
what is your conception of antenatalism?

25
00:01:29.099 --> 00:01:32.620
I would say that anti-nativism for me is a

26
00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:40.540
kind of philosophical perspective where we try to understand

27
00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:45.779
what life is and we try to explain the

28
00:01:45.779 --> 00:01:50.660
reason for which. Not to be born, um, it

29
00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:54.940
should be uh preferable and for me it's a

30
00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:59.139
perspective that includes all living beings and I mean

31
00:01:59.139 --> 00:02:03.410
all sentient beings, but uh in my work I

32
00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:06.779
focus only on the human beings. I mean right

33
00:02:06.779 --> 00:02:10.740
now and uh yeah, this is a philosophical position

34
00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:14.300
I suppose, so it's the more uh the more

35
00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:16.380
general reply I can tell you.

36
00:02:17.169 --> 00:02:20.860
Yeah, I mean, so at least at this point

37
00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.360
you don't try to extend it to all sentient

38
00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:27.039
beings, is that it,

39
00:02:27.279 --> 00:02:31.839
right? Yes, because also in the type of research

40
00:02:31.839 --> 00:02:35.000
I'm doing right now, I'm trying to focus on

41
00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.744
the role of the consciousness, so. Yeah, this is

42
00:02:38.744 --> 00:02:42.645
the reason for which human beings are the focus

43
00:02:42.865 --> 00:02:47.304
also because it's more difficult, I suppose, to to

44
00:02:47.304 --> 00:02:54.244
find a way to pursue antiatist behavior in the

45
00:02:55.104 --> 00:02:58.184
in the sentient beings, but in the non-human beings.

46
00:02:59.009 --> 00:03:03.410
Sure, so what got you interested in anti-atalism? I

47
00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:07.110
mean, even as a philosopher, you could have gone

48
00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:11.470
through many different paths. I mean, philosophy basically includes

49
00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:17.089
everything out there in terms of intellectual pursuits, so

50
00:03:17.089 --> 00:03:18.509
why anti-natalism?

51
00:03:18.759 --> 00:03:20.940
Uh, THIS is a good question. I like it.

52
00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:25.580
I I have to I have to say that

53
00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:31.800
I always got interested with the suffering of human

54
00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:36.440
beings and when I started my career at the

55
00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:43.350
university, I started by discussing. With that condition, that

56
00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:47.669
particular situation where we have people who suffer from

57
00:03:47.669 --> 00:03:52.360
some disease, so the case of euthanasia, assisted suicide,

58
00:03:52.789 --> 00:03:58.910
because in my opinion they were they were that

59
00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:05.770
particular cases in which we We have to explain

60
00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:09.889
why not not being in the world, it would

61
00:04:09.889 --> 00:04:12.130
be preferable to be in the world than to

62
00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:15.550
be in the world in that situation. Then after

63
00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:19.790
the bachelor's degree, I got to know the atheism

64
00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:23.339
and I have to confess that it was quite

65
00:04:23.339 --> 00:04:27.820
uh uh randomly my because I read a paper

66
00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:32.320
of the professor who now is my supervisor and

67
00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:36.040
uh I read this paper on anti-nativism um in

68
00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:38.720
the same year, it was the 2020. I read

69
00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:42.890
the Italian translation of the Human Predicament uh by

70
00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:48.230
David Bennetter and uh yeah, I, I found uh

71
00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:53.089
in the 1880ism a way to. Discuss about the

72
00:04:53.089 --> 00:04:58.690
relation or the the the the the dialectics between

73
00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:01.809
the possibility of not being into the world and

74
00:05:01.809 --> 00:05:05.570
being to the world in a user perspective because

75
00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:09.609
it does not comprehend only that particular situation where

76
00:05:09.609 --> 00:05:14.250
we have the disease and some factual events, but

77
00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:19.279
we speak about suffering that. Um, THAT all of

78
00:05:19.279 --> 00:05:23.570
us, um, er, possess or, uh, a reason for

79
00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:25.649
suffer, so I mean it's a, a kind of

80
00:05:25.649 --> 00:05:28.510
more comprehensive philosophical position, I suppose.

81
00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:32.850
I mean, uh, just out of curiosity, is your

82
00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:39.390
supervisor Professor Buso? Yes. Oh, OK. I, I also

83
00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:43.170
like his work very much, so Giovanni Buso, yeah,

84
00:05:43.489 --> 00:05:45.690
yeah, yeah, yeah, I really like his work. So,

85
00:05:45.769 --> 00:05:49.429
uh, let, let me now get into the book

86
00:05:49.429 --> 00:05:53.109
slash monograph itself. So you start with the question

87
00:05:53.109 --> 00:05:58.065
of why does something exist rather than. Nothing since

88
00:05:58.065 --> 00:06:01.625
nothingness is simpler than being. I mean, why do

89
00:06:01.625 --> 00:06:05.704
you think it is important to start with metaphysics

90
00:06:05.704 --> 00:06:07.364
when talking about antenatal?

91
00:06:08.584 --> 00:06:13.864
Well, it's the perspective that I had on my

92
00:06:13.864 --> 00:06:17.804
book and then that I'm trying to deepen now.

93
00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:22.589
And as for the Leibniz question, I think that

94
00:06:22.589 --> 00:06:25.470
it is quite interesting because if we change this

95
00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:28.910
question and try to consider when we speak about

96
00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:31.989
nothing and being of the if we try to

97
00:06:31.989 --> 00:06:36.149
consider this question related to the human life, we

98
00:06:36.149 --> 00:06:41.225
can it becomes quite. Interesting because we have to

99
00:06:41.225 --> 00:06:45.184
understand why if nothing and so not to be

100
00:06:45.184 --> 00:06:50.825
into life it's easier, it's simple, it's less painful

101
00:06:50.825 --> 00:06:54.765
we are in the world why we continue existing

102
00:06:55.024 --> 00:06:59.684
and as for the metaphysical perspective, I think that.

103
00:07:01.359 --> 00:07:03.480
I mean, in my opinion, it's a kind of

104
00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:10.160
perspective that comes before the ethical issue because first

105
00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:12.320
of all we must understand what does it mean

106
00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:16.880
to be human, what does it life, and what

107
00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:22.429
is suffering, and as for my perspective, what is

108
00:07:22.429 --> 00:07:25.739
interesting of the metaphysical position is that we try

109
00:07:25.739 --> 00:07:32.000
to compare our Being into the world with the

110
00:07:33.149 --> 00:07:37.079
presence with the existence of the other beings and

111
00:07:37.269 --> 00:07:40.510
I mean it turns out that we have the

112
00:07:40.510 --> 00:07:44.309
existence is quite the same because also a rock,

113
00:07:44.429 --> 00:07:47.089
also the chair where I am now, it's going

114
00:07:47.089 --> 00:07:49.790
to be deleted by the time, but for men

115
00:07:49.790 --> 00:07:51.950
this is the reason of suffering for all sentient

116
00:07:51.950 --> 00:07:54.869
beings, but for humans this is the reason of

117
00:07:54.869 --> 00:07:58.579
suffering, this is the reason of pain and the

118
00:07:59.010 --> 00:08:02.730
The normal end of everything for man is death,

119
00:08:02.809 --> 00:08:07.619
and it's one of the main reasons of of

120
00:08:07.619 --> 00:08:10.820
suffering of troubles for human beings. So this is

121
00:08:10.820 --> 00:08:15.200
my perspective, and I think that the metaphysical position

122
00:08:15.700 --> 00:08:21.480
gives us the possibility to to speak about the

123
00:08:22.299 --> 00:08:26.290
meaning of birth, the meaning of being born, and

124
00:08:26.859 --> 00:08:30.500
on which basement we can build up all the

125
00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:34.719
ethical issue which derives from this knowledge.

126
00:08:35.648 --> 00:08:37.768
Uh, IT'S very interesting. I mean, it, it sort

127
00:08:37.768 --> 00:08:42.148
of reminds me of, uh, Kent and Schopenhauer where

128
00:08:42.528 --> 00:08:46.729
they start their philosophy with metaphysics and then go

129
00:08:46.729 --> 00:08:50.568
to epistemology, and only then they get into ethics.

130
00:08:50.909 --> 00:08:53.369
I mean, it's like we have to have an

131
00:08:53.369 --> 00:08:56.549
understanding of the world we're living in and what

132
00:08:56.549 --> 00:08:59.830
we can know about it and only then we

133
00:08:59.830 --> 00:09:03.150
can get into ethics. That, that's interesting. I, I

134
00:09:03.150 --> 00:09:05.809
mean, do you have that same sort of perspective?

135
00:09:06.429 --> 00:09:09.590
Yeah, I think that's my perspective is uh uh.

136
00:09:10.090 --> 00:09:13.580
Yeah, it goes in this direction because I think

137
00:09:13.580 --> 00:09:17.919
that like a kind of Socratics way, you know,

138
00:09:19.119 --> 00:09:21.599
if we know what is good and what is

139
00:09:21.599 --> 00:09:26.520
wrong, then we can be able to to adapt

140
00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:29.599
our behavior to that knowledge, and I think that.

141
00:09:29.849 --> 00:09:35.559
Anti-natalism, it's quite the same also because we have

142
00:09:36.159 --> 00:09:39.690
anti-natalism, it's not so common. It's a radical issue

143
00:09:39.909 --> 00:09:43.080
and first of all, I think it's important to

144
00:09:43.909 --> 00:09:47.669
to make this argument more clear. We can try

145
00:09:47.669 --> 00:09:52.510
to understand what are the reasons, and then we

146
00:09:52.510 --> 00:09:56.989
can discuss about the result, the behavior, the ethical

147
00:09:56.989 --> 00:10:01.030
issue like all. Uh, PROCREATION and so on.

148
00:10:02.059 --> 00:10:05.710
OK, so another important question here has to do

149
00:10:05.710 --> 00:10:10.429
with how we deal with living beings. So what

150
00:10:10.429 --> 00:10:15.150
separates the inorganic from the organic? How do you

151
00:10:15.150 --> 00:10:16.500
address that question?

152
00:10:17.250 --> 00:10:22.270
For me, there is no difference between the organic

153
00:10:22.270 --> 00:10:25.190
and inorganic. I mean, on the one hand, of

154
00:10:25.190 --> 00:10:28.020
course they are different. There are two different ways

155
00:10:28.020 --> 00:10:34.049
in which the matter. Um, GOES to individuate and

156
00:10:34.049 --> 00:10:39.210
the individuation in a Schopenhauer's sense, but I think

157
00:10:39.210 --> 00:10:41.429
that it's only a question of difference. I mean,

158
00:10:41.450 --> 00:10:46.700
it's um. There is no privilege. There is no

159
00:10:47.599 --> 00:10:55.520
evolution, and I think that the similarity there are

160
00:10:55.520 --> 00:10:59.739
many similarities. For example, the example of the desk,

161
00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:04.840
the desk starts and it's an existent being that

162
00:11:04.840 --> 00:11:07.239
starts and go to finish and the same we

163
00:11:07.239 --> 00:11:10.479
can say for life. It starts and it finishes.

164
00:11:10.590 --> 00:11:13.710
Like all the existent beings, but for life this

165
00:11:13.710 --> 00:11:15.590
is the reason of pain and this is the

166
00:11:15.590 --> 00:11:19.309
reason I mean we call the beginning moment therefore

167
00:11:19.309 --> 00:11:26.109
we call the ending moment death. So and we

168
00:11:26.109 --> 00:11:28.750
leave all this period between the beginning and the

169
00:11:28.750 --> 00:11:32.830
end as a reason of pain, but apart from

170
00:11:32.830 --> 00:11:36.429
that, I think that they represent only two different

171
00:11:36.429 --> 00:11:37.909
ways of the matter.

172
00:11:38.559 --> 00:11:44.510
Mhm, YES, um, tell us about the ontocentric paradigm

173
00:11:44.609 --> 00:11:47.210
you bring into your book and how does it

174
00:11:47.210 --> 00:11:50.890
differ from an anthropocentric paradigm.

175
00:11:51.340 --> 00:11:58.150
Yeah, it's the, I call the ontocientic paradigm, the

176
00:11:58.150 --> 00:12:02.950
paradigm that in my perspective can be interesting to

177
00:12:02.950 --> 00:12:08.869
pursue because we have a kind of relation between

178
00:12:08.869 --> 00:12:12.229
the being of the living being and the huge

179
00:12:12.229 --> 00:12:19.043
being, so we can discuss about life. Considering life

180
00:12:19.043 --> 00:12:22.163
from the inner side as in the more maybe

181
00:12:22.163 --> 00:12:27.293
anthropocentric position, but we try to understand life from

182
00:12:27.293 --> 00:12:32.163
a perspective in which we understand what is life

183
00:12:32.163 --> 00:12:36.143
and to confront it, to compare it with, as

184
00:12:36.143 --> 00:12:40.023
I said, the other existing beings so we can.

185
00:12:41.366 --> 00:12:45.966
Yeah, we can see life in in this um

186
00:12:46.656 --> 00:12:50.015
I mean within the nature and to discover that

187
00:12:50.015 --> 00:12:54.976
it's not so easy as the presence of the

188
00:12:54.976 --> 00:12:59.616
other beings and uh all the uh question, all

189
00:12:59.616 --> 00:13:05.495
the concept that I try to uh to discuss

190
00:13:05.495 --> 00:13:05.916
so far.

191
00:13:06.950 --> 00:13:11.059
Mhm. Uh, TELL us about the event of being

192
00:13:11.059 --> 00:13:14.119
born. I mean, and I guess that this is

193
00:13:14.119 --> 00:13:19.090
also relevant to other kinds of ethical questions like

194
00:13:19.090 --> 00:13:22.919
questions related to reproductive ethics and abortion and so

195
00:13:22.919 --> 00:13:26.030
on. I mean, we, we maybe, maybe we'll get

196
00:13:26.030 --> 00:13:29.039
into that later, but what is it to be

197
00:13:29.039 --> 00:13:33.000
born and how should this question be approached?

198
00:13:33.359 --> 00:13:38.390
Well, uh, I think that uh uh being born

199
00:13:38.390 --> 00:13:41.549
we can have different replies and it depends on

200
00:13:41.549 --> 00:13:45.950
uh how we we we want to deal with

201
00:13:45.950 --> 00:13:50.409
this um with this question with this topic because

202
00:13:50.669 --> 00:13:54.349
for example if we consider the position of some

203
00:13:54.349 --> 00:13:59.270
philosopher, I'm thinking to uh Hanna Har and uh

204
00:13:59.390 --> 00:14:03.414
for. This woman being born, it means it's open

205
00:14:03.414 --> 00:14:06.195
to the future, so maybe it represents a new

206
00:14:06.195 --> 00:14:09.755
beginning if we consider the biological perspective, it is

207
00:14:09.755 --> 00:14:14.715
only the the born of a new self that

208
00:14:14.715 --> 00:14:18.075
then is going to evolve and so on. I

209
00:14:18.075 --> 00:14:21.575
think that so there is no one reply. I

210
00:14:21.575 --> 00:14:24.690
mean it depends on the. Perspective, I can say

211
00:14:24.690 --> 00:14:29.849
that for me being born is the coming into

212
00:14:29.849 --> 00:14:33.479
the world of a new living being and if

213
00:14:33.479 --> 00:14:36.409
we want to consider the sentence and human being,

214
00:14:36.489 --> 00:14:39.849
it's the coming into the world of humans that

215
00:14:40.059 --> 00:14:46.080
That goes to suffer, that goes to start and

216
00:14:46.650 --> 00:14:49.059
to start his life and that goes to end

217
00:14:49.059 --> 00:14:54.239
it and who leave this period with pain, anger,

218
00:14:55.059 --> 00:15:01.309
suffering, and Yeah, but I think that from my

219
00:15:01.309 --> 00:15:08.210
metaphysical perspective before any ethical issue like reproduction, procreation,

220
00:15:08.270 --> 00:15:11.789
and yeah, it's the simple coming into the world

221
00:15:11.789 --> 00:15:12.830
of a new beings.

222
00:15:13.590 --> 00:15:15.469
Let me ask you this, do you think we

223
00:15:15.469 --> 00:15:22.150
are really predisposed biologically to wanting children or simply

224
00:15:22.150 --> 00:15:27.349
predisposed to wanting sex? Because for me it's not,

225
00:15:27.359 --> 00:15:31.280
uh, clear at all, and I'm not convinced that

226
00:15:31.669 --> 00:15:36.460
we really want to have children biologically. I mean

227
00:15:36.460 --> 00:15:41.020
that we have to learn culturally from other people

228
00:15:41.020 --> 00:15:45.780
first we have to associate having sex with reproduction

229
00:15:45.780 --> 00:15:49.179
and children uh and then we we also have

230
00:15:49.179 --> 00:15:52.179
to learn that uh I mean perhaps we should

231
00:15:52.179 --> 00:15:55.979
want to reproduce instead of just wanting to have

232
00:15:55.979 --> 00:15:59.179
sex. So what is your perspective on that?

233
00:16:00.809 --> 00:16:04.849
Uh, MAYBE I changed the verb. I will say

234
00:16:04.849 --> 00:16:08.570
that we are not predisposed to want children or

235
00:16:08.570 --> 00:16:12.770
want sex, but we are, uh, we are predisposed

236
00:16:12.770 --> 00:16:15.570
to have sex and children. I mean, for me

237
00:16:15.570 --> 00:16:21.690
it's. I think that it's natural our bodies are

238
00:16:21.690 --> 00:16:25.809
predisposed to have children. It's a biological way of

239
00:16:25.809 --> 00:16:29.450
living things and we are predisposed to have sex

240
00:16:29.450 --> 00:16:32.440
and also this is a biological way in which

241
00:16:32.440 --> 00:16:38.869
our body is structured, so I think that there

242
00:16:38.869 --> 00:16:43.950
is more biology than we can imagine, but I

243
00:16:43.950 --> 00:16:51.000
would say also that the difference is that Men

244
00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:55.619
as the human beings as the possibility to understand

245
00:16:55.619 --> 00:16:59.479
this biological way and to stop it, to decide

246
00:16:59.479 --> 00:17:03.659
to to control, to understand and to ask why

247
00:17:03.659 --> 00:17:07.180
we have to, we need to have children, why

248
00:17:08.319 --> 00:17:13.229
we can distinguish between sex and having children. I

249
00:17:13.229 --> 00:17:15.920
mean, for example, for the animal, but it's my

250
00:17:15.920 --> 00:17:20.790
opinion. I'm not I'm not so sure. I think

251
00:17:20.790 --> 00:17:23.750
that there is no there is not this difference

252
00:17:23.750 --> 00:17:27.430
between sex and er er reproduction. So I mean

253
00:17:27.430 --> 00:17:30.619
maybe we are able to understand the difference because

254
00:17:30.630 --> 00:17:35.109
of the, um, you know, the, the, the dialectics

255
00:17:35.109 --> 00:17:38.790
between nature and culture. So maybe because of the

256
00:17:38.790 --> 00:17:42.109
culture we are able to understand, but first of

257
00:17:42.109 --> 00:17:45.229
all I think that it's all uh biological structure

258
00:17:45.229 --> 00:17:46.329
of our body.

259
00:17:47.650 --> 00:17:49.930
Yeah, that, that's, that's interesting. I, I mean, I

260
00:17:49.930 --> 00:17:53.619
guess that, of course, uh many times we hear

261
00:17:53.619 --> 00:18:00.239
people justifying uh their reproduction, them having children, uh,

262
00:18:00.250 --> 00:18:04.729
by way of it being just a biological predisposition

263
00:18:04.729 --> 00:18:08.369
or even uh some, some sort of biological imperative,

264
00:18:08.449 --> 00:18:11.180
but I mean, uh, I think that's a, a

265
00:18:11.180 --> 00:18:15.125
really weak argument from a ethical perspective because if

266
00:18:15.125 --> 00:18:18.564
we're going to justify reproduction on the basis of

267
00:18:18.564 --> 00:18:22.724
having sort of a reproductive drive then there are

268
00:18:22.724 --> 00:18:27.324
many things we are biologically predisposed to even things

269
00:18:27.324 --> 00:18:31.925
that are violent uh that uh we shouldn't justify

270
00:18:31.925 --> 00:18:36.244
just on the basis of us having those uh

271
00:18:36.244 --> 00:18:38.925
predispositions or those drives right.

272
00:18:39.589 --> 00:18:42.270
Yeah, I mean, I agree with you. I think

273
00:18:42.270 --> 00:18:46.589
that to say that we are biologically predisposed does

274
00:18:46.589 --> 00:18:50.150
not mean that we must do it. We have

275
00:18:50.150 --> 00:18:55.910
this will to live which we cannot control sometimes

276
00:18:55.910 --> 00:19:00.119
I. Also noticed that this is one of the

277
00:19:00.119 --> 00:19:04.180
more common reply that people use to criticize the

278
00:19:04.180 --> 00:19:07.489
internet list, but I mean it's it's also the

279
00:19:07.489 --> 00:19:12.599
most easy maybe we now we have the knowledge,

280
00:19:12.640 --> 00:19:17.400
we have the possibility to understand what is reproduction,

281
00:19:17.479 --> 00:19:21.660
what does it mean, and also I. I mean

282
00:19:21.750 --> 00:19:28.930
the biological, the biological structure does not exclude that

283
00:19:28.930 --> 00:19:32.739
we are, we are, we receive the influence from

284
00:19:32.739 --> 00:19:38.670
the society or the normal evolution of life, you

285
00:19:38.670 --> 00:19:42.670
know, we are like, OK, we grew up, we

286
00:19:42.670 --> 00:19:45.670
got married, we got to have a family, and

287
00:19:46.390 --> 00:19:50.589
There are some kind of cultural influences that I

288
00:19:50.589 --> 00:19:52.229
think influences our decision.

289
00:19:53.089 --> 00:19:58.239
Yes, sure. Uh, DOES antenatalism have anything to say

290
00:19:58.239 --> 00:19:59.439
about abortion?

291
00:20:02.260 --> 00:20:07.910
Yes, I would say that antenatalism deal and may

292
00:20:07.910 --> 00:20:12.510
deal with the abortion, but because of course we

293
00:20:12.510 --> 00:20:16.270
are considering a practice to stop procreation, to stop,

294
00:20:16.390 --> 00:20:21.790
but when there is something that is not a

295
00:20:21.790 --> 00:20:27.300
new living being in like an existing being, but

296
00:20:27.579 --> 00:20:31.540
Yeah, I think that it may deal with this

297
00:20:31.540 --> 00:20:35.699
topic, but I think it's a second step because

298
00:20:35.699 --> 00:20:37.979
first of all we have to consider what does

299
00:20:37.979 --> 00:20:40.660
it mean to the problem of life. Then we

300
00:20:40.660 --> 00:20:45.369
can consider all these ethical other issues that we

301
00:20:45.369 --> 00:20:50.810
can we can adopt, we can take to to

302
00:20:50.819 --> 00:20:51.839
find a solution.

303
00:20:52.410 --> 00:20:56.550
Mhm. And what would you say are the harms

304
00:20:56.560 --> 00:21:00.170
brought about by life? I mean, just by being

305
00:21:00.170 --> 00:21:05.469
born, by living, what harms are we exposed to?

306
00:21:06.010 --> 00:21:10.010
Uh, WELL, uh, I mean, uh, yeah, this is

307
00:21:10.010 --> 00:21:13.930
a good question, but because, um, uh, I, I

308
00:21:13.930 --> 00:21:18.500
think that, uh, uh, we cannot, uh, uh. Find

309
00:21:18.989 --> 00:21:25.439
any objective suffering. I think that the simple fact

310
00:21:25.439 --> 00:21:29.959
that we are alive, it means that we will

311
00:21:29.959 --> 00:21:34.319
suffer for something, and the reasons for suffering are

312
00:21:34.319 --> 00:21:41.099
different. Maybe I would say that. If I consider

313
00:21:41.099 --> 00:21:48.020
some um some um Features that are intrinsic in

314
00:21:48.020 --> 00:21:51.540
every life we can speak about the role of

315
00:21:51.540 --> 00:21:54.819
the consciousness and I'm trying to focus on the

316
00:21:54.819 --> 00:21:59.459
role of the time and to discover or try

317
00:21:59.459 --> 00:22:04.859
to understand in which way. The meaning of time

318
00:22:04.859 --> 00:22:07.660
can be a reason of pain for human beings

319
00:22:07.660 --> 00:22:09.900
because we are aware of time, so the time

320
00:22:09.900 --> 00:22:14.900
will pass and it means the loss of something.

321
00:22:15.030 --> 00:22:18.650
So maybe I would say that this can be

322
00:22:18.650 --> 00:22:24.640
too. Two features of suffering for human beings and

323
00:22:24.640 --> 00:22:27.939
uh yeah, but for human beings, only for human

324
00:22:27.939 --> 00:22:31.209
beings I mean I would say, and because there

325
00:22:31.209 --> 00:22:40.609
are some structural structural structural features that that that

326
00:22:40.609 --> 00:22:42.489
comes with every new life.

327
00:22:43.229 --> 00:22:46.229
Mhm. Yeah, do, do you think that, I mean,

328
00:22:46.319 --> 00:22:50.280
when it comes to the harms and the good

329
00:22:50.280 --> 00:22:52.959
as the positive aspects of life, do you think

330
00:22:52.959 --> 00:22:59.300
that we can evaluate that objectively since different people

331
00:22:59.520 --> 00:23:04.135
have. Different perspectives on what happens to them and

332
00:23:04.135 --> 00:23:07.905
deal with what happens to them, good and bad

333
00:23:08.175 --> 00:23:10.494
in different ways. I mean, do you think we

334
00:23:10.494 --> 00:23:15.694
can evaluate that objectively or only subjectively.

335
00:23:17.140 --> 00:23:22.880
Ah I would say only subjective, but because I

336
00:23:22.880 --> 00:23:27.540
mean each person has his own reason to suffer

337
00:23:28.020 --> 00:23:32.479
and the stuff, the situation that make me sad

338
00:23:32.479 --> 00:23:35.040
are not the same that make you sad, but

339
00:23:35.439 --> 00:23:38.589
I cannot evaluate and compare my suffering with your

340
00:23:38.589 --> 00:23:43.069
suffering. I think that we can only, we can

341
00:23:43.069 --> 00:23:46.280
only we agree only on the fact that we

342
00:23:46.280 --> 00:23:48.900
suffer for something. Yeah,

343
00:23:49.140 --> 00:23:49.250
yeah,

344
00:23:49.300 --> 00:23:50.760
in a formal way, maybe,

345
00:23:51.680 --> 00:23:55.619
mhm, and uh I mean how does the reality

346
00:23:55.619 --> 00:23:59.939
of death frame life itself? I mean the fact

347
00:23:59.939 --> 00:24:03.739
that we are inevitably going to die, what sort

348
00:24:03.739 --> 00:24:07.739
of implications does that have for our lives as

349
00:24:07.739 --> 00:24:08.760
human beings?

350
00:24:11.010 --> 00:24:17.380
I think that we must distinguish between death as

351
00:24:17.380 --> 00:24:21.270
the act of dying and death as something which

352
00:24:21.270 --> 00:24:24.859
is which comes with life, and I try to

353
00:24:24.859 --> 00:24:29.619
do this to make this distinction because in my,

354
00:24:29.859 --> 00:24:32.780
if we speak about death as the last moment,

355
00:24:32.900 --> 00:24:37.079
the act of dying. I mean, I quite agree

356
00:24:37.079 --> 00:24:39.839
with Epicurus. I'm not sure that it's so painful

357
00:24:39.839 --> 00:24:43.839
because we are going to, to, I mean we

358
00:24:43.839 --> 00:24:48.349
are alive, so we cannot, we still are here

359
00:24:48.349 --> 00:24:51.880
and we don't experience death, but I would say

360
00:24:51.880 --> 00:24:55.630
that. It's the act of passing away, but there

361
00:24:55.630 --> 00:25:01.310
is another way to to understand maybe death, which

362
00:25:01.310 --> 00:25:05.660
is more painful for beings, for human beings, and

363
00:25:05.660 --> 00:25:09.900
is the type of death that's like a process,

364
00:25:10.150 --> 00:25:13.140
so that. Kind of death that comes with life.

365
00:25:13.260 --> 00:25:16.579
So from from the first moment we are into

366
00:25:16.579 --> 00:25:18.780
the world, we start to live, we start to

367
00:25:18.780 --> 00:25:23.739
die because each moment we lost something that does

368
00:25:23.739 --> 00:25:26.060
not come back anymore. So I think that in

369
00:25:26.060 --> 00:25:31.459
this way it's it frames in some way the

370
00:25:31.459 --> 00:25:37.760
life because it's something that that comes with our.

371
00:25:38.079 --> 00:25:42.040
Uh, WITH, with our life, each time we, we

372
00:25:42.040 --> 00:25:43.680
experience the loss of something.

373
00:25:44.339 --> 00:25:48.260
Mhm. So this is something that you've already touched

374
00:25:48.260 --> 00:25:52.979
on a little bit earlier, but is intelligence or

375
00:25:52.979 --> 00:25:58.219
some of our other psychological traits something that makes

376
00:25:58.219 --> 00:26:03.380
humans special in comparison to other animals, particularly when

377
00:26:03.380 --> 00:26:08.010
it comes to how we approach existential questions.

378
00:26:10.530 --> 00:26:14.619
Uh, I can, uh, I can, uh, give you

379
00:26:14.619 --> 00:26:17.439
to reply. The first one is, is not mine.

380
00:26:17.739 --> 00:26:21.640
Uh, IT'S um. There is one of the moralists

381
00:26:21.640 --> 00:26:25.040
Saul Leopardin in which he said that human beings

382
00:26:25.040 --> 00:26:28.410
are perfect but perfect in imperfection, and I would

383
00:26:28.410 --> 00:26:32.170
say that if we consider the intelligence as a

384
00:26:32.170 --> 00:26:34.810
kind of privilege of human beings, we can say

385
00:26:34.810 --> 00:26:38.959
that this privilege is a privilege in imperfection because

386
00:26:38.959 --> 00:26:45.089
of the suffering that intelligence as in the sense

387
00:26:45.089 --> 00:26:50.069
of being aware it's. It involves for for human

388
00:26:50.069 --> 00:26:53.369
beings in this regard, I'm quite, I quite agree

389
00:26:53.369 --> 00:26:57.430
with Peter Bessel's position, but on the other hand,

390
00:26:57.599 --> 00:27:03.400
I would say that. There is no privilege because

391
00:27:03.400 --> 00:27:08.599
intelligence, it's the way in which human beings adapt,

392
00:27:08.719 --> 00:27:13.319
adapt themselves, adapt themselves into the world like the

393
00:27:13.319 --> 00:27:18.520
animal has its own way to adapt and to

394
00:27:18.520 --> 00:27:22.579
survive. I think that intelligence is only the way

395
00:27:22.579 --> 00:27:25.800
in which human beings can survive into the world.

396
00:27:26.599 --> 00:27:29.030
So I mean it's a kind of evolution maybe,

397
00:27:29.209 --> 00:27:32.130
but uh I think that there is no privilege

398
00:27:32.130 --> 00:27:33.510
for uh for it.

399
00:27:34.069 --> 00:27:38.569
Mhm. Why do you think in your understanding, why

400
00:27:38.569 --> 00:27:43.189
is it that anti-natalism tends to get rejected by

401
00:27:43.189 --> 00:27:44.089
most people?

402
00:27:47.069 --> 00:27:51.989
For many reasons, uh, I mean, um, it's time

403
00:27:51.989 --> 00:27:56.989
that some people reject some of my perspective when

404
00:27:56.989 --> 00:27:59.869
we are also in a conversation. First of all,

405
00:27:59.949 --> 00:28:04.030
I always think that I have to consider that

406
00:28:04.030 --> 00:28:07.829
the people who reply to me is the people

407
00:28:07.829 --> 00:28:13.449
who, who is alive and so he considered the

408
00:28:13.449 --> 00:28:19.170
at least. Result and solution and the meaning of

409
00:28:19.170 --> 00:28:24.890
anti-nalism from the perspective of A living being who

410
00:28:24.890 --> 00:28:31.489
exists and who wants wants to continue to exist.

411
00:28:32.089 --> 00:28:34.520
So I think that uh this is one of

412
00:28:34.520 --> 00:28:38.560
the one of the features that we can we

413
00:28:38.560 --> 00:28:42.280
must maybe not we can, we must take into

414
00:28:42.280 --> 00:28:45.880
account when we we we speak, we try to

415
00:28:45.880 --> 00:28:49.560
understand the reason of the uh this um rejection.

416
00:28:50.119 --> 00:28:54.010
At the same time, I would say that it's

417
00:28:54.010 --> 00:28:56.349
not only a question, it's not only a problem

418
00:28:56.349 --> 00:29:01.689
of the acceptance, but I mean maybe it's it's

419
00:29:01.689 --> 00:29:06.170
also a problem of understanding. I'm not so sure

420
00:29:06.170 --> 00:29:10.310
that 18 is so easy to understand for people

421
00:29:10.689 --> 00:29:16.050
and because they they have their own perception of

422
00:29:16.050 --> 00:29:19.849
life, their evaluation of life, so I'm not so

423
00:29:19.849 --> 00:29:25.069
sure that such a huge and radical perspective can

424
00:29:25.069 --> 00:29:29.359
be. Yeah, if they can understand, I mean when

425
00:29:29.359 --> 00:29:32.520
I say that, but it is a philanthropic position

426
00:29:32.520 --> 00:29:35.660
for because it concerns with the suffering of human

427
00:29:35.660 --> 00:29:38.780
beings, most of them seem quite shocked. I mean,

428
00:29:38.839 --> 00:29:41.920
we are speaking about the preference of not being

429
00:29:41.920 --> 00:29:45.380
born and you see that it's philanthropic, but yes.

430
00:29:46.500 --> 00:29:48.939
Yeah, I, I mean, I guess that there's many

431
00:29:48.939 --> 00:29:52.339
things here, many complications. First of all, it's like

432
00:29:52.339 --> 00:29:56.579
going against uh some of our biological impulses, right?

433
00:29:56.819 --> 00:29:59.979
Because I mean, people think that it's, it's just

434
00:29:59.979 --> 00:30:03.339
normal, it's just to be expected to have children

435
00:30:03.339 --> 00:30:06.540
to reproduce, and then we also live in cultures.

436
00:30:06.619 --> 00:30:09.300
I mean, I don't think there's any culture out

437
00:30:09.300 --> 00:30:13.175
there that is anti-atalist. I mean, all. Cultures are

438
00:30:13.175 --> 00:30:17.295
pro-natalist because otherwise they wouldn't even be around. I

439
00:30:17.295 --> 00:30:21.094
mean, an anti-natalist culture seem over time people who

440
00:30:21.094 --> 00:30:24.074
were part of that culture would simply go extinct

441
00:30:24.295 --> 00:30:26.535
and then I mean I guess it would be

442
00:30:26.535 --> 00:30:29.375
the end of an anti-natalist culture, but, uh, and,

443
00:30:29.454 --> 00:30:32.084
and then there's also the fact that we are

444
00:30:32.084 --> 00:30:36.275
already living, we, we already exist, we already have

445
00:30:36.444 --> 00:30:40.609
an investment. Uh, IN this life and so I

446
00:30:40.609 --> 00:30:43.849
mean it's trying to ask people if it would

447
00:30:43.849 --> 00:30:47.530
have been better for them to never have been

448
00:30:47.530 --> 00:30:51.530
born, it's it at least for most people it

449
00:30:51.530 --> 00:30:54.530
sounds similar to asking them if you, if it

450
00:30:54.530 --> 00:30:58.079
would be better for them to be dead, right?

451
00:30:58.089 --> 00:31:01.569
I mean, because they associate the, uh, the first

452
00:31:01.569 --> 00:31:05.694
sort of non-existence with. The second sort that comes

453
00:31:05.694 --> 00:31:08.045
after they've already existed,

454
00:31:08.405 --> 00:31:13.604
right? Yeah, yeah, I totally agree and also because

455
00:31:13.604 --> 00:31:20.125
I think that most of us maybe fortunately I

456
00:31:20.125 --> 00:31:26.505
would say we were able to build our life

457
00:31:26.505 --> 00:31:30.680
in a way where we can. Balance the suffering

458
00:31:30.680 --> 00:31:34.619
with the pleasure or the our project, so maybe

459
00:31:34.920 --> 00:31:37.569
um and also I think that the presence of

460
00:31:37.569 --> 00:31:42.819
project of aim of meaning helps helps us to

461
00:31:43.119 --> 00:31:45.800
to go in a direction so that move that

462
00:31:45.800 --> 00:31:49.010
move us on so we can continue living and

463
00:31:49.010 --> 00:31:53.390
we have a. AN aim we want to pursue

464
00:31:53.390 --> 00:31:56.229
that meaning, that result, and then go and go,

465
00:31:56.339 --> 00:31:59.150
and this is the way in which the life

466
00:32:00.109 --> 00:32:03.489
flow and go until it ends.

467
00:32:03.829 --> 00:32:08.020
OK, so as antenatalists we many times use arguments

468
00:32:08.020 --> 00:32:11.670
based on suffering, right, that it's inevitable that when

469
00:32:11.670 --> 00:32:14.670
a new being, a new human being is brought

470
00:32:14.670 --> 00:32:18.762
into existence, he or She will suffer inevitably. I

471
00:32:18.762 --> 00:32:21.883
mean, in different ways, different people suffer in different

472
00:32:21.883 --> 00:32:24.902
ways, but, uh, suffering is inevitable. But, but, but

473
00:32:24.902 --> 00:32:28.762
that kind of argument for most people or many

474
00:32:28.762 --> 00:32:33.262
people at least is not uh convincing enough because

475
00:32:33.642 --> 00:32:37.003
they, they also suffer. They know that they suffer,

476
00:32:37.083 --> 00:32:40.363
but they can give meaning to their own suffering

477
00:32:40.363 --> 00:32:43.123
and they don't think that is a good enough.

478
00:32:43.336 --> 00:32:47.735
Argument to uh prevent them from reproducing because they

479
00:32:47.735 --> 00:32:52.416
think that new people through their meaning systems, I

480
00:32:52.416 --> 00:32:54.855
don't know, it can be through religion, it can

481
00:32:54.855 --> 00:33:01.286
be through some sort of um secularist um uh

482
00:33:01.355 --> 00:33:05.375
uh uh some sort of secularist belief system they

483
00:33:05.375 --> 00:33:08.926
can uh give meaning to their suffering,

484
00:33:09.316 --> 00:33:15.119
right. OK, OK, now it's clear, yeah, yes, but

485
00:33:15.439 --> 00:33:18.160
also in this case I would reply that we

486
00:33:18.160 --> 00:33:22.020
cannot, I mean, OK, for us maybe we can,

487
00:33:22.319 --> 00:33:24.800
I will reply to these people, maybe for us

488
00:33:24.800 --> 00:33:28.800
it's OK, we can uh we can consider suffering

489
00:33:28.800 --> 00:33:31.199
something bad but not so bad that we should

490
00:33:31.199 --> 00:33:33.900
prevent from to bring other people into the world.

491
00:33:34.680 --> 00:33:36.880
It's OK, but we cannot decide for the other

492
00:33:36.880 --> 00:33:40.599
people because for us suffering is not so painful,

493
00:33:40.680 --> 00:33:44.229
it's not so harmful, and we can balance it

494
00:33:44.229 --> 00:33:47.439
with the rest of our life, but we are

495
00:33:47.439 --> 00:33:49.640
not sure that it will be the same for

496
00:33:49.640 --> 00:33:53.199
the other people. But because, of course we don't

497
00:33:53.199 --> 00:33:56.800
know the life they are going to live, and

498
00:33:56.800 --> 00:33:59.439
we are. I mean we are not them. Maybe

499
00:33:59.439 --> 00:34:02.969
the as I said before, we, I can suffer

500
00:34:02.969 --> 00:34:05.020
for something that for you is not reason of

501
00:34:05.020 --> 00:34:09.438
suffering, and we cannot know what the way they

502
00:34:09.659 --> 00:34:13.199
they deal with suffering. I think that it's quite

503
00:34:13.199 --> 00:34:16.899
selfish to think, yeah, for me, suffering is not

504
00:34:16.899 --> 00:34:20.500
strong enough. We can we can bring someone else

505
00:34:20.500 --> 00:34:23.219
into the world and we will be present and.

506
00:34:23.719 --> 00:34:27.719
We will be there for helping him, OK, all

507
00:34:27.719 --> 00:34:31.958
good, all nice, but we cannot be sure that

508
00:34:31.958 --> 00:34:34.840
for the people who who is into the world,

509
00:34:34.929 --> 00:34:36.780
it's OK and uh.

510
00:34:38.449 --> 00:34:40.850
Yeah, I, I mean, I mean, I actually think

511
00:34:40.850 --> 00:34:44.810
that the argument based on risk that there's a

512
00:34:44.810 --> 00:34:47.929
risk that the, the person you're going to bring

513
00:34:47.929 --> 00:34:52.889
into the world will not like their life, will

514
00:34:52.889 --> 00:34:57.489
suffer beyond anything that they can give any meaning

515
00:34:57.489 --> 00:35:01.129
to. I mean, because there's that risk you shouldn't

516
00:35:01.129 --> 00:35:03.689
reproduce, right? I mean, for me at least that's

517
00:35:03.689 --> 00:35:07.330
one of the strongest anti-Nalist arguments.

518
00:35:07.860 --> 00:35:11.610
Yeah, also for me it's one of the strongest

519
00:35:11.610 --> 00:35:14.580
arguments and uh I mean it's, I think that

520
00:35:14.580 --> 00:35:19.199
it's also uh one of the more um uh

521
00:35:19.290 --> 00:35:23.580
it's one of the arguments that uh um make

522
00:35:23.580 --> 00:35:27.270
all the people agree because uh for example other

523
00:35:27.270 --> 00:35:29.580
arguments uh I don't know, I'm thinking about the

524
00:35:29.580 --> 00:35:32.739
asymmetry argument is quite strong, but many people criticize

525
00:35:32.739 --> 00:35:36.060
it for many reasons and uh with the risk

526
00:35:36.060 --> 00:35:40.584
argument. I think that more and more people should

527
00:35:40.584 --> 00:35:42.945
be agreeing with this one because we are not

528
00:35:42.945 --> 00:35:45.995
speaking about we are not evaluating life saying it's

529
00:35:45.995 --> 00:35:48.475
bad, it's not bad, it's preferable not to be

530
00:35:48.475 --> 00:35:52.155
born. We are speaking about risks, so it's something

531
00:35:52.155 --> 00:35:55.854
that it's clear because also the life of the

532
00:35:56.635 --> 00:36:01.635
already living being, it's it's exposed to the risk

533
00:36:01.635 --> 00:36:05.439
and we must consider that. Uh, WE cannot prevent

534
00:36:05.439 --> 00:36:08.080
from the risk of life because we don't know

535
00:36:08.080 --> 00:36:10.000
which kind of risk we are going to be

536
00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:10.899
exposed.

537
00:36:11.639 --> 00:36:15.439
Yes, so let's talk a little bit about history

538
00:36:15.439 --> 00:36:17.919
here because you also talk about the history of

539
00:36:17.919 --> 00:36:22.040
antenatalism in your book slash monograph. So do we

540
00:36:22.040 --> 00:36:25.120
know how old antenatalism is?

541
00:36:26.699 --> 00:36:33.909
I think that 188 is quite old and I'm

542
00:36:33.909 --> 00:36:40.189
not able to find a starting point, but sometimes

543
00:36:40.189 --> 00:36:43.409
I usually reply to this question. Saying that maybe

544
00:36:43.409 --> 00:36:46.719
with the beginning of the life and of the

545
00:36:47.050 --> 00:36:52.489
aware life we start to have some some feeling

546
00:36:52.489 --> 00:36:58.120
about the arm of life itself because. There are

547
00:36:58.120 --> 00:37:02.179
many passages. One of that is Leopardi. The first

548
00:37:02.179 --> 00:37:05.729
of the moralists is the history of the human

549
00:37:05.729 --> 00:37:11.189
being, and he spoke about this population who celebrated

550
00:37:11.189 --> 00:37:15.909
the moment in which a person dies and the

551
00:37:15.909 --> 00:37:18.820
people. Cried when there was a new living being,

552
00:37:19.020 --> 00:37:22.969
a new living born being, and the same with

553
00:37:22.969 --> 00:37:26.060
Zap because Zafe, The Last Messiah, is a kind

554
00:37:26.060 --> 00:37:32.540
of Genesis tale but with a different with a

555
00:37:32.540 --> 00:37:35.939
different meaning. So I think that these are, these

556
00:37:35.939 --> 00:37:42.189
are different ways to say that. Maybe the the

557
00:37:42.189 --> 00:37:45.600
awareness, the knowledge of the life and of the

558
00:37:45.600 --> 00:37:49.879
suffering of life and of the truth that it

559
00:37:49.879 --> 00:37:52.959
would have been better not to be born, it

560
00:37:52.959 --> 00:37:56.479
starts with the. Yeah, with the presence of man,

561
00:37:56.600 --> 00:38:01.659
I also consider the the ileus reply to Midas,

562
00:38:01.800 --> 00:38:06.399
and this myth, it's a popular myth. I mean

563
00:38:06.399 --> 00:38:10.100
it's it's a kind of story which is not

564
00:38:10.760 --> 00:38:14.159
which is present in the population, in the first

565
00:38:14.159 --> 00:38:17.659
population, the first Greek population, so it means that

566
00:38:18.820 --> 00:38:22.879
the the fact of life was quite clear since

567
00:38:22.879 --> 00:38:23.699
the beginning.

568
00:38:24.560 --> 00:38:27.969
Mhm. Uh, HAVE there been, or would you say

569
00:38:27.969 --> 00:38:32.709
that there have been different forms of anti-atalism across

570
00:38:32.709 --> 00:38:32.969
history?

571
00:38:34.350 --> 00:38:38.110
Yes, of course, and yeah, of course, also because

572
00:38:38.110 --> 00:38:42.570
of the time and it depends on the distinction

573
00:38:42.570 --> 00:38:47.459
then because There are some distinctions between the so

574
00:38:47.459 --> 00:38:52.340
known pro-2naalism and the contemporary one which with which

575
00:38:52.340 --> 00:38:55.979
I disagree. For example, the Lachmanova distinction between the

576
00:38:55.979 --> 00:38:59.800
passive and the active way. It's something that I,

577
00:39:00.219 --> 00:39:02.580
I disagree because I think that it's a different

578
00:39:02.580 --> 00:39:06.459
paradigm. We cannot compare, and I think that the

579
00:39:06.459 --> 00:39:12.050
distinction of Morioca. It's quite it's quite good. I

580
00:39:12.050 --> 00:39:14.689
mean, I agree with this distinction because it's useful

581
00:39:14.689 --> 00:39:18.610
and it helps me to um he helped me

582
00:39:18.610 --> 00:39:23.649
to find the distinction between the metaphysical and the

583
00:39:23.649 --> 00:39:30.949
ethical perspective because Morioka distinguished between the so known

584
00:39:30.949 --> 00:39:36.209
birth negation and the procreation negation. And that is

585
00:39:36.209 --> 00:39:38.489
a way, in my opinion, to say that we

586
00:39:38.489 --> 00:39:42.169
have a kind of metaphysical perspective on antenatalism where

587
00:39:42.169 --> 00:39:46.250
we try to understand the meaning of birth, and

588
00:39:46.250 --> 00:39:50.129
this is the key concept of the Greek and

589
00:39:50.129 --> 00:39:54.290
all the first manifestation where we were, we were

590
00:39:54.290 --> 00:39:58.439
able to understand the difficulty of life, but we

591
00:39:58.439 --> 00:40:02.850
do we do nothing to solve it. And on

592
00:40:02.850 --> 00:40:06.719
the other side, this unknown procreation negation, which represents,

593
00:40:06.729 --> 00:40:10.649
in my opinion, a kind of normative way we

594
00:40:10.649 --> 00:40:17.649
should do something in order to stop the the

595
00:40:17.649 --> 00:40:19.030
birth of a new living being.

596
00:40:19.580 --> 00:40:22.939
Mhm. And what is it that in the book

597
00:40:22.939 --> 00:40:27.580
you call proto anti-atalism? I mean, what does that

598
00:40:27.580 --> 00:40:31.889
mean and what does it apply to in the

599
00:40:31.889 --> 00:40:33.340
history of anti-atalism?

600
00:40:34.610 --> 00:40:40.290
Yeah, I took this proto antina from the Lachmanova,

601
00:40:40.419 --> 00:40:45.300
so it's not my my words, but I like

602
00:40:45.300 --> 00:40:47.260
it also because I mean it's a way to

603
00:40:47.260 --> 00:40:53.500
distinguish from the contemporary one. And if I consider

604
00:40:53.500 --> 00:40:56.879
the Morioca distinction, and I will say that proto

605
00:40:56.879 --> 00:41:01.929
antiatism, so the proto form are all the. The

606
00:41:03.600 --> 00:41:10.399
proto the anti-natalist perspective that comes before Benatar, so

607
00:41:10.399 --> 00:41:15.790
before the contemporary debate on anti-natist. Where we, the

608
00:41:15.790 --> 00:41:18.830
discussion was but yeah, but the discussion was kind

609
00:41:18.830 --> 00:41:22.550
of uh uh in my opinion, er uh it's

610
00:41:22.550 --> 00:41:25.610
a kind of metaphysical discussion on the problem because

611
00:41:25.610 --> 00:41:28.870
we speak about only by about birth. We don't

612
00:41:28.870 --> 00:41:32.229
consider the procreation or the normative or what we

613
00:41:32.229 --> 00:41:35.570
have to do to stop procreation. We consider the

614
00:41:35.870 --> 00:41:36.770
what life is.

615
00:41:37.739 --> 00:41:41.830
Yeah, so, uh, uh, let's start by focusing here

616
00:41:41.830 --> 00:41:45.560
a little bit on the Western tradition and philosophy.

617
00:41:45.939 --> 00:41:50.739
Uh, LET'S talk about anti-atalism in ancient Greece. I

618
00:41:50.739 --> 00:41:52.979
mean, do you think that at least in the

619
00:41:52.979 --> 00:41:59.989
Western tradition it represents the oldest anti-Natalist manifestations and

620
00:42:00.409 --> 00:42:04.629
How did the Greeks back then approach matters of

621
00:42:04.969 --> 00:42:08.530
birth, life, death, and existence?

622
00:42:10.909 --> 00:42:15.729
First reply, yes, if we consider the Western tradition,

623
00:42:15.750 --> 00:42:18.989
and so I think that the Greeks' philosophy maybe

624
00:42:18.989 --> 00:42:21.830
is one of the most oldest, at least in

625
00:42:21.830 --> 00:42:27.314
Europe, and but because they were aware. Of the

626
00:42:27.314 --> 00:42:34.114
tragedy of life and I also asked for the

627
00:42:34.114 --> 00:42:37.155
question about life, meaning. I will say that in

628
00:42:37.155 --> 00:42:42.524
the Greek philosophy and there is a kind of

629
00:42:42.939 --> 00:42:46.060
A perception of what does it's life and what

630
00:42:46.060 --> 00:42:49.800
does it's death and but it was a perception

631
00:42:50.260 --> 00:42:54.459
far from the modern way to consider life. I

632
00:42:54.459 --> 00:42:57.899
mean it was a kind of ontocentric I would

633
00:42:57.899 --> 00:43:02.600
say position because they consider always life in relation

634
00:43:02.600 --> 00:43:05.419
to the general meaning of the word, the general.

635
00:43:05.620 --> 00:43:09.310
Meaning of the nature, so they consider life as

636
00:43:09.310 --> 00:43:12.790
well as the death natural way. I mean it's

637
00:43:12.790 --> 00:43:15.989
natural that we come into the world. It's natural

638
00:43:15.989 --> 00:43:20.949
that we passed away. We call this birth. We

639
00:43:20.949 --> 00:43:25.429
call this the end death, and I mean they

640
00:43:25.429 --> 00:43:30.949
were they were quite. Aware of the suffering, they

641
00:43:30.949 --> 00:43:33.870
were quite aware of the tragedy of sank into

642
00:43:33.870 --> 00:43:37.149
the world, but they accept it because it was

643
00:43:37.149 --> 00:43:40.709
in a general, um, from a user perspective, it

644
00:43:40.709 --> 00:43:44.250
was kind of um. I don't want to say

645
00:43:44.250 --> 00:43:47.850
normal, but yeah, they accept because they don't consider

646
00:43:47.850 --> 00:43:51.250
the life from their inner side perspective. Life is

647
00:43:51.250 --> 00:43:57.669
something that it's natural. It's the natural presence of

648
00:43:58.330 --> 00:44:03.489
something. And that has no real meaning. So and

649
00:44:03.489 --> 00:44:07.870
also what is interesting, as I said, Sino's reply

650
00:44:08.020 --> 00:44:12.889
was a kind of story which was common between

651
00:44:12.889 --> 00:44:17.000
the population. So does it mean that It was

652
00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:19.760
a kind of paradigm. The people, the people, as

653
00:44:19.760 --> 00:44:23.379
I said, to the cultural atmosphere was quite aware

654
00:44:23.379 --> 00:44:28.320
of the suffering and of the situation of human

655
00:44:28.320 --> 00:44:28.719
beings.

656
00:44:29.889 --> 00:44:32.610
I mean, we're focusing on philosophy, but I guess

657
00:44:32.610 --> 00:44:36.699
that this sort of uh topics, issues related to

658
00:44:36.699 --> 00:44:41.199
human existence, life, death, suffering, and so on also

659
00:44:41.199 --> 00:44:45.969
er manifested in their own uh fiction. I mean

660
00:44:45.969 --> 00:44:49.729
the, the Greek poets also wrote about this sort

661
00:44:49.729 --> 00:44:53.810
of topics even though perhaps some later philosophers like.

662
00:44:54.500 --> 00:44:57.989
Plato, I mean, he was not really fond of

663
00:44:57.989 --> 00:45:01.260
the poets. I mean, he preferred Socrates and the

664
00:45:01.260 --> 00:45:07.219
philosophers, but I mean it, the these are topics

665
00:45:07.219 --> 00:45:13.580
regarding human life that have manifested in Greece, not

666
00:45:13.580 --> 00:45:16.739
only in terms of its philosophy but also its

667
00:45:16.739 --> 00:45:17.979
fiction, right.

668
00:45:18.979 --> 00:45:21.629
Yeah, yeah, uh, if you're talking about the, uh,

669
00:45:22.590 --> 00:45:26.500
for example, the poets like the tragedy of Sophocles

670
00:45:26.500 --> 00:45:30.830
or, uh, yeah, of course, and I, I included

671
00:45:30.830 --> 00:45:36.149
them into the philosophical position because, um, yeah, in

672
00:45:36.149 --> 00:45:39.070
part because now I'm studying Nietzsche and Nietzsche considered

673
00:45:39.070 --> 00:45:43.429
the Greek and studies all these kind of um

674
00:45:43.429 --> 00:45:48.189
atmosphere, Greek atmosphere from this philosophical perspective. And uh

675
00:45:48.239 --> 00:45:53.419
also because the tragedy and er I mean they

676
00:45:53.439 --> 00:45:58.199
they were way to represent a piece of life.

677
00:45:58.270 --> 00:45:59.919
I mean so they are not, it's a kind

678
00:45:59.919 --> 00:46:02.239
of, I'm not sure it's a fiction. I think

679
00:46:02.239 --> 00:46:06.159
that it's a way to er to represent life,

680
00:46:06.239 --> 00:46:06.540
yeah.

681
00:46:07.149 --> 00:46:10.909
Mhm. Yeah, I mean definitely Nietzsche's The Birth of

682
00:46:10.909 --> 00:46:15.590
Tragedy is a very uh interesting book about that

683
00:46:15.590 --> 00:46:19.429
period of Greek history and the, the poets and

684
00:46:19.429 --> 00:46:21.989
so on and uh what he would call the

685
00:46:21.989 --> 00:46:26.469
Dionysians and and things like that. So, uh, do

686
00:46:26.469 --> 00:46:31.260
you think that there's any first anti-atalist philosopher that

687
00:46:31.260 --> 00:46:32.429
we can identify?

688
00:46:34.070 --> 00:46:39.919
Uh, NO, no, because of the reason I told

689
00:46:39.919 --> 00:46:42.000
you, I mean, uh, it was a kind of

690
00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:44.919
a different paradigm, so it was a kind of

691
00:46:44.919 --> 00:46:49.360
general awareness of the tragedy of life and of

692
00:46:49.360 --> 00:46:54.040
the. Yeah, all, all the implication of, uh, to

693
00:46:54.040 --> 00:46:57.679
be into the world, so, mm, no, I, I,

694
00:46:57.760 --> 00:47:00.560
I prefer speak about a kind of uh a

695
00:47:00.560 --> 00:47:05.290
different paradigm, a different uh perception which was general.

696
00:47:06.060 --> 00:47:11.320
Mhm. Uh, WITH Aristotle, of course, now we're going,

697
00:47:11.439 --> 00:47:15.040
uh, we're uh going forward a little bit, was

698
00:47:15.040 --> 00:47:17.600
Aristotle an antenatalist?

699
00:47:19.300 --> 00:47:23.469
Uh, NO, no, uh, because I was thinking that

700
00:47:23.469 --> 00:47:26.070
there was a passage where I spoke about Aristotle

701
00:47:26.070 --> 00:47:30.229
in the book, but no, uh, because the passage

702
00:47:30.229 --> 00:47:34.110
I was thinking it the same myth between Midas

703
00:47:34.110 --> 00:47:39.010
and Sius, but it was, it must be comprehended

704
00:47:39.010 --> 00:47:40.949
in the role of the soul. So it was

705
00:47:40.949 --> 00:47:45.030
the young Aristotle who was in the Plato Academia.

706
00:47:45.139 --> 00:47:46.629
So no, I think no.

707
00:47:47.929 --> 00:47:51.649
Uh, HOW about, uh, again in the Western tradition,

708
00:47:51.969 --> 00:47:57.409
how about Christianity? I mean, is a Christian antenatalism

709
00:47:57.409 --> 00:48:02.330
possible, keeping in mind that Christianity, I mean, at

710
00:48:02.330 --> 00:48:05.729
least as it is today and as it seems

711
00:48:05.729 --> 00:48:09.229
to me has been throughout most of its history,

712
00:48:09.570 --> 00:48:15.139
seems like a doctrine that supports pro-natalism par excellence.

713
00:48:17.600 --> 00:48:23.439
Yeah, your question gives me the possibility to clarify

714
00:48:23.439 --> 00:48:28.620
my position because I spoke about the Christian 188

715
00:48:28.620 --> 00:48:32.729
in my book. But I try to, uh, I

716
00:48:32.729 --> 00:48:36.129
mean, I discussed to feel the zero position on

717
00:48:36.129 --> 00:48:40.040
the Christian perception. I mean on the possibility to

718
00:48:40.040 --> 00:48:44.510
interpret some Christian, the Old and the New Testament

719
00:48:44.729 --> 00:48:49.409
in an anti atheistist way, but, and I find

720
00:48:49.409 --> 00:48:55.610
his interpretation quite interesting, but I think that we

721
00:48:55.610 --> 00:49:01.199
must. We must comprehend, we must understand the meaning

722
00:49:01.199 --> 00:49:05.040
of the Christian religion in its reality. I mean,

723
00:49:05.159 --> 00:49:08.159
and from this perspective, I would say that of

724
00:49:08.159 --> 00:49:11.600
course there is no any anti-natalism in the Christian

725
00:49:11.600 --> 00:49:15.600
religion, but because the meaning and of this religion,

726
00:49:16.040 --> 00:49:19.419
it's quite different from the anti-natalist position, of course.

727
00:49:19.600 --> 00:49:23.449
I think that. Uh, I think that the De

728
00:49:23.449 --> 00:49:27.800
Giro interpretation were quite, uh, some of that, um,

729
00:49:27.860 --> 00:49:31.310
uh, yeah, were quite, uh, uh, interesting, and they

730
00:49:31.310 --> 00:49:35.520
can open to new reflection, but in general I,

731
00:49:36.179 --> 00:49:39.020
I would prefer to say that it's only an

732
00:49:39.020 --> 00:49:42.919
interesting interpretation. I mean, I'm not sure to, um,

733
00:49:43.340 --> 00:49:45.300
to say that there is a, yeah, to say

734
00:49:45.300 --> 00:49:48.139
that there is a Christian 1880s, but because we

735
00:49:48.139 --> 00:49:50.919
have to distinguish. I mean, it's a. A kind

736
00:49:50.919 --> 00:49:55.199
of faith and he speaks it speaks about the

737
00:49:55.199 --> 00:50:00.840
afterlife and there are a kind of meaning about

738
00:50:00.840 --> 00:50:04.919
the quality of life that I mean I think

739
00:50:04.919 --> 00:50:09.060
that it's easier to say that Christian cannot be

740
00:50:09.060 --> 00:50:09.760
an at least.

741
00:50:11.300 --> 00:50:15.340
So you don't think then there's there that there's

742
00:50:15.340 --> 00:50:19.280
anything in the Bible that could be interpreted as

743
00:50:19.280 --> 00:50:21.979
explicitly antenatalist.

744
00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:30.689
Uh Maybe, maybe the coelle, uh, but maybe only

745
00:50:30.689 --> 00:50:33.669
yeah the coelle or some passage between the other.

746
00:50:33.939 --> 00:50:39.370
Book, but yeah, if I have to to consider

747
00:50:39.370 --> 00:50:43.000
the book of Coelle Ecclesiastes in Italian, it's Cole.

748
00:50:43.129 --> 00:50:45.860
I'm not sure it's the same in the international

749
00:50:45.860 --> 00:50:50.600
world and yeah maybe it can be considered an

750
00:50:50.610 --> 00:50:55.020
ancient at least because there are also some references

751
00:50:55.020 --> 00:51:00.790
on the. On the on the affirmation that it

752
00:51:00.790 --> 00:51:03.350
would have been better not to be born, but

753
00:51:03.350 --> 00:51:08.840
apart from that, and I'm I mean, we can,

754
00:51:09.060 --> 00:51:11.260
as I said, we can interpret some of this

755
00:51:11.260 --> 00:51:15.340
passage in an antiist way, but I'm not sure

756
00:51:15.340 --> 00:51:18.739
that it's our own interpretation. I mean,

757
00:51:19.580 --> 00:51:22.320
yeah, yeah, fair enough, and I mean, of course,

758
00:51:22.500 --> 00:51:24.570
for this kind of question. Uh, WE have to

759
00:51:24.570 --> 00:51:28.590
rely on the New Testament and the collection of,

760
00:51:28.649 --> 00:51:33.409
uh, books that they have there, but was Jesus

761
00:51:33.409 --> 00:51:36.610
in any way an anti-Natalist, or do you think

762
00:51:36.610 --> 00:51:39.209
he could have been an antenatalist?

763
00:51:40.040 --> 00:51:44.560
Uh, NO, I'll say no. I mean, yeah, I

764
00:51:44.560 --> 00:51:48.600
always have in mind all the interesting, uh, the

765
00:51:48.600 --> 00:51:51.360
book of the few de Giro, and I will

766
00:51:51.360 --> 00:51:54.070
say, oh yes, there are many pastors, but I

767
00:51:54.070 --> 00:51:56.840
have to consider my perception, and my perception is

768
00:51:56.840 --> 00:52:00.719
that, uh, no, because the meaning, the aim of

769
00:52:00.719 --> 00:52:03.629
the Bible and the new Old Testament is another

770
00:52:03.629 --> 00:52:05.620
one and it's not against life.

771
00:52:06.469 --> 00:52:11.669
Yeah, uh, what sort of manifestations of antenatalism can

772
00:52:11.669 --> 00:52:16.270
we find in eastern religion or philosophy?

773
00:52:17.159 --> 00:52:22.080
Well, I like that you speak about manifestation because

774
00:52:22.080 --> 00:52:26.260
I would say that we have many manifestations, but

775
00:52:26.610 --> 00:52:30.840
they are manifestations of antenatalism. So again, we can

776
00:52:30.840 --> 00:52:36.479
consider it quite similar to the anti-natalist perspective, but

777
00:52:38.120 --> 00:52:42.699
the meaning, the aim of this manifestation is quite

778
00:52:43.479 --> 00:52:48.524
quite different from. From our position because for example

779
00:52:48.524 --> 00:52:51.445
I don't know we can speak about the dukka

780
00:52:51.445 --> 00:52:54.334
which is the contents of the first through in

781
00:52:54.334 --> 00:52:57.604
the Buddhism and it's quite similar. We start from

782
00:52:57.604 --> 00:53:00.645
the reality of suffering, but then there is a

783
00:53:00.645 --> 00:53:04.965
way according to them to overcome this and we

784
00:53:04.965 --> 00:53:09.004
have the 8th path, but the aim is not

785
00:53:09.004 --> 00:53:14.659
to stop procreation but to stop the The cycle

786
00:53:14.659 --> 00:53:18.510
of rebirth, so we can, yeah, they negate birth,

787
00:53:18.520 --> 00:53:22.439
but is our coming into the world. I mean

788
00:53:22.439 --> 00:53:26.439
it's not against procreation, and there was also a

789
00:53:26.439 --> 00:53:29.620
kind of distinction in the level of the society

790
00:53:29.800 --> 00:53:34.399
and in the lower level there is they must

791
00:53:34.399 --> 00:53:37.945
procreate so. There is a kind of uh it's

792
00:53:37.945 --> 00:53:41.044
another kind of structure or if we consider that

793
00:53:41.044 --> 00:53:45.385
they they don't have the the kind of asceticism,

794
00:53:45.485 --> 00:53:48.364
I mean asceticism is not for not procreate, it's

795
00:53:48.364 --> 00:53:51.524
for to stop desire to join a kind of

796
00:53:51.524 --> 00:53:55.844
detachment from the reality. It's quite different from the

797
00:53:55.844 --> 00:54:00.419
ancient ageism. Position, but I think that we can

798
00:54:00.419 --> 00:54:04.100
find, we can, yeah, there are kind of similarity,

799
00:54:04.149 --> 00:54:08.179
of course it's quite meaningful that we have the

800
00:54:08.179 --> 00:54:13.050
same starting point because it means that. I mean

801
00:54:13.050 --> 00:54:17.850
there was a quiet awareness of the suffering of

802
00:54:17.850 --> 00:54:21.850
the world. Then we start from the same ground.

803
00:54:22.010 --> 00:54:24.649
Then they found another way to solve, to figure

804
00:54:24.649 --> 00:54:25.429
it out.

805
00:54:26.649 --> 00:54:29.010
I mean, uh this is just my opinion, but

806
00:54:29.010 --> 00:54:33.110
I guess that in at least an indirect way,

807
00:54:33.370 --> 00:54:37.969
er, if you fully commit to the Buddhist position

808
00:54:37.969 --> 00:54:40.830
of trying to overcome as much as you can

809
00:54:41.090 --> 00:54:45.909
your own desires, then at least indirectly it could

810
00:54:45.909 --> 00:54:49.330
lead you to anti-natalism because if you're trying to

811
00:54:49.330 --> 00:54:53.290
overcome your desires, one of them is to have

812
00:54:53.290 --> 00:54:56.419
sex, so. I mean, I, I don't know what

813
00:54:56.419 --> 00:54:57.540
you think about that, so.

814
00:54:59.439 --> 00:55:02.479
Yes, but I think that you stop to have

815
00:55:02.479 --> 00:55:06.810
sex and then you stop for physical reasons to

816
00:55:06.810 --> 00:55:09.840
have to have children. I mean, you not stop

817
00:55:09.840 --> 00:55:12.750
sex for not having children. You stop sex for

818
00:55:12.840 --> 00:55:17.040
for not feeling the desire. That means that create

819
00:55:17.040 --> 00:55:21.260
a kind of relation. So I'm not sure. It

820
00:55:21.260 --> 00:55:25.780
can be considered a kind of anti-natalism. I'm not

821
00:55:25.780 --> 00:55:27.560
sure to reply to your question in the right

822
00:55:27.560 --> 00:55:27.570
way.

823
00:55:27.870 --> 00:55:29.649
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, yes, so

824
00:55:29.649 --> 00:55:32.820
I agree with you. It's probably not an anti-natalist

825
00:55:32.820 --> 00:55:36.659
position because it doesn't come from the argument or

826
00:55:36.659 --> 00:55:41.225
the premise. Is that you shouldn't reproduce because it's

827
00:55:41.225 --> 00:55:44.235
bad to reproduce. It's just that you end up

828
00:55:44.235 --> 00:55:48.905
not reproducing because as a consequence of overcoming your

829
00:55:48.905 --> 00:55:52.915
desire, so it's not the same thing, right? Yeah,

830
00:55:52.925 --> 00:55:53.104
and also because

831
00:55:53.104 --> 00:55:56.885
I think uh if I cannot, I also think

832
00:55:56.885 --> 00:56:00.540
that uh um. I mean, as I said, we

833
00:56:00.540 --> 00:56:03.580
start from the same position of the suffering of

834
00:56:03.580 --> 00:56:07.379
the world, but for the ancientists we can stop

835
00:56:07.379 --> 00:56:12.379
only by not reproducing. For them, the solution is

836
00:56:12.379 --> 00:56:16.659
a detachment from the reality. It's different. There is

837
00:56:16.659 --> 00:56:19.179
a is a way, is a different way to

838
00:56:19.179 --> 00:56:20.919
stay into the world, I would say.

839
00:56:21.580 --> 00:56:24.780
No, yeah, I, I agree with you. So, uh,

840
00:56:24.899 --> 00:56:30.330
in the more modern, uh, period, what manifestations of

841
00:56:30.330 --> 00:56:34.179
antenatalism can we find and perhaps let's start by

842
00:56:34.179 --> 00:56:38.739
comparing, uh, ancient forms of antenatalism with the ones

843
00:56:38.739 --> 00:56:42.919
that we saw in the 19th and the 20th

844
00:56:42.919 --> 00:56:43.870
centuries.

845
00:56:44.780 --> 00:56:49.570
Mm I would say that in the modern age

846
00:56:49.570 --> 00:56:55.689
we don't have the antenatist some antenatalist manifestations. I

847
00:56:55.689 --> 00:57:00.090
mean we can find in Leibniz Pascal some argument

848
00:57:00.090 --> 00:57:04.659
that can be a kind of Premise for the

849
00:57:04.909 --> 00:57:08.840
anti-natalism. I was thinking about the divertissement, that is

850
00:57:08.840 --> 00:57:13.820
kind of the mechanism of the funds, but I

851
00:57:13.820 --> 00:57:18.629
think that what happened in the modern age was

852
00:57:19.179 --> 00:57:24.300
The affirmation of the anthropocentric paradigm because there was

853
00:57:24.820 --> 00:57:28.580
the trust that man can can know the nature,

854
00:57:28.739 --> 00:57:31.540
can control it, and by controlling it, it can

855
00:57:31.540 --> 00:57:36.010
be he can be able to join the happiness

856
00:57:36.010 --> 00:57:43.629
and the idealism was the The top of this

857
00:57:44.929 --> 00:57:48.810
anthropocentric perception and distrust on men and on the

858
00:57:48.810 --> 00:57:52.209
possibility of man to to say to the world,

859
00:57:52.290 --> 00:57:57.080
to control the world, and in fact, after the

860
00:57:57.080 --> 00:58:00.080
I mean in the same time of the idealism

861
00:58:00.080 --> 00:58:05.469
we have the pessimistic perspective in Germany. And I

862
00:58:05.469 --> 00:58:09.070
don't like to, I don't like pessimistic, but this

863
00:58:09.070 --> 00:58:12.350
is the way in which the group of philosopher

864
00:58:12.350 --> 00:58:15.110
of the second half of the 19th century were

865
00:58:15.110 --> 00:58:19.320
considered. So just to be clear. And that represents

866
00:58:19.320 --> 00:58:22.100
a kind of coming back to the first position,

867
00:58:22.199 --> 00:58:25.979
the coming back to the suffer for the world,

868
00:58:26.239 --> 00:58:31.399
the way the world it is, and so I

869
00:58:31.399 --> 00:58:34.899
don't speak about the teenageism in the modern age.

870
00:58:36.034 --> 00:58:39.445
In the second half of the 19th century, but

871
00:58:39.445 --> 00:58:43.084
because we come back to some perception of the

872
00:58:43.094 --> 00:58:47.995
Greek philosophy of the past philosophy, and I think

873
00:58:47.995 --> 00:58:52.564
that if we have to speak about modern anti-naism,

874
00:58:52.675 --> 00:58:56.530
maybe it starts with Yeah, it starts at the

875
00:58:56.530 --> 00:58:59.399
end of the 19th century, so it's uh Kurning

876
00:58:59.399 --> 00:59:05.570
and za, uh, but, yeah, and then it's a

877
00:59:05.570 --> 00:59:12.250
kind of proto-1atalism also because the, uh, it remains

878
00:59:12.250 --> 00:59:18.330
a kind of metaphysical frame for the argument of

879
00:59:18.330 --> 00:59:21.250
being born. I mean it's not the, it's still

880
00:59:21.250 --> 00:59:24.810
not the argument in the Benatarian way I would

881
00:59:24.810 --> 00:59:25.209
say.

882
00:59:26.310 --> 00:59:30.149
Do you think that there's anything in the philosophy

883
00:59:30.149 --> 00:59:34.590
of someone like Schopenhauer that we could link to

884
00:59:34.590 --> 00:59:35.669
anti-natalism?

885
00:59:36.530 --> 00:59:42.209
Yes and no, because I think that there are

886
00:59:42.209 --> 00:59:46.959
many features that can be considered like anti at

887
00:59:46.959 --> 00:59:50.350
list, some quotations that can be interpreted in an

888
00:59:50.360 --> 00:59:53.449
anti at list, and first of all, I mean

889
00:59:53.449 --> 00:59:58.810
Schopenhauer speaks about the will to live and the

890
00:59:58.810 --> 01:00:04.399
suffer that the will is for men, OK, but

891
01:00:04.929 --> 01:00:08.889
In the first page of the word as Will

892
01:00:08.889 --> 01:00:14.209
and representation, um he uh he gives us, he

893
01:00:14.209 --> 01:00:18.209
gave us a kind of uh advice when we

894
01:00:18.209 --> 01:00:21.169
have to read his book, we have to consider

895
01:00:21.169 --> 01:00:25.070
his book as um as a system, as a

896
01:00:25.070 --> 01:00:28.850
unique book, and if we have to follow this

897
01:00:29.729 --> 01:00:33.975
method, I would say that uh. Not an anti-theism

898
01:00:33.975 --> 01:00:40.254
because we can only try to follow the will

899
01:00:40.254 --> 01:00:43.334
to live and in my opinion, the way in

900
01:00:43.334 --> 01:00:47.135
which we can stop the abolition of the power

901
01:00:47.135 --> 01:00:51.399
of the will, it's a way. That is different

902
01:00:51.399 --> 01:00:56.280
from the anti-natalist behavior. It's a kind of the

903
01:00:56.280 --> 01:00:59.159
ascetic position, the role of the art, the role

904
01:00:59.159 --> 01:01:04.120
of the compassion, but there are some passages in

905
01:01:04.120 --> 01:01:13.399
which Schopenhauer himself assessed that. It's we cannot murder

906
01:01:13.399 --> 01:01:18.189
the child, and we can only follow the nature.

907
01:01:18.439 --> 01:01:20.860
I mean, we cannot stop recreation in this sense.

908
01:01:21.719 --> 01:01:25.159
Uh, HOW about Hartmann? You also mentioned in your,

909
01:01:25.280 --> 01:01:28.699
in your book, I mean, uh, is there anything

910
01:01:28.699 --> 01:01:33.149
in his philosophy that you would consider antenatalist?

911
01:01:33.689 --> 01:01:37.570
Uh. Yes, if we consider the results, because we

912
01:01:37.570 --> 01:01:41.209
have this evolution from the unconscious to the conscious

913
01:01:41.209 --> 01:01:45.370
reality and this movement brings to the end, which

914
01:01:45.370 --> 01:01:47.090
is the end of the world and the end

915
01:01:47.090 --> 01:01:50.129
of the human being, and so we can maybe

916
01:01:50.129 --> 01:01:53.889
consider that there is this kind of movement which

917
01:01:53.889 --> 01:01:57.129
is divided in different ways and at the end

918
01:01:57.129 --> 01:02:02.570
we join these results. But I'm not so, I

919
01:02:02.570 --> 01:02:04.530
mean, yeah, maybe we can consider a kind of

920
01:02:04.530 --> 01:02:07.929
anti-natalist because the result is that we stop with

921
01:02:07.929 --> 01:02:11.850
human beings, but I think that it's a kind

922
01:02:11.850 --> 01:02:19.050
of anti-natalism that we should comprehend in the idealistic

923
01:02:19.050 --> 01:02:22.169
position of of Arman. I mean it's a kind

924
01:02:22.169 --> 01:02:26.229
of the movement that the words. That the world

925
01:02:26.229 --> 01:02:29.429
goes to do apart from the human being. The

926
01:02:29.429 --> 01:02:32.429
unconscious or the conscious is not the conscious or

927
01:02:32.429 --> 01:02:35.070
unconscious of the human being. It's a general movement

928
01:02:35.070 --> 01:02:37.550
of the world. So I'm not sure it's an

929
01:02:37.560 --> 01:02:41.189
antenatalism in the way that we decide to not

930
01:02:41.189 --> 01:02:43.370
have children because we understand and.

931
01:02:44.989 --> 01:02:49.629
So in modernity, in modern times, who would you

932
01:02:49.629 --> 01:02:56.310
say is the first full-fledged anti-atalist? I mean, who

933
01:02:56.310 --> 01:03:01.229
was the first philosopher that in his or her

934
01:03:01.229 --> 01:03:07.310
philosophy was explicitly making anti-atalist arguments?

935
01:03:07.790 --> 01:03:16.389
Uh, I would say maybe the Pseudonym Koning, but

936
01:03:16.389 --> 01:03:20.070
I, I only, um, I mean, I don't want

937
01:03:20.070 --> 01:03:24.429
to tell more about him because I studied only

938
01:03:24.429 --> 01:03:29.510
the beautiful works of Karima Karma and so for

939
01:03:29.510 --> 01:03:34.320
the philosopher that I I know better. I would

940
01:03:34.320 --> 01:03:36.919
say better vessels up for me. It's a kind

941
01:03:36.919 --> 01:03:44.479
of turning point and between the previous previous form

942
01:03:44.479 --> 01:03:50.120
of anti-natalism and the contemporary way because the passage

943
01:03:50.120 --> 01:03:53.370
of the last. It's quite interesting. We have the

944
01:03:55.340 --> 01:03:59.020
the assessment that you must, you don't stop, you

945
01:03:59.020 --> 01:04:04.659
have to stop procreate and leave the earth free

946
01:04:04.659 --> 01:04:06.780
from the presence of man. So I would say

947
01:04:06.780 --> 01:04:08.419
maybe better vessels up.

948
01:04:09.370 --> 01:04:11.530
OK, so, uh, tell us more about him, about,

949
01:04:11.540 --> 01:04:15.669
uh, Peter Wessels Za. I mean, how important is

950
01:04:15.669 --> 01:04:19.939
he in the history of anti-Nalism and, uh, what

951
01:04:19.939 --> 01:04:23.659
were his main ideas and contributions to the topic?

952
01:04:25.159 --> 01:04:30.010
It's a philosopher that I appreciate in a particular

953
01:04:30.010 --> 01:04:33.969
way. I like the, I like his philosophy and

954
01:04:33.969 --> 01:04:37.979
the way he he discusses and he studies man

955
01:04:37.979 --> 01:04:41.129
because it's a kind of biological perspective, so it's

956
01:04:41.129 --> 01:04:45.000
something where we, uh, we, he, I mean, in

957
01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:47.050
my opinion, he has not a kind of inner

958
01:04:47.050 --> 01:04:50.169
side of the. He studies human beings as all

959
01:04:50.169 --> 01:04:54.050
the other animals, and we discovered that life is

960
01:04:54.050 --> 01:04:57.530
not so beautiful as we believed, and I think

961
01:04:57.530 --> 01:04:59.489
that one of the main roles is the role

962
01:04:59.489 --> 01:05:04.370
of the consciousness and the identity between consciousness and

963
01:05:04.370 --> 01:05:07.449
harm, which is something I mean it's not new,

964
01:05:07.530 --> 01:05:10.689
but in the last Messiah it's quite clear that

965
01:05:10.689 --> 01:05:14.080
the Consciousness, it's one of the main reasons of

966
01:05:14.080 --> 01:05:17.840
suffering for human beings and it's also a kind

967
01:05:17.840 --> 01:05:23.000
of metaphysical position in which man is considered as

968
01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:25.159
part of the nature, but it's a nature that

969
01:05:25.159 --> 01:05:29.909
refuses presence and all the story. In my perspective,

970
01:05:29.959 --> 01:05:33.360
it represents, um, I spoke before as a kind

971
01:05:33.360 --> 01:05:41.760
of starting point, as a turning point because. In

972
01:05:41.760 --> 01:05:45.360
my opinion, it represents the moment in which we

973
01:05:45.360 --> 01:05:50.239
can find both the previous form of anti-natalism and

974
01:05:50.239 --> 01:05:54.000
the contemporary form of antenatalism because we have on

975
01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:58.560
the one hand the metaphysical perspective, so the description

976
01:05:58.560 --> 01:06:04.250
of the human being, this descriptive descriptive. Awareness of

977
01:06:04.250 --> 01:06:07.770
the words and on the other hand we have

978
01:06:07.770 --> 01:06:12.750
the ethical reply stop, don't reproduce, don't be fruitful

979
01:06:12.750 --> 01:06:18.399
and so in this way I think that he

980
01:06:18.399 --> 01:06:22.530
can be considered a kind of key moment in

981
01:06:22.530 --> 01:06:26.030
the past between the old and the contemporary anti-ism.

982
01:06:27.639 --> 01:06:29.969
Uh, I mean this is just, uh, an aside,

983
01:06:30.050 --> 01:06:32.649
this is just a joke, but since you're Italian

984
01:06:32.649 --> 01:06:35.199
and at a certain point you said there that,

985
01:06:35.250 --> 01:06:38.340
uh, I mean in Zapfas, I mean he sort

986
01:06:38.340 --> 01:06:41.489
of got into how life is not beautiful, I

987
01:06:41.489 --> 01:06:45.250
guess that probably you're not very fond of Roberto

988
01:06:45.250 --> 01:06:46.649
Benini's Lavitabella.

989
01:06:49.750 --> 01:06:51.750
And it's a movie that I don't like, but

990
01:06:51.750 --> 01:06:54.350
I suppose that I'm one of the few people

991
01:06:54.350 --> 01:06:57.830
in Italy who doesn't, don't appreciate this, uh, this

992
01:06:57.830 --> 01:06:58.810
movie, so, uh,

993
01:06:59.850 --> 01:07:01.679
I, I mean, he won an Oscar with it,

994
01:07:01.830 --> 01:07:04.830
so I guess that's why Italian people also love

995
01:07:04.830 --> 01:07:06.000
him, so, right.

996
01:07:06.189 --> 01:07:09.669
Yeah, and also for, yeah, I mean for many,

997
01:07:09.750 --> 01:07:12.610
many reasons, but uh I don't like.

998
01:07:14.620 --> 01:07:18.580
OK, so, uh, let's get into the theoretical aspects

999
01:07:18.580 --> 01:07:21.739
of anti-atalism. We already talked a little bit about

1000
01:07:21.739 --> 01:07:25.179
them, uh, but, oh, OK, so earlier we talked

1001
01:07:25.179 --> 01:07:28.780
about, you mentioned the asymmetry argument, we talked about

1002
01:07:28.780 --> 01:07:32.699
the risk argument. What do you think are the

1003
01:07:32.699 --> 01:07:36.459
strongest arguments in favor of anti-natalism?

1004
01:07:38.469 --> 01:07:40.489
As we said before, I think that the risk

1005
01:07:40.489 --> 01:07:44.449
argument is one of the strongest arguments. We are

1006
01:07:44.449 --> 01:07:46.949
speaking against anti-natalism

1007
01:07:48.090 --> 01:07:49.729
in favor, in favor of in

1008
01:07:49.729 --> 01:07:53.530
favor the risk argument, in my opinion, is one

1009
01:07:53.530 --> 01:08:00.030
of the strongest arguments. To deal with an innateism

1010
01:08:00.030 --> 01:08:03.840
because we are not, I mean I think that

1011
01:08:03.840 --> 01:08:08.120
it's the the more formal. We don't speak about

1012
01:08:08.120 --> 01:08:11.199
suffering, we don't judge, we don't make evaluation, but

1013
01:08:11.199 --> 01:08:14.560
we only say that we expose someone else to

1014
01:08:14.560 --> 01:08:17.709
the risk of coming into the world and all

1015
01:08:17.709 --> 01:08:21.819
the all the things that we have discussed before

1016
01:08:22.049 --> 01:08:26.749
and also the The quality of life argument, it's

1017
01:08:26.749 --> 01:08:29.508
a kind of argument that I appreciate. It's maybe

1018
01:08:29.508 --> 01:08:33.988
the most simple and because uh I mean we

1019
01:08:33.988 --> 01:08:39.087
have only see the life and see all the

1020
01:08:39.349 --> 01:08:44.068
uh the difficulty that we have in our life

1021
01:08:44.068 --> 01:08:46.548
every day, but I think that it's quite strong

1022
01:08:46.548 --> 01:08:50.249
maybe for this reason and uh yeah, the other.

1023
01:08:50.890 --> 01:08:53.779
Uh, uh, I mean, uh, they are interesting, but

1024
01:08:53.779 --> 01:08:56.700
I'm not sure that they are really, really strong.

1025
01:08:56.910 --> 01:09:00.859
For example, the asymmetry argument or the constant arguments,

1026
01:09:01.370 --> 01:09:04.339
they are quite interesting, but I'm not sure they

1027
01:09:04.339 --> 01:09:05.680
are so strong.

1028
01:09:06.330 --> 01:09:09.979
Oh, OK, so let's tackle those two arguments in

1029
01:09:09.979 --> 01:09:13.779
turn. So what do you make of David Bennettar's

1030
01:09:13.779 --> 01:09:15.540
symmetry argument?

1031
01:09:16.640 --> 01:09:21.609
Uh, WELL, I like this argument and also I

1032
01:09:21.609 --> 01:09:24.169
like the, uh, I mean I find it interesting

1033
01:09:24.169 --> 01:09:29.250
because um uh Benatar was able to, um, to

1034
01:09:29.250 --> 01:09:34.770
put together two different um hypotheses, uh, hypothesis maybe

1035
01:09:34.770 --> 01:09:37.930
in English, uh, one in which X exists and

1036
01:09:37.930 --> 01:09:41.649
the other in which this Xs does not exist

1037
01:09:41.649 --> 01:09:47.549
and uh from this. To compare this to possible

1038
01:09:47.549 --> 01:09:51.430
reality, we can say that existence is not better

1039
01:09:51.430 --> 01:09:54.089
than non-existence and at the same time that maybe

1040
01:09:54.669 --> 01:10:00.029
non-existence, it will be preferable. So I I appreciate

1041
01:10:00.029 --> 01:10:03.890
the main idea, but I think that. In the

1042
01:10:03.890 --> 01:10:08.490
asymmetry argument, there is something, I mean, I'm not

1043
01:10:08.490 --> 01:10:15.089
sure about the premise 3 and 4, and which

1044
01:10:15.089 --> 01:10:17.689
are the premise where we discuss about the non-existent

1045
01:10:17.689 --> 01:10:21.089
being because in my opinion we are discussing this

1046
01:10:21.089 --> 01:10:26.689
premise regards always the living being. So maybe yeah,

1047
01:10:26.770 --> 01:10:30.750
maybe it's only an argument that it's quite interesting,

1048
01:10:30.759 --> 01:10:34.910
but. I'm not sure that we are comparing these

1049
01:10:34.910 --> 01:10:38.470
two situations. We are comparing all the life which

1050
01:10:38.470 --> 01:10:40.899
already exists, so maybe the quality of life argument

1051
01:10:40.899 --> 01:10:45.430
is stronger and more useful and Less subject to

1052
01:10:45.430 --> 01:10:49.729
all the criticism that the asymmetry argument uh uh

1053
01:10:50.290 --> 01:10:54.149
uh yeah, there were many different, many, many people

1054
01:10:54.149 --> 01:10:57.430
who criticize this argument for the role of the

1055
01:10:57.430 --> 01:11:01.009
premise, so maybe other arguments are better.

1056
01:11:01.850 --> 01:11:04.129
Yeah, before you tell us a little bit more

1057
01:11:04.129 --> 01:11:06.729
about the quality of life argument, let me just

1058
01:11:06.729 --> 01:11:10.250
say that I, I'm quite fond of David Benatar's

1059
01:11:10.250 --> 01:11:14.330
philosophy, but when it comes to anti-natalism specifically, I

1060
01:11:14.330 --> 01:11:17.290
think I said this in my interview with Amanda

1061
01:11:17.290 --> 01:11:21.629
Sukernik for her podcast, uh, the Exploring Anti-atalism podcast.

1062
01:11:22.060 --> 01:11:25.346
I mean, I said that. Over time I moved,

1063
01:11:25.525 --> 01:11:29.645
I've been moving away from some of his anti-atalist

1064
01:11:29.645 --> 01:11:35.195
arguments, specifically the asymmetry argument, because the, the bit

1065
01:11:35.206 --> 01:11:40.726
about the non-existent being, I mean for me is

1066
01:11:40.726 --> 01:11:44.445
not really quite convincing, and I think that particular.

1067
01:11:44.961 --> 01:11:49.021
FOR people who are not anti-natalists and you're trying

1068
01:11:49.021 --> 01:11:52.872
to uh argue in favor of anti-natalism, I mean,

1069
01:11:52.912 --> 01:11:56.921
it's a very weird argument for most people because

1070
01:11:56.921 --> 01:12:00.521
they, it's very hard for them to understand why

1071
01:12:00.521 --> 01:12:04.722
you would be talking about someone who would never

1072
01:12:04.722 --> 01:12:05.262
exist,

1073
01:12:05.642 --> 01:12:10.209
right? Yeah, and also if we, but I come

1074
01:12:10.209 --> 01:12:14.189
back to Plato, I mean maybe also not Plato,

1075
01:12:14.250 --> 01:12:17.930
but if we consider the non-existent and I mean

1076
01:12:17.930 --> 01:12:21.330
the judgment we do are, as I said, in

1077
01:12:21.330 --> 01:12:26.410
my opinion, are judgment that regards the existent being

1078
01:12:26.410 --> 01:12:30.339
because if we speak with non-existent. It's like we

1079
01:12:30.339 --> 01:12:33.700
cannot, we can say anything about them. We can

1080
01:12:33.700 --> 01:12:37.899
only evaluate life as it is and to establish

1081
01:12:37.899 --> 01:12:41.720
from the our position of living me that maybe

1082
01:12:41.899 --> 01:12:44.759
not being born, it will be better, but because

1083
01:12:45.020 --> 01:12:48.839
something already exists, I mean. Uh, YEAH, it's something,

1084
01:12:48.919 --> 01:12:51.600
uh, it's an argument that I find quite strong

1085
01:12:51.600 --> 01:12:54.959
if we want to compare because it's clear, but

1086
01:12:54.959 --> 01:12:57.459
there are also for me, uh, there are many,

1087
01:12:57.640 --> 01:13:00.500
um, there is something that must be clarified.

1088
01:13:01.299 --> 01:13:04.640
Mhm. And what is then the quality of life

1089
01:13:04.640 --> 01:13:06.790
argument and what do you think about it?

1090
01:13:08.149 --> 01:13:10.439
I think that it's, as I said, it's one

1091
01:13:10.439 --> 01:13:16.020
of the strongest arguments and also one of the

1092
01:13:16.240 --> 01:13:21.680
maybe the easiest arguments, but because I mean we

1093
01:13:21.680 --> 01:13:25.120
can create a list of all possible reasons of

1094
01:13:25.120 --> 01:13:30.120
suffering and we can consider the suffering that we

1095
01:13:30.120 --> 01:13:33.160
received, the suffering that we create for other human

1096
01:13:33.160 --> 01:13:39.080
beings. I mean it's maybe one of the Argument

1097
01:13:39.080 --> 01:13:45.879
that requires less less um you know, less dialectic,

1098
01:13:45.959 --> 01:13:48.439
so we don't have to speak enough about it

1099
01:13:48.439 --> 01:13:52.279
because it's clear and it's interesting that to come

1100
01:13:52.279 --> 01:13:55.194
back to Bernaar, the asymmetry. Argument is one of

1101
01:13:55.194 --> 01:13:59.345
the most argued, criticized. The quality of life is

1102
01:13:59.345 --> 01:14:02.785
not so criticized, so maybe it's quite clear from

1103
01:14:02.785 --> 01:14:09.725
itself that life is contents, all this bad stuff

1104
01:14:09.725 --> 01:14:10.285
maybe.

1105
01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:13.910
Mhm. And what do you make of the argument

1106
01:14:14.450 --> 01:14:17.209
from consent? I mean, do you think that there

1107
01:14:17.209 --> 01:14:21.439
is a convincing argument and as a philosopher, what

1108
01:14:21.439 --> 01:14:22.529
do you think about it?

1109
01:14:23.649 --> 01:14:27.810
Uh, I think that I understand the argument and

1110
01:14:27.810 --> 01:14:30.490
the reason of the argument, but I disagree with

1111
01:14:30.490 --> 01:14:33.509
it. It's one of the positions that I found,

1112
01:14:33.709 --> 01:14:36.609
uh, uh, I mean for me there is no

1113
01:14:36.609 --> 01:14:40.970
sense in this argument because, uh, I understand that

1114
01:14:40.970 --> 01:14:43.939
the role of the consent, anyone can decide from

1115
01:14:43.939 --> 01:14:47.729
uh for him, for his or her coming into

1116
01:14:47.729 --> 01:14:50.870
the world, but I mean it's impossible to ask

1117
01:14:50.870 --> 01:14:54.129
to other people the consent also in the. If

1118
01:14:54.129 --> 01:14:57.620
we, if we read in the encyclopedia the voice

1119
01:14:57.620 --> 01:15:00.750
for consent, we have the A actor and a

1120
01:15:00.750 --> 01:15:03.669
B actor, and I mean there is a living

1121
01:15:03.669 --> 01:15:08.169
being and also we have all the other possible

1122
01:15:08.169 --> 01:15:10.569
situations he must be aware and he must be.

1123
01:15:10.725 --> 01:15:14.435
In healthy to take decisions, so I think that

1124
01:15:14.435 --> 01:15:17.214
with the unborn it's impossible to have this kind

1125
01:15:17.214 --> 01:15:20.634
of people who are able to give you a

1126
01:15:20.634 --> 01:15:24.785
consent to is coming. I think that in the

1127
01:15:24.785 --> 01:15:29.470
book I spoke about a kind of. Gap between

1128
01:15:29.470 --> 01:15:31.790
the first and the third person. I mean, as

1129
01:15:31.790 --> 01:15:35.830
I said, we cannot decide for someone else because

1130
01:15:35.830 --> 01:15:39.770
even if our decision seems quite good and we,

1131
01:15:39.910 --> 01:15:45.890
we have the best. You know, the best we

1132
01:15:45.890 --> 01:15:49.129
can do the best for our kids, we cannot

1133
01:15:49.129 --> 01:15:52.290
know the life he's going to to to live,

1134
01:15:52.370 --> 01:15:55.209
and we cannot decide for him because maybe for

1135
01:15:55.209 --> 01:15:58.089
us it's easy to solve some problem, but for

1136
01:15:58.089 --> 01:16:01.810
him it's a reason of suffer and so I

1137
01:16:01.810 --> 01:16:04.129
mean we cannot decide for others. There is a

1138
01:16:04.129 --> 01:16:07.810
huge gap between our life and that of the

1139
01:16:07.810 --> 01:16:09.890
others. We can try to do our our best,

1140
01:16:09.970 --> 01:16:13.069
but it remains his or her own life.

1141
01:16:14.279 --> 01:16:17.229
Yes, uh, I also think that I, I mean,

1142
01:16:17.240 --> 01:16:20.859
because I also bring to the table how people

1143
01:16:20.859 --> 01:16:24.680
commonly react to these kinds of arguments, not just

1144
01:16:24.680 --> 01:16:27.919
about how philosophers think about them, because I mean

1145
01:16:27.919 --> 01:16:30.600
in terms of philosophy, yes, we can understand those

1146
01:16:30.600 --> 01:16:33.279
arguments, but we also have to admit that some

1147
01:16:33.279 --> 01:16:37.160
of them are very abstract arguments like the argument

1148
01:16:37.160 --> 01:16:40.734
of consent. I mean because. For most people, if

1149
01:16:40.734 --> 01:16:43.484
you expose them to that argument, they might say

1150
01:16:44.535 --> 01:16:49.075
yeah right I mean you people don't consent to

1151
01:16:49.294 --> 01:16:53.415
becoming uh to uh coming into existence, but why

1152
01:16:53.415 --> 01:16:55.415
does that matter? I mean what can we do

1153
01:16:55.415 --> 01:16:59.654
with that? There's no one there yet to consent,

1154
01:16:59.694 --> 01:17:03.734
so for most people that argument doesn't really make

1155
01:17:03.734 --> 01:17:04.995
sense, you know,

1156
01:17:05.334 --> 01:17:08.020
yeah, and. I mean, I have to confess they

1157
01:17:08.020 --> 01:17:12.950
agree with this perception because there is anyone and

1158
01:17:13.450 --> 01:17:16.100
of course it's a decision. I mean, maybe it's

1159
01:17:16.100 --> 01:17:19.419
better to say, OK, it's a decision that we

1160
01:17:19.419 --> 01:17:23.740
take for someone who still does not. Exist and

1161
01:17:23.740 --> 01:17:27.470
we decide considering our life it's preferable in because

1162
01:17:27.890 --> 01:17:30.009
of course there is anyone and also in the

1163
01:17:30.009 --> 01:17:35.129
first year a kid, a young a child is

1164
01:17:35.129 --> 01:17:39.479
not able to give consent is not aware of

1165
01:17:39.479 --> 01:17:43.509
the life and all the implication of life.

1166
01:17:44.200 --> 01:17:46.919
Yeah, so I was going to ask you how

1167
01:17:46.919 --> 01:17:50.040
much objective suffering do you think there is in

1168
01:17:50.040 --> 01:17:52.680
human life? I mean, earlier, we've already talked a

1169
01:17:52.680 --> 01:17:58.220
little bit about uh objectivity and subjectivity when evaluating

1170
01:17:58.600 --> 01:18:01.939
uh the good and bad aspects of life. So

1171
01:18:02.200 --> 01:18:05.600
do you think that it is possible to approach

1172
01:18:05.600 --> 01:18:12.180
this question objectively in some way or only subjectively?

1173
01:18:12.569 --> 01:18:18.560
Uh. I would say maybe that we can we

1174
01:18:18.560 --> 01:18:22.649
can speak about objectivity if we consider some intrinsic

1175
01:18:22.649 --> 01:18:27.100
aspect of suffering of life. So for example, I

1176
01:18:27.100 --> 01:18:30.299
mean, as I said, we cannot establish the same,

1177
01:18:30.379 --> 01:18:32.899
we don't suffer for the same reason, but we

1178
01:18:32.899 --> 01:18:36.319
can say that maybe there are some intrinsic. Um,

1179
01:18:37.549 --> 01:18:41.229
REASON of suffering, the hunger, for example, is one

1180
01:18:41.229 --> 01:18:45.819
of them. The, uh, I don't know, the, the

1181
01:18:45.819 --> 01:18:48.990
war maybe, but I, I, no, the war, I

1182
01:18:48.990 --> 01:18:53.600
would prefer to speak about some. Biological aspect, something

1183
01:18:53.600 --> 01:18:57.240
that is related to the way we are in

1184
01:18:57.240 --> 01:18:59.720
the world, so maybe the consciousness for a human

1185
01:18:59.720 --> 01:19:04.209
being or Maybe also the awareness of this, why

1186
01:19:04.209 --> 01:19:06.569
not, even if we, as I said, we should

1187
01:19:06.569 --> 01:19:10.399
distinguish between the process of dying and the act,

1188
01:19:10.649 --> 01:19:13.589
but that of course it's something that makes people

1189
01:19:14.939 --> 01:19:19.410
feel uh troubled with the idea and that they

1190
01:19:19.410 --> 01:19:22.129
are going to die and they are going to

1191
01:19:22.129 --> 01:19:26.209
not stay into the world uh I mean they

1192
01:19:26.209 --> 01:19:27.970
stay into the world for a short time and

1193
01:19:27.970 --> 01:19:29.009
a limited time.

1194
01:19:29.839 --> 01:19:33.509
Mhm. Yeah, uh, actually, I mean, I think that,

1195
01:19:33.569 --> 01:19:36.549
uh, the, uh, as I said earlier, I mentioned

1196
01:19:36.549 --> 01:19:41.529
that I over time I distanced myself from some

1197
01:19:41.529 --> 01:19:45.330
of the arguments that David Benatar makes and when

1198
01:19:45.330 --> 01:19:49.850
he evaluates or he tries to evaluate the amount

1199
01:19:49.850 --> 01:19:55.486
of suffering that people objectively. Experience in their lives,

1200
01:19:55.537 --> 01:19:59.896
I mean, I don't really agree with him a

1201
01:19:59.896 --> 01:20:03.577
lot because I think that, uh, different people, I

1202
01:20:03.577 --> 01:20:06.696
mean, even if you don't want to consider, for

1203
01:20:06.696 --> 01:20:11.336
example, people resorting to religion or some other belief

1204
01:20:11.336 --> 01:20:15.146
system to give meaning to their suffering, there's, it's

1205
01:20:15.146 --> 01:20:19.003
still the case that. Different people have different personality

1206
01:20:19.003 --> 01:20:23.104
traits and because of the life experiences they are

1207
01:20:23.344 --> 01:20:28.164
exposed to, they might develop psychologically in different ways

1208
01:20:28.164 --> 01:20:35.233
and they don't evaluate uh similar life events, uh,

1209
01:20:35.244 --> 01:20:38.523
the, the same. I mean, uh, people have might

1210
01:20:38.523 --> 01:20:42.511
evaluate. THE same life event, two different people, one

1211
01:20:42.511 --> 01:20:45.800
might evaluate it as good or positive, the other

1212
01:20:45.800 --> 01:20:48.730
one might evaluate it as bad or negative. So

1213
01:20:49.110 --> 01:20:53.730
I don't, I think it's not really that easy

1214
01:20:53.730 --> 01:20:59.710
to talk about, um, objectively evaluating uh the good

1215
01:20:59.710 --> 01:21:01.690
and bad aspects of life.

1216
01:21:02.470 --> 01:21:05.180
Yeah, I agree, as I said also because the

1217
01:21:05.180 --> 01:21:08.660
same, the same reason can be for me a

1218
01:21:08.660 --> 01:21:11.779
huge pain for you. It's something that doesn't matter.

1219
01:21:11.859 --> 01:21:17.540
So I mean we cannot actually I like the

1220
01:21:17.540 --> 01:21:23.259
Venators least, but because I mean it's quite clear

1221
01:21:23.259 --> 01:21:26.459
for people we can, it's a way to say

1222
01:21:26.459 --> 01:21:29.000
there are so many reasons, of course we don't.

1223
01:21:29.645 --> 01:21:33.154
Feel the same the same features in the same

1224
01:21:33.154 --> 01:21:35.955
way, but it's a way to say the reason

1225
01:21:35.955 --> 01:21:40.354
for suffer and are so I mean are enough

1226
01:21:40.354 --> 01:21:44.714
and each person has its own reason to to.

1227
01:21:46.069 --> 01:21:50.149
So don't feel confident with life, maybe we can

1228
01:21:50.149 --> 01:21:51.049
say this.

1229
01:21:51.629 --> 01:21:55.640
Yeah, do you think of death as a harm,

1230
01:21:55.700 --> 01:21:58.229
or do you think that death is always a

1231
01:21:58.229 --> 01:21:58.790
harm?

1232
01:22:00.290 --> 01:22:05.560
If we definitely consider the final act, I will

1233
01:22:05.560 --> 01:22:07.959
say that it's not an arm in my opinion.

1234
01:22:08.040 --> 01:22:16.990
I think that. The death that that causes pain,

1235
01:22:17.069 --> 01:22:20.390
harm is the death as a process of dying.

1236
01:22:20.830 --> 01:22:25.629
So the awareness that, as I said before, each

1237
01:22:25.629 --> 01:22:31.629
day we lost something and we lost, we always

1238
01:22:31.629 --> 01:22:34.509
live the death of other people, and I think

1239
01:22:34.509 --> 01:22:38.259
that this is more painful than our death. So

1240
01:22:38.259 --> 01:22:41.529
in this way I would say. That it depends.

1241
01:22:41.589 --> 01:22:45.180
It depends on the way we want to consider

1242
01:22:45.180 --> 01:22:45.609
death.

1243
01:22:46.890 --> 01:22:49.649
Yeah, uh, I think that, I mean, in my

1244
01:22:49.649 --> 01:22:53.529
opinion or in my perspective, I think that it

1245
01:22:53.529 --> 01:22:59.629
is especially, you shouldn't consider that a harm. If

1246
01:22:59.629 --> 01:23:04.669
the person who wishes to die is suffering a

1247
01:23:04.669 --> 01:23:07.470
lot, I mean, I think that there are lives

1248
01:23:07.470 --> 01:23:12.589
out there that are so horrible, so terrible that

1249
01:23:12.589 --> 01:23:17.089
particularly if the person who is experiencing it wishes

1250
01:23:17.089 --> 01:23:21.709
that wants that death is actually something good in

1251
01:23:21.709 --> 01:23:23.080
those particular cases.

1252
01:23:24.029 --> 01:23:27.669
Yeah, I think that it's good, but uh and

1253
01:23:27.669 --> 01:23:30.350
it's also the topic of my bachelor's degree thesis,

1254
01:23:30.390 --> 01:23:34.709
as I said, so, but I'm considering maybe disease

1255
01:23:34.709 --> 01:23:37.790
and so the kind of end of life question

1256
01:23:37.790 --> 01:23:42.040
like euthanasia, assisted suicide. Yeah, of course death is,

1257
01:23:42.390 --> 01:23:44.259
I mean it's a way to solve the problem.

1258
01:23:44.629 --> 01:23:48.470
It's not something bad because, but in that case

1259
01:23:48.470 --> 01:23:53.790
I also say that. Maybe I quite radical, so

1260
01:23:53.790 --> 01:23:57.350
I, I don't, I, I speak about my perception

1261
01:23:57.350 --> 01:24:00.750
and the way I see the situation, but I

1262
01:24:00.750 --> 01:24:04.319
think that for people who suffer in that way,

1263
01:24:04.790 --> 01:24:08.129
their life is already finished. I mean, what uh

1264
01:24:08.129 --> 01:24:11.350
what remains remains the biological life, but it's not

1265
01:24:11.350 --> 01:24:15.029
the biograph bio biography, the life that we do

1266
01:24:16.310 --> 01:24:21.310
that one. That we live every day and that

1267
01:24:21.310 --> 01:24:23.899
we experience and that we enjoy in every day,

1268
01:24:24.109 --> 01:24:27.390
it's something that maybe it's not life anymore. We

1269
01:24:27.390 --> 01:24:32.859
cannot consider life as the fact that we breathe,

1270
01:24:33.500 --> 01:24:35.899
but so in that way I would say that

1271
01:24:36.759 --> 01:24:39.509
death becomes of course preferable. It's not an army,

1272
01:24:39.549 --> 01:24:42.569
it's a way to solve the problem of life.

1273
01:24:43.220 --> 01:24:46.470
Yeah, uh, what do you think are the ethical

1274
01:24:46.470 --> 01:24:50.470
questions surrounding parenthood that anti-atalism uh raises?

1275
01:24:53.470 --> 01:25:00.200
Uh, uh, uh, um, uh, MAYBE, uh. Yeah, maybe

1276
01:25:00.200 --> 01:25:05.560
I would say the the fact that they act

1277
01:25:05.560 --> 01:25:07.839
in a selfish way. I think that it's one

1278
01:25:07.839 --> 01:25:11.919
of the the first argument because it's also the

1279
01:25:11.919 --> 01:25:15.600
more it's one of the arguments that parents and

1280
01:25:15.600 --> 01:25:19.660
people don't consider when we speak about the the

1281
01:25:19.919 --> 01:25:22.200
the fact of bringing someone else into the world.

1282
01:25:22.600 --> 01:25:24.899
So I think that this is one of the

1283
01:25:26.479 --> 01:25:29.069
maybe one of the most difficult. But also one

1284
01:25:29.069 --> 01:25:33.250
of the most evident, we have to speak about

1285
01:25:34.109 --> 01:25:38.149
the fact that they decide, but they decide taking

1286
01:25:38.149 --> 01:25:43.109
into account their own position, their own perception, their

1287
01:25:43.109 --> 01:25:47.629
desire, and so maybe I would say that one.

1288
01:25:48.140 --> 01:25:51.779
And I also consider, but I know that it's

1289
01:25:51.779 --> 01:25:55.580
not so common, but sometimes it's happened that the

1290
01:25:55.580 --> 01:26:00.450
parents sometimes are not able to stay with the

1291
01:26:01.200 --> 01:26:04.540
with the children until they become adults, and this

1292
01:26:04.540 --> 01:26:09.149
is also a problem because we cannot. And they

1293
01:26:09.149 --> 01:26:11.470
are not sure to be able to say or

1294
01:26:11.470 --> 01:26:13.709
to say, even if they say, but to say

1295
01:26:13.709 --> 01:26:17.270
in the right way because sometimes there are many

1296
01:26:17.270 --> 01:26:22.549
problems in the relation and all these problems are,

1297
01:26:22.669 --> 01:26:26.149
in my opinion, something that we should take into

1298
01:26:26.149 --> 01:26:29.629
account when we speak about the relation between parents

1299
01:26:29.629 --> 01:26:32.899
and children. And first of all, the fact that

1300
01:26:33.500 --> 01:26:35.140
Even if I don't want to speak about the

1301
01:26:35.140 --> 01:26:38.910
consent, it remains a fact that they decide for

1302
01:26:38.910 --> 01:26:43.390
someone else and this person cannot decide for for

1303
01:26:43.390 --> 01:26:46.629
himself or herself about the life, so it remains

1304
01:26:46.629 --> 01:26:47.770
an asymmetry, of course.

1305
01:26:49.540 --> 01:26:53.250
Yes, and I, I mean, I think that um

1306
01:26:53.839 --> 01:26:58.100
actually all arguments, but at least most arguments used

1307
01:26:58.100 --> 01:27:03.740
by people to justify reproduction and to justify being

1308
01:27:03.740 --> 01:27:08.890
parents are not really. Very convincing because it's like

1309
01:27:08.890 --> 01:27:13.209
oh it's a biological impulse. OK, but we've already

1310
01:27:13.209 --> 01:27:15.890
went through, we've already gone through that, so that's

1311
01:27:15.890 --> 01:27:18.990
not a very good argument. Oh, it's because everyone

1312
01:27:19.410 --> 01:27:22.450
does it. I mean that's also not a very

1313
01:27:22.450 --> 01:27:26.189
good argument and. And uh another that I find

1314
01:27:26.189 --> 01:27:30.290
really selfish is, oh, because when I get old,

1315
01:27:30.549 --> 01:27:33.069
I want to have someone to take care of

1316
01:27:33.069 --> 01:27:36.229
me. Uh, OK, yeah, I can, I can understand

1317
01:27:36.229 --> 01:27:39.229
that, but it, it sounds very selfish because if

1318
01:27:39.229 --> 01:27:42.875
you think about it deeply, you're creating Creating a

1319
01:27:42.875 --> 01:27:49.104
new being, just thinking about yourself, just focusing on

1320
01:27:49.104 --> 01:27:52.794
your own future suffering, and you're putting him or

1321
01:27:52.794 --> 01:27:56.875
her through the huge risk of dealing with lots

1322
01:27:56.875 --> 01:27:59.955
of suffering in their own life just to take

1323
01:27:59.955 --> 01:28:00.674
care of you.

1324
01:28:01.080 --> 01:28:03.720
And you must not be sure because you don't

1325
01:28:03.720 --> 01:28:08.279
know what's happened with your kids. Maybe they they

1326
01:28:08.279 --> 01:28:10.879
die for some reason, they live in another country,

1327
01:28:10.959 --> 01:28:13.339
they are not available to stay with you until

1328
01:28:13.339 --> 01:28:16.640
you're uh you became older and older. I mean

1329
01:28:16.640 --> 01:28:19.680
there are so many evaluations on the future that

1330
01:28:20.100 --> 01:28:22.459
uh that we cannot establish before.

1331
01:28:23.439 --> 01:28:28.740
Yeah, uh, so what responsibilities do you think parents

1332
01:28:28.740 --> 01:28:32.439
have to their children because they brought to the

1333
01:28:32.439 --> 01:28:37.560
world new beings, new sentient beings, new human beings

1334
01:28:37.560 --> 01:28:41.859
particularly. I mean, what kinds of responsibilities do parents

1335
01:28:41.859 --> 01:28:44.240
have after they've done that?

1336
01:28:45.379 --> 01:28:50.229
Uh, I think that uh uh once they have

1337
01:28:50.229 --> 01:28:53.589
created a new, uh, a new living being, I

1338
01:28:53.589 --> 01:28:56.229
mean maybe of course for sentient beings it's quite

1339
01:28:56.229 --> 01:28:59.830
different because most of the parents after the generation

1340
01:28:59.830 --> 01:29:02.830
leave the uh the animal alone, so I mean

1341
01:29:02.830 --> 01:29:04.990
we can speak only about human beings in this

1342
01:29:04.990 --> 01:29:09.669
sense and I think that um yeah, the education,

1343
01:29:09.750 --> 01:29:13.109
the presence or the to be present to be

1344
01:29:13.109 --> 01:29:19.379
um. To try to give them the Best life,

1345
01:29:20.029 --> 01:29:23.589
but while I, I mean, I'm assessing it and

1346
01:29:23.589 --> 01:29:27.399
I'm saying about what, oh, so I'm not sure

1347
01:29:27.399 --> 01:29:30.069
about the reply I'm giving, but because I think

1348
01:29:30.069 --> 01:29:36.470
that they have many responsibility and but at the

1349
01:29:36.470 --> 01:29:43.500
same time. The only responsibilities that uh uh. I

1350
01:29:43.500 --> 01:29:45.720
mean it's what I want to say is that

1351
01:29:45.720 --> 01:29:48.580
it's, it cannot, we can maybe we cannot speak

1352
01:29:48.580 --> 01:29:51.620
about responsibility because if even if they do something

1353
01:29:51.620 --> 01:29:56.939
and they do their best for give to his

1354
01:29:56.939 --> 01:29:59.700
or her child the best future and the best

1355
01:29:59.700 --> 01:30:03.479
life. We cannot know, as we said before, so

1356
01:30:05.020 --> 01:30:09.709
I think that yeah, the responsibility is maybe to

1357
01:30:09.709 --> 01:30:16.850
be present and to to prevent to prevent from

1358
01:30:17.770 --> 01:30:22.040
from harm, from pain, but it's a kind of

1359
01:30:22.259 --> 01:30:26.060
abstract reply because as we said they are not

1360
01:30:26.060 --> 01:30:27.770
sure to be able to do it.

1361
01:30:28.700 --> 01:30:31.350
Yeah, and I think it's, there's a very important

1362
01:30:31.350 --> 01:30:34.910
point for us to make here, particularly for people

1363
01:30:34.910 --> 01:30:38.149
who will be watching our conversation who are not

1364
01:30:38.149 --> 01:30:43.669
anti-natalists because there's many misconceptions out there about anti-atalism

1365
01:30:43.669 --> 01:30:46.830
that people make, and one of them is they

1366
01:30:46.830 --> 01:30:51.470
think that because we are against reproduction or we

1367
01:30:51.470 --> 01:30:55.470
think that reproduction is immoral, that we are, we

1368
01:30:55.470 --> 01:30:59.515
are anti. Children, but that's not the case because

1369
01:30:59.515 --> 01:31:03.955
the children that already exist, they should be taken

1370
01:31:03.955 --> 01:31:07.935
care of, right? And for example, some, someone might

1371
01:31:07.935 --> 01:31:10.674
not reproduce, but if they want to become a

1372
01:31:10.674 --> 01:31:14.595
stepparent to take care of an orphan, that's perfect.

1373
01:31:14.794 --> 01:31:17.375
I mean that that's not just ethical, but it's

1374
01:31:17.515 --> 01:31:20.354
moral to do that, right? I mean to take

1375
01:31:20.354 --> 01:31:23.794
care of people who already exist, particularly children who

1376
01:31:23.794 --> 01:31:24.714
are vulnerable,

1377
01:31:24.955 --> 01:31:27.799
right? Yeah, yeah, this is, uh, this is true,

1378
01:31:27.839 --> 01:31:31.439
of course, the anti-natalism does not mean that we

1379
01:31:31.439 --> 01:31:34.040
should stop the life of the child, the children

1380
01:31:34.040 --> 01:31:37.600
who already exist, and uh, but I think that

1381
01:31:37.600 --> 01:31:42.459
is the responsibility, um, the responsibility or the normal

1382
01:31:42.459 --> 01:31:45.759
responsibility that each party. And not only the parents,

1383
01:31:45.810 --> 01:31:50.290
each person must have to the other, and sometimes

1384
01:31:50.290 --> 01:31:53.680
maybe it's not to take care of everyone, but

1385
01:31:54.330 --> 01:31:59.160
there is a kind of attention to the needs,

1386
01:31:59.290 --> 01:32:05.609
to the what she yeah, to the life she's

1387
01:32:05.609 --> 01:32:10.189
going to to to live, but yeah, of course

1388
01:32:10.189 --> 01:32:15.379
1880 it's. Uh, IT'S so, I mean, he wants

1389
01:32:15.379 --> 01:32:18.529
to stop procreation, try to explain the reason, but,

1390
01:32:18.540 --> 01:32:22.299
uh, uh, it, uh, uh, it does not entail

1391
01:32:22.299 --> 01:32:25.220
with the life of the already living being, of

1392
01:32:25.220 --> 01:32:25.759
course.

1393
01:32:26.379 --> 01:32:29.740
Yeah, but, but would you say, uh, or do

1394
01:32:29.740 --> 01:32:35.660
you think antenatalists should say explicitly that becoming a

1395
01:32:35.660 --> 01:32:37.959
parent is immoral?

1396
01:32:39.279 --> 01:32:43.009
Uh, YES, for the reason we discussed, I would

1397
01:32:43.009 --> 01:32:48.410
say, um, yes, uh, but, uh, yeah, I think

1398
01:32:48.410 --> 01:32:48.910
yes.

1399
01:32:49.709 --> 01:32:53.350
Mhm. Um, uh, LET, let me, uh, ask you

1400
01:32:53.350 --> 01:32:57.569
about other related, uh, things. I think, I mean,

1401
01:32:57.669 --> 01:33:00.790
things that we can relate to antenatalism but are

1402
01:33:00.790 --> 01:33:08.169
not directly anti-natalist. So how does antenatalism approach assisted

1403
01:33:08.350 --> 01:33:09.229
fertilization?

1404
01:33:10.580 --> 01:33:11.310
Uh, REPEAT.

1405
01:33:12.109 --> 01:33:16.500
How does antenatalism approach assisted fertilization?

1406
01:33:17.930 --> 01:33:23.189
Uh, OK, I would say that, uh, as for

1407
01:33:23.189 --> 01:33:28.430
the fertilization, uh, it depends on what uh what

1408
01:33:28.430 --> 01:33:33.310
we want to describe with fertilization because when I

1409
01:33:33.310 --> 01:33:36.589
consider this topic in my book, I consider, I

1410
01:33:36.589 --> 01:33:40.649
started from a particular novel and the engineering. On

1411
01:33:40.649 --> 01:33:45.240
the DNA and I think that many people consider

1412
01:33:45.240 --> 01:33:49.810
that if we were able to modify this engineering

1413
01:33:49.810 --> 01:33:53.279
the DNA we can build up a living being,

1414
01:33:53.319 --> 01:33:56.259
a new human being which will be able to

1415
01:33:57.120 --> 01:34:00.080
not to suffer, and I think that also in

1416
01:34:00.080 --> 01:34:02.919
this way it represents a selfish way to. Build

1417
01:34:02.919 --> 01:34:08.669
up the child, the new human beings in the

1418
01:34:08.669 --> 01:34:11.149
way you are. The novel I have in mind

1419
01:34:11.149 --> 01:34:14.660
is Ishiguro's novel Clara and the Sun, and there

1420
01:34:14.669 --> 01:34:19.990
there was a particular history and in which you

1421
01:34:19.990 --> 01:34:22.870
can, you can see, you can read, you can

1422
01:34:22.870 --> 01:34:28.149
understand the selfish reason behind parenthood. So the also

1423
01:34:28.149 --> 01:34:37.589
the. This kind of DNA engineering show and confirms

1424
01:34:37.589 --> 01:34:44.500
the egoistic way because we can we decide how

1425
01:34:44.500 --> 01:34:48.459
he must appear and what quality and I mean

1426
01:34:49.700 --> 01:34:53.339
I think it's only a confirmation of the. Traveling

1427
01:34:53.339 --> 01:34:54.419
of parenthood,

1428
01:34:55.060 --> 01:34:59.100
yeah, uh, and how about suicide? I mean earlier

1429
01:34:59.100 --> 01:35:01.620
we talked about death and whether it is always

1430
01:35:01.620 --> 01:35:05.009
a harm or not, and, and I think that

1431
01:35:05.020 --> 01:35:08.379
we both agree that sometimes it's not, it's not

1432
01:35:08.379 --> 01:35:10.939
only not a harm, but it's also a good

1433
01:35:10.939 --> 01:35:14.700
thing to die, at least in some situations, but

1434
01:35:14.700 --> 01:35:19.700
uh suicide specifically, do you think that anti-atalism has

1435
01:35:19.700 --> 01:35:22.020
something to say about it ethically?

1436
01:35:23.580 --> 01:35:26.939
Yes, I would say that we should discuss about

1437
01:35:26.939 --> 01:35:32.149
suicide because I mean if we are saying that

1438
01:35:32.419 --> 01:35:34.620
it would have been better not to be into

1439
01:35:34.620 --> 01:35:36.759
the world, not to come into the world, then

1440
01:35:37.140 --> 01:35:40.765
it's normal to say, OK, if we If we

1441
01:35:40.765 --> 01:35:42.964
should not have been into the war, then we

1442
01:35:42.964 --> 01:35:47.564
should go away. We should commit suicide and so

1443
01:35:47.564 --> 01:35:52.424
I think that 1880s should deal with this topic,

1444
01:35:52.564 --> 01:35:58.319
and I think that the reply. The possible reply

1445
01:35:58.319 --> 01:36:02.149
are two because on the one hand, of course

1446
01:36:02.149 --> 01:36:06.839
we cannot compare the not procreation with the suicide

1447
01:36:06.839 --> 01:36:09.029
because in the middle there is the life, the

1448
01:36:09.029 --> 01:36:13.919
life that we have that we try to to

1449
01:36:13.919 --> 01:36:16.839
build up in the best way we can, and

1450
01:36:16.839 --> 01:36:21.209
on the other side I'll say that starting from

1451
01:36:21.209 --> 01:36:23.640
the idea that not to be into the world,

1452
01:36:23.759 --> 01:36:28.080
it would be preferable. Maybe we cannot judge in

1453
01:36:28.080 --> 01:36:31.000
a negative way the suicide. I mean suicide remains

1454
01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:35.080
a possibility, an act that men can commit, can

1455
01:36:35.080 --> 01:36:38.080
decide to do, and I think that the people

1456
01:36:38.080 --> 01:36:43.080
who decide to do to commit this this big

1457
01:36:43.080 --> 01:36:46.839
way to die because you must go against your

1458
01:36:46.839 --> 01:36:51.419
life. It's quite, it must be respect because it

1459
01:36:51.419 --> 01:36:54.580
means that the reason for which you prefer to

1460
01:36:54.580 --> 01:37:00.660
die, they must be, even enough that you prefer

1461
01:37:00.660 --> 01:37:04.049
to stop your life. So this is what I

1462
01:37:04.049 --> 01:37:04.580
would say.

1463
01:37:05.080 --> 01:37:09.479
Mhm. Uh, WHAT do you think are the strongest

1464
01:37:09.479 --> 01:37:13.319
arguments against anti-natalism? I mean, what do you think

1465
01:37:13.319 --> 01:37:17.089
are the arguments that when you are exposed to

1466
01:37:17.089 --> 01:37:21.640
them against anti-natalism are the hardest to tackle?

1467
01:37:23.180 --> 01:37:28.220
Uh, I can distinguish because if I consider the

1468
01:37:28.879 --> 01:37:35.430
reply that other people maybe told me when we

1469
01:37:35.430 --> 01:37:38.279
when I was in some conversation, I would say

1470
01:37:38.279 --> 01:37:42.479
that most of them say that they refuse the

1471
01:37:42.479 --> 01:37:45.759
role of suffering or they refuse to consider suffering

1472
01:37:45.759 --> 01:37:48.799
as a main reason as we say it and

1473
01:37:48.799 --> 01:37:55.330
also the. That procreation is something that we cannot

1474
01:37:55.330 --> 01:37:58.890
control because it's nature or that life is beautiful,

1475
01:37:59.209 --> 01:38:06.959
and but from the metaphy perspective now. I'm considering

1476
01:38:06.959 --> 01:38:09.189
some of these topics, for example, the role of

1477
01:38:09.189 --> 01:38:13.879
the necessity, and because one of the features of

1478
01:38:13.879 --> 01:38:17.359
the Greek philosophy, and in my opinion there is

1479
01:38:17.359 --> 01:38:23.549
a metaphysical perspective there is that. They have to

1480
01:38:23.549 --> 01:38:27.350
accept the role of the necessity of Ananke, so

1481
01:38:27.350 --> 01:38:31.189
they cannot decide to stop procreation. They must accept

1482
01:38:31.189 --> 01:38:33.790
that the world is in this way. So maybe

1483
01:38:33.790 --> 01:38:38.109
my question is that from this perspective, anti-atalism is

1484
01:38:38.109 --> 01:38:41.490
still possible. I mean we can be quite aware

1485
01:38:41.490 --> 01:38:44.560
of the suffering or all the stuff as the

1486
01:38:44.560 --> 01:38:51.109
Greek philosophy. And or the poets and but why

1487
01:38:51.109 --> 01:38:53.270
we don't stop, I mean maybe there are some

1488
01:38:53.270 --> 01:39:01.830
other concept forces that we should consider and forces

1489
01:39:01.830 --> 01:39:06.390
that of course depends that are independent from us

1490
01:39:06.390 --> 01:39:09.310
so that we cannot control and apart from all

1491
01:39:09.310 --> 01:39:12.939
I would say that. It's strange maybe as a

1492
01:39:12.939 --> 01:39:15.379
reply, but I would say that life itself is

1493
01:39:15.379 --> 01:39:19.819
an argument against the 1980s because if we consider

1494
01:39:19.819 --> 01:39:23.279
the life of people, they find they establish meaning,

1495
01:39:23.459 --> 01:39:27.160
they have some aim, and the mechanisms to defend.

1496
01:39:27.410 --> 01:39:30.089
So maybe there are many reasons for which is

1497
01:39:30.089 --> 01:39:33.450
life itself that is in a um which is

1498
01:39:33.450 --> 01:39:38.370
not able to see the er the the meaning

1499
01:39:38.370 --> 01:39:41.930
of anti-natalism to the meaning of life, the reality

1500
01:39:41.930 --> 01:39:43.029
of life I would say.

1501
01:39:43.890 --> 01:39:48.209
Mhm. Do you think that anti-atalism is a humanist

1502
01:39:48.209 --> 01:39:48.990
philosophy?

1503
01:39:51.669 --> 01:39:56.709
If a human we intend to hit concerns with

1504
01:39:56.709 --> 01:40:01.350
human beings, I would say yes. I would prefer

1505
01:40:01.350 --> 01:40:06.109
to speak about philanthropy, and, but if you say

1506
01:40:06.109 --> 01:40:11.390
it's for humanistic, we consider the fact that it

1507
01:40:11.390 --> 01:40:15.569
wants to defend in some way human beings. I

1508
01:40:15.569 --> 01:40:19.169
would say that it's not humanistic because of course

1509
01:40:19.169 --> 01:40:23.529
it's he he don't want to er to find

1510
01:40:23.529 --> 01:40:25.930
a way to keep human beings into life. It's

1511
01:40:25.930 --> 01:40:28.490
a way to say that human beings and human

1512
01:40:28.490 --> 01:40:30.069
life is something wrong.

1513
01:40:30.839 --> 01:40:35.839
Mhm. Uh, WHAT do you think about extinctionism? Because

1514
01:40:35.839 --> 01:40:42.759
many times people associate antenatalism to extinctionism. I mean,

1515
01:40:42.839 --> 01:40:46.270
uh, are you also a proponent of that and

1516
01:40:46.549 --> 01:40:49.879
do you think that antenatalism goes hand in hand

1517
01:40:49.879 --> 01:40:54.879
with extinctionism or do you, uh, break them apart?

1518
01:40:56.410 --> 01:41:01.060
I would say that um I'm not a proponent

1519
01:41:01.060 --> 01:41:04.459
of anti-natalism, but because anyone is a proponent of

1520
01:41:04.459 --> 01:41:11.620
anti-natalism because of the fact that of. Extinctionism, uh,

1521
01:41:11.720 --> 01:41:15.479
I'm not a proponent of extinctionism and that any

1522
01:41:15.479 --> 01:41:19.609
people is a proponent of extinctionism, but because extinction

1523
01:41:19.609 --> 01:41:22.959
is a fact, it's something that will happen in

1524
01:41:22.959 --> 01:41:25.160
the future. We don't know when, but it will

1525
01:41:25.160 --> 01:41:29.220
go up, so I think that uh we can,

1526
01:41:29.240 --> 01:41:31.160
we can, yeah, we can agree, we can disagree,

1527
01:41:31.200 --> 01:41:33.910
but it's going to happen, and this is my

1528
01:41:33.910 --> 01:41:38.189
perception. So what I try to discuss and to.

1529
01:41:38.370 --> 01:41:41.839
Uh, TO, to see, to, to write, to think

1530
01:41:41.839 --> 01:41:47.399
is that we should maybe only renovate this factual

1531
01:41:47.399 --> 01:41:49.850
truth that we are going to extinct, and I

1532
01:41:49.850 --> 01:41:55.250
think that ancient, maybe it moves in this direction

1533
01:41:55.250 --> 01:41:57.850
because we should consider that we are going to

1534
01:41:57.850 --> 01:42:01.419
pass away as a species and. Not because we

1535
01:42:01.419 --> 01:42:03.459
are bad, we are not able to stay into

1536
01:42:03.459 --> 01:42:06.419
the world, but because every other living beings and

1537
01:42:06.419 --> 01:42:10.129
every other beings we are going to pass and

1538
01:42:10.129 --> 01:42:13.850
new living beings may come into the world, and

1539
01:42:14.270 --> 01:42:16.580
but I think that it's true. It's I mean

1540
01:42:17.979 --> 01:42:21.270
how to say the the modern philosopher, it's a

1541
01:42:21.270 --> 01:42:26.540
matter of fact. It's it's something real evident.

1542
01:42:27.490 --> 01:42:29.970
Yeah, I, I mean, I agree. I think that

1543
01:42:29.970 --> 01:42:34.290
it's just inevitable even if we as humans through

1544
01:42:34.290 --> 01:42:39.770
our own actions do not lead ourselves to our

1545
01:42:39.770 --> 01:42:43.720
own extinction. I mean, whether by I mean, er,

1546
01:42:43.729 --> 01:42:47.140
altering the environment in ways that we are no

1547
01:42:47.140 --> 01:42:52.870
longer able to survive, or through nuclear war, or

1548
01:42:52.870 --> 01:42:56.640
through, I don't know, super intelligent AI or something

1549
01:42:56.640 --> 01:42:59.100
like that. I mean, even if we don't do

1550
01:42:59.100 --> 01:43:03.132
that to ourselves just from a biological perspective. If

1551
01:43:03.132 --> 01:43:07.183
it's inevitable that we will evolve into other species

1552
01:43:07.183 --> 01:43:10.453
eventually, so humans at a certain point will no

1553
01:43:10.453 --> 01:43:14.493
longer exist as humans, at least, or I mean

1554
01:43:14.493 --> 01:43:20.092
from a physics standpoint, there's lots of evidence that

1555
01:43:20.092 --> 01:43:23.405
somewhere in the future, even if it is. Trillions

1556
01:43:23.405 --> 01:43:26.886
of years, trillions of years in the future, there

1557
01:43:26.886 --> 01:43:31.166
will be a time will arrive where the universe

1558
01:43:31.166 --> 01:43:34.465
can no longer sustain life. And so I mean

1559
01:43:35.286 --> 01:43:38.226
it doesn't matter what kind of perspective you take,

1560
01:43:38.525 --> 01:43:42.045
we're just going to go extinct somewhere in the

1561
01:43:42.045 --> 01:43:43.085
future, right?

1562
01:43:44.160 --> 01:43:47.330
Yeah, yeah, and also I was also thinking that

1563
01:43:47.330 --> 01:43:50.529
life was not present from the beginning, so I

1564
01:43:50.529 --> 01:43:55.049
mean it seems that we, we, I mean it's

1565
01:43:55.049 --> 01:43:57.890
not the right term, but we wait until the

1566
01:43:57.890 --> 01:44:02.640
conditions were good for the life and. Of course

1567
01:44:02.640 --> 01:44:05.600
in the future the conditions may be changed, but

1568
01:44:05.600 --> 01:44:10.609
not because man is responsible for the climate change

1569
01:44:10.720 --> 01:44:15.379
and all the the fight are all arguments interesting,

1570
01:44:15.470 --> 01:44:19.560
but I think that before all this trouble it

1571
01:44:19.560 --> 01:44:23.399
happens because it's in the natural evolution of the

1572
01:44:23.399 --> 01:44:26.560
world. I also consider that now there are some

1573
01:44:26.560 --> 01:44:29.979
transhumanistic positions that consider that we will be able

1574
01:44:29.979 --> 01:44:35.149
to. To overcome the problem of death, yeah, maybe,

1575
01:44:35.270 --> 01:44:38.549
but then what we, I think that the result

1576
01:44:38.549 --> 01:44:42.049
will be something which is not human anymore. So

1577
01:44:42.049 --> 01:44:44.149
also in this way it's a kind of extinction

1578
01:44:44.149 --> 01:44:47.950
of human beings in the way in the way

1579
01:44:47.950 --> 01:44:48.770
we are now.

1580
01:44:49.890 --> 01:44:51.850
Yeah, you know, and I mean this is just

1581
01:44:51.850 --> 01:44:55.189
my position, but I'm very skeptical when it comes

1582
01:44:55.189 --> 01:44:58.979
to transhumanism that claim about us being able to

1583
01:44:58.979 --> 01:45:01.430
live forever. I mean, I think that there are

1584
01:45:01.770 --> 01:45:05.129
clear biological limits, and, and I mean, and the

1585
01:45:05.129 --> 01:45:08.515
forever beat, I mean, Even if you become a

1586
01:45:08.515 --> 01:45:12.154
transhuman again, there will arrive a time in the

1587
01:45:12.154 --> 01:45:16.095
future where the universe will no longer be able

1588
01:45:16.095 --> 01:45:20.774
to sustain life in whatever form. So I mean

1589
01:45:20.774 --> 01:45:26.240
you won't be there forever anyway, so. Yeah, so

1590
01:45:26.240 --> 01:45:29.399
let me just ask you one final question. How

1591
01:45:29.399 --> 01:45:33.439
do you think we should approach people when telling

1592
01:45:33.439 --> 01:45:38.479
them about anti-natalism, people who are not anti-Nalists themselves,

1593
01:45:38.879 --> 01:45:44.020
people who perhaps haven't even heard about anti-natalism before.

1594
01:45:44.750 --> 01:45:51.379
Mhm. What's uh I had my professor at the

1595
01:45:51.379 --> 01:45:54.819
beginning of my when I started to study this

1596
01:45:54.819 --> 01:45:58.410
topic, I tried to convince people and my professor

1597
01:45:58.410 --> 01:46:01.140
one time told me you don't have to convince

1598
01:46:01.140 --> 01:46:05.040
anyone. You, you, what you can do is only

1599
01:46:05.040 --> 01:46:08.890
to try to explain the reason of the 1880s,

1600
01:46:09.009 --> 01:46:11.660
try to be the more clear you can and

1601
01:46:11.660 --> 01:46:17.015
to. You know, you you find argument to explain,

1602
01:46:17.115 --> 01:46:22.375
to say why the anti-atism is a philosophical perspective

1603
01:46:22.375 --> 01:46:29.194
and it's a respectable perspective. Then because this depends

1604
01:46:29.194 --> 01:46:33.064
on me, then the people can decide to accept

1605
01:46:33.064 --> 01:46:36.314
it, to criticize, but I don't have to convince

1606
01:46:36.314 --> 01:46:39.375
anyone, and I think it's true. It's something that

1607
01:46:40.310 --> 01:46:43.430
Now I'm learning to do. I think that we

1608
01:46:43.430 --> 01:46:47.350
can only try to be clear, try to justify

1609
01:46:47.350 --> 01:46:49.870
the reason of our position, and I mean the

1610
01:46:49.870 --> 01:46:53.029
reasons are evident, but maybe we have to explain

1611
01:46:53.029 --> 01:46:58.189
it and then I think that there are people

1612
01:46:58.189 --> 01:47:05.955
who may will be interested and studies and and

1613
01:47:05.955 --> 01:47:09.555
maybe they agree with anti-natalists and people who probably

1614
01:47:09.555 --> 01:47:15.875
prefer other positions as for every perspective, philosophical perspective,

1615
01:47:15.915 --> 01:47:19.395
but I would say every perspective in general, so

1616
01:47:19.395 --> 01:47:20.234
that one maybe.

1617
01:47:21.470 --> 01:47:24.509
Yeah, great. So, uh, let me just tell the

1618
01:47:24.509 --> 01:47:28.779
audience that the book is again Ail Nachereke Nonchiboleva

1619
01:47:28.779 --> 01:47:32.830
Story Theoria de Antinatalismmo. Uh, AS I said, my

1620
01:47:32.830 --> 01:47:36.189
translation, my personal translation is it's the birth we

1621
01:47:36.189 --> 01:47:39.509
didn't want history and theory of antenatalism. I will

1622
01:47:39.509 --> 01:47:41.950
be leaving a link to it in the description

1623
01:47:41.950 --> 01:47:44.870
of the interview, and Sarah, uh, apart from the

1624
01:47:44.870 --> 01:47:47.950
book, uh, are there any places on the internet

1625
01:47:47.950 --> 01:47:50.850
where people can find you and your work?

1626
01:47:51.899 --> 01:47:55.950
Uh, I have the, uh, personal website, uh, in

1627
01:47:55.950 --> 01:47:58.669
the, uh, maybe I can share with you the

1628
01:47:58.669 --> 01:48:01.990
link and uh on reserved gate and on the,

1629
01:48:02.379 --> 01:48:04.270
yeah, my personal page with the university.

1630
01:48:05.120 --> 01:48:07.959
Yeah. Uh, GREAT. So, uh, I mean, uh, just

1631
01:48:07.959 --> 01:48:10.520
before we finish, let me just say that this

1632
01:48:10.520 --> 01:48:14.669
is one of my favorite books of 2025. Uh,

1633
01:48:14.680 --> 01:48:17.959
uh, uh, BY the end of the year, I,

1634
01:48:18.020 --> 01:48:22.399
uh, since 2021, I've been doing posts every, every

1635
01:48:22.399 --> 01:48:25.430
year with my favorite nonfiction books of the year,

1636
01:48:25.439 --> 01:48:27.516
and this one. It is going to be up

1637
01:48:27.516 --> 01:48:30.235
there for sure. And I mean it, I mean,

1638
01:48:30.315 --> 01:48:34.315
it's in Italian. Come on guys, learn Italian to

1639
01:48:34.315 --> 01:48:37.715
read this book. If you ever wanted an excuse

1640
01:48:37.715 --> 01:48:40.436
or a reason to learn Italian, this is a

1641
01:48:40.436 --> 01:48:44.155
good enough reason. Also, there's the book by Doctor

1642
01:48:44.155 --> 01:48:47.875
Alberto Cervi that I'm going to interview just this

1643
01:48:47.875 --> 01:48:50.952
week. As well, techno panico, and uh that it's

1644
01:48:50.952 --> 01:48:53.151
an excellent book. We have to read Italian because

1645
01:48:53.151 --> 01:48:55.912
I'm going to put up two Italian books on

1646
01:48:55.912 --> 01:48:58.191
my list this year and you don't, if you

1647
01:48:58.191 --> 01:49:01.021
don't, uh, if you can't read Italian, you can't

1648
01:49:01.021 --> 01:49:03.682
read them. Come on, just go and learn Italians.

1649
01:49:04.231 --> 01:49:06.631
And Sarah, thank you, thank you so much for

1650
01:49:06.631 --> 01:49:09.461
