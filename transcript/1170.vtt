00:00:00.449 --> 00:00:03.309
Hello, everyone. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:03.309 --> 00:00:06.369
Dissenter. I'm your host, as always, Ricardo Lopes, and

3
00:00:06.369 --> 00:00:09.449
today I'm joined by Doctor Walter Scheidel. He is

4
00:00:09.449 --> 00:00:12.729
Dickinson Professor in the Humanities and professor of History

5
00:00:12.729 --> 00:00:16.690
at Stanford University. And today we're talking about his

6
00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:21.649
most recent book, What Is Ancient History. So, Doctor

7
00:00:21.649 --> 00:00:24.170
Scheidel, welcome to the show. It's a pleasure to

8
00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.500
everyone.

9
00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.309
Thank you for having me. So,

10
00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:31.920
uh, we're going to go through the main arguments

11
00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.560
that you present in the book when, in regards

12
00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:39.040
to how we deal with so-called ancient history and

13
00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:41.799
even what that means, but to start off with,

14
00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:45.479
why do you think that studies of ancient history

15
00:00:45.479 --> 00:00:50.479
tend to be so restrictive and focused almost exclusively

16
00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:51.810
on Rome and

17
00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:54.849
Greece? I think there are a number of reasons.

18
00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:57.330
It hasn't always been like this. So if you

19
00:00:57.330 --> 00:00:59.529
go back a few centuries, even in Europe, even

20
00:00:59.529 --> 00:01:02.529
in Western Europe, when people looked at antiquity, they

21
00:01:02.529 --> 00:01:04.250
would not just look at the Greeks and Romans,

22
00:01:04.319 --> 00:01:06.000
they would look at the Hebrew tradition and the

23
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.889
Old Testament, what little was known about Egypt, and

24
00:01:08.889 --> 00:01:12.089
so on. And then gradually over time everything became

25
00:01:12.089 --> 00:01:14.800
more and more concentrated on Greece and Rome. And

26
00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:17.529
it was partly because there had always been a

27
00:01:17.529 --> 00:01:21.250
sense of uh uh some cultural lineage, um, if

28
00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:23.730
you will, reaching from antiquity to the Middle Ages

29
00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:26.650
to the Renaissance to modern, uh, Europe and the

30
00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:30.050
West more generally. But there was also a revival

31
00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:32.690
in a way, uh, in the late 18th century,

32
00:01:32.769 --> 00:01:35.709
early 19th century, that was tied up with romanticism.

33
00:01:36.309 --> 00:01:41.599
Uh, NASCENT nationalism, colonialism, racism, all these things that

34
00:01:41.599 --> 00:01:45.319
became more prominent in that particular period, where Europeans

35
00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:48.809
in particular decided that the only worthy ancestors for

36
00:01:48.809 --> 00:01:51.449
themselves were the Greeks and Romans. They, the Europeans,

37
00:01:51.459 --> 00:01:53.720
were really special, and so the Greeks and Romans

38
00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:55.720
had to be special too, and there was some

39
00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:59.519
kind of special kinship, some special affinity between them

40
00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:02.900
and those two select ancient cultures, and that's when

41
00:02:03.279 --> 00:02:08.740
the current Organizational structures were created, universities, fields, disciplines,

42
00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:11.460
and so on. So to some extent, the result

43
00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:14.259
of this narrowing is still with us and hasn't

44
00:02:14.259 --> 00:02:15.800
really been properly overcome.

45
00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:20.500
But when we use the term ancient uh uh

46
00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:24.320
applied to the kinds of civilizations we are referring

47
00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:28.059
to, what kinds of attitudes does it denote? I

48
00:02:28.059 --> 00:02:31.899
mean, is it disdain, is it admiration or something

49
00:02:31.899 --> 00:02:32.360
else?

50
00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:35.619
We are stuck with that particular label because hundreds

51
00:02:35.619 --> 00:02:39.029
of years ago, calling something ancient was a term

52
00:02:39.029 --> 00:02:42.550
of approval, of veneration, right? The ancients are people

53
00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:44.509
who have much to teach us and they're really

54
00:02:44.509 --> 00:02:47.320
grand and glorious. And then about 200 years ago

55
00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:50.360
in English, at any rate, a new expression appears,

56
00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:53.919
which is that's ancient history, and that's something you

57
00:02:53.919 --> 00:02:56.320
say when you want to dismiss something as irrelevant

58
00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:58.860
or obsolete. And that's, it's not by coincidence that

59
00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:01.300
it shows up in the early 19th century with

60
00:03:01.479 --> 00:03:05.039
increasing modernization, um, and so on, but we're now

61
00:03:05.039 --> 00:03:08.600
stuck with this. So when most people, non-academics, I

62
00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:12.369
think, use the term ancient now. Uh, THEY don't

63
00:03:12.369 --> 00:03:15.470
necessarily attribute any positive connotations to that. They think

64
00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:18.940
of something a long time ago, doesn't matter anymore.

65
00:03:19.059 --> 00:03:21.169
Why should we care? So it's a bit of

66
00:03:21.169 --> 00:03:23.309
a burden in a way, even for the academic

67
00:03:23.309 --> 00:03:26.490
field, um, to teach something called ancient history.

68
00:03:28.809 --> 00:03:33.889
So, but what does the term ancient history really

69
00:03:33.889 --> 00:03:36.369
mean? What does it refer to? And this is

70
00:03:36.369 --> 00:03:40.869
the history of the peoples from, as I mentioned

71
00:03:40.869 --> 00:03:44.009
at the as I mentioned at the beginning, from

72
00:03:44.009 --> 00:03:47.410
mostly Greece and Rome from a few 1000 years

73
00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:50.500
ago, the true ancient, ancient history.

74
00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:54.110
Yeah, I mean, there's no standard definition, as you

75
00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:56.309
say, many people will think of some Greece and

76
00:03:56.389 --> 00:03:59.309
Romema. Greece and Rome and their predecessors, Egypt, Mesopotamia,

77
00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:01.669
and so on. Some people will think of early

78
00:04:01.669 --> 00:04:04.550
China, early India. Very few people, if any, will

79
00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:07.705
think of Central Eurasia or the Americas. My My

80
00:04:07.705 --> 00:04:11.375
view is that ancient history is a global phenomenon,

81
00:04:11.455 --> 00:04:13.925
that's something that happened all around the world, not

82
00:04:13.925 --> 00:04:16.945
literally everywhere, but in many parts of the globe

83
00:04:17.135 --> 00:04:20.565
at different times, at different speeds, in different places.

84
00:04:20.975 --> 00:04:23.940
We shouldn't think of it as a period. That

85
00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:26.940
is defined by a starting year and an end

86
00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:29.500
year. We should think of it as a phase

87
00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:33.980
of development, of transformative development, when people in different

88
00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:36.739
parts of the globe independently of one another to

89
00:04:36.739 --> 00:04:40.700
a large extent, came up with similar innovations and

90
00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:43.779
bundled them together in ways that will determine the

91
00:04:43.779 --> 00:04:46.260
way we live today. That I think is the

92
00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:50.899
broadest and most reasonable definition, if you will, of

93
00:04:50.899 --> 00:04:51.959
ancient history.

94
00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:55.459
Yeah, we will come back to that point you

95
00:04:55.459 --> 00:04:58.820
made about the ancient history being a global phenomenon

96
00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:01.859
later in our conversation, but what would you say

97
00:05:01.859 --> 00:05:06.140
are the main difficulties and obstacles when studying the

98
00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:07.299
ancient past?

99
00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:11.480
I think there are at least 31 is the

100
00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:14.000
nature of the evidence of the data we have

101
00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.519
to say anything at all, because it's of course

102
00:05:16.519 --> 00:05:19.029
not like modern data. We have a super abundance

103
00:05:19.029 --> 00:05:22.269
of information, archives, and all kinds of things. Often

104
00:05:22.269 --> 00:05:26.079
in early societies there is some writing, little writing,

105
00:05:26.239 --> 00:05:28.959
no writing in some cases. There is archaeology, which

106
00:05:28.959 --> 00:05:32.119
is difficult to decipher, so it's the overall amount

107
00:05:32.119 --> 00:05:35.700
and quality of the evidence. The second issue is

108
00:05:35.799 --> 00:05:39.119
gaining access to that evidence. Even if they are

109
00:05:39.119 --> 00:05:41.709
written texts, they are written in languages that for

110
00:05:41.709 --> 00:05:43.959
the most part no longer exist. They have to

111
00:05:43.959 --> 00:05:46.320
be deciphered. They have to be understood properly. You

112
00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:49.470
have to establish the vocabulary. Once it comes to

113
00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:53.390
archaeology, interpretation is necessarily ambiguous, right? There are different

114
00:05:53.390 --> 00:05:57.630
ways of interpreting certain material remains, so that's a

115
00:05:57.630 --> 00:06:02.230
big issue. And the third one, I think is

116
00:06:02.230 --> 00:06:06.309
that early societies are meaningfully different from the societies.

117
00:06:06.654 --> 00:06:09.325
We live in and that we are used to,

118
00:06:09.625 --> 00:06:13.234
so our basic intuitions as to how things work

119
00:06:13.535 --> 00:06:16.765
don't necessarily apply when we go back far enough

120
00:06:16.765 --> 00:06:19.135
into the past. So you have a trifecta of

121
00:06:19.135 --> 00:06:21.575
problems that you have to overcome in order to

122
00:06:21.575 --> 00:06:23.654
deal with ancient civilizations.

123
00:06:24.730 --> 00:06:27.459
So this is a point that you've already touched

124
00:06:27.459 --> 00:06:30.100
on very briefly, but in the book at a

125
00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:34.980
certain point you argue about how ancient history constitutes

126
00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:38.660
a foundational phase of human development in which the

127
00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:42.700
earliest versions of our current lifeways were created. I

128
00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:46.820
mean, what aspects of our lifeways, institutions, and the

129
00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:52.119
ways our societies are structured have originated in ancient

130
00:06:52.119 --> 00:06:52.299
history?

131
00:06:53.140 --> 00:06:55.059
Uh, THE short answer would be pretty much everything

132
00:06:55.059 --> 00:06:57.859
that you can think of. Uh, BEFORE the end

133
00:06:57.859 --> 00:07:01.149
of the last ice age, before the Holocene. Many,

134
00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:03.279
many things that we take for granted did not

135
00:07:03.279 --> 00:07:05.839
exist, and they only come into existence. I paint

136
00:07:05.839 --> 00:07:07.320
them with a broad brush here, but they come

137
00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:10.200
into existence only over the last 10,000 years or

138
00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:13.399
so. Food production, which we all rely on domestication

139
00:07:13.399 --> 00:07:19.950
of crops, domestication of animals, pastoralism, metallurgy, mining, uh,

140
00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:25.720
any number of basic technologies, physical technologies. Physical infrastructure,

141
00:07:25.799 --> 00:07:28.010
the fact that we live in houses, right, and

142
00:07:28.010 --> 00:07:30.630
we have windows and staircases and any number of

143
00:07:30.630 --> 00:07:34.799
gadgets, all these things don't exist, remarkably, uh, prior

144
00:07:34.799 --> 00:07:37.480
to that date. Um, I, I could give you

145
00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:38.720
a really long list, but I'm not going to

146
00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:40.540
give you a long list. You just look around

147
00:07:40.540 --> 00:07:42.980
you, and pretty much everything we use is some

148
00:07:42.980 --> 00:07:46.320
upgraded version of something that was originally invented back

149
00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:48.239
then, not the computers we currently use. It's a

150
00:07:48.239 --> 00:07:50.690
bit of an exception. But even the basic materials

151
00:07:50.690 --> 00:07:55.130
other than plastic are, you know, already rooted in

152
00:07:55.130 --> 00:07:58.329
that very early period. There are social technologies, government,

153
00:07:58.470 --> 00:08:04.010
taxation, organized warfare, jobs, all these things that really

154
00:08:04.010 --> 00:08:08.049
define our existence. Formal education, all these various things

155
00:08:08.049 --> 00:08:11.529
did not exist before that, schooling, you name it,

156
00:08:11.690 --> 00:08:14.453
prisons. Pretty much the same thing, uh, and of

157
00:08:14.453 --> 00:08:17.532
course literacy, the ability to write things down that

158
00:08:17.532 --> 00:08:20.243
comes relatively late in the process. It's not ubiquitous,

159
00:08:20.532 --> 00:08:22.523
but it's important, it's an important stage in that

160
00:08:22.523 --> 00:08:25.412
development. And last but not least, the major world

161
00:08:25.412 --> 00:08:28.532
religions that people still adhere to in their billions

162
00:08:28.532 --> 00:08:32.293
today come out of that period, again, the later

163
00:08:32.293 --> 00:08:35.695
stages of that particular phase, but it's certainly True,

164
00:08:35.736 --> 00:08:38.495
it's true of the Judeo-Christian Islamic tradition. It's true

165
00:08:38.495 --> 00:08:42.616
of Hinduism, of Buddhism, of Confucianism. All the major

166
00:08:42.616 --> 00:08:45.815
belief systems, Zoroastrianism, they all come out of that

167
00:08:45.815 --> 00:08:48.616
particular phase of development. You take all these things

168
00:08:48.616 --> 00:08:52.736
together, cumulatively, they define the way we live. We

169
00:08:52.736 --> 00:08:55.375
just use more of these things, upgraded versions of

170
00:08:55.375 --> 00:08:57.875
these things, but they are ultimately the same things.

171
00:08:58.929 --> 00:09:02.659
When it comes specifically to the development of writing,

172
00:09:02.900 --> 00:09:06.419
how important was it and did it change the

173
00:09:06.419 --> 00:09:08.640
way we approach human history?

174
00:09:09.140 --> 00:09:11.859
It was important at the time, even though very

175
00:09:11.859 --> 00:09:15.099
few people could generally read and write. It enables

176
00:09:15.099 --> 00:09:18.859
certain things like larger scale government administration, keeping track

177
00:09:18.859 --> 00:09:22.650
of things. It enables the creation of literary canons

178
00:09:22.650 --> 00:09:25.460
so you can write down oral traditions and create

179
00:09:25.460 --> 00:09:29.219
new genres like historiography and drama and all these

180
00:09:29.219 --> 00:09:32.179
various things that writing is very useful for. But

181
00:09:32.179 --> 00:09:33.869
you could even make a case that it's even

182
00:09:33.869 --> 00:09:37.030
more important for us as historians studying the past

183
00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:41.200
because historians have long distinguished between societies with writing.

184
00:09:41.859 --> 00:09:45.580
That have a proper history, quote unquote, and his,

185
00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:48.940
his Arab societies without writing that they usually consigned

186
00:09:48.940 --> 00:09:52.059
to some kind of prehistory, but they don't, they're

187
00:09:52.059 --> 00:09:54.539
not prehistoric. It just means we can't read their

188
00:09:54.539 --> 00:09:57.900
histories. It doesn't make them structurally different. It just,

189
00:09:57.979 --> 00:10:00.570
it just makes them different to us, the way

190
00:10:00.570 --> 00:10:02.659
we look at them and approach them. And it's

191
00:10:02.659 --> 00:10:04.919
one of the most unhelpful divisions in a way,

192
00:10:05.020 --> 00:10:06.479
in the study of the past.

193
00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.380
So this is a point that you also alluded

194
00:10:10.380 --> 00:10:13.919
to earlier. When it comes to the developments you

195
00:10:13.919 --> 00:10:17.919
enumerated, you argue in the book that they were

196
00:10:17.919 --> 00:10:21.880
not synchronized and started at different times and unfolded

197
00:10:21.880 --> 00:10:24.830
at different speeds in different parts of the world.

198
00:10:25.150 --> 00:10:27.880
Why is that important to keep in mind?

199
00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:29.760
It's important to keep in mind because of course

200
00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:31.880
the world was not globalized, integrated the way it

201
00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:33.640
is now. People had no idea what people were

202
00:10:33.640 --> 00:10:36.780
doing in other parts of the world. Um, CONNECTIONS

203
00:10:36.780 --> 00:10:39.419
had to be built up very, very gradually. It's

204
00:10:39.419 --> 00:10:42.340
important because it means that we can't define ancient

205
00:10:42.340 --> 00:10:44.739
history as a single period. That starts, you look

206
00:10:44.739 --> 00:10:48.260
at Wikipedia, ancient history starts in 3000 BC because

207
00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:50.780
in 3000 BC, the earliest forms of writing appeared

208
00:10:50.780 --> 00:10:53.739
in Egypt and Mesopotamia. That's not very interesting for

209
00:10:53.739 --> 00:10:56.859
people in China or Mexico or Central Africa, right,

210
00:10:57.059 --> 00:10:59.880
because they had no idea this was happening. So,

211
00:11:00.099 --> 00:11:02.070
we have to bear in mind that because of

212
00:11:02.070 --> 00:11:06.989
ecological differences, for the most part, development happens um

213
00:11:06.989 --> 00:11:09.469
at different times, at different speeds in different parts

214
00:11:09.469 --> 00:11:13.390
of the world. Sometimes these developments, these innovations kick

215
00:11:13.390 --> 00:11:15.549
in very early, like in West Asia, and then

216
00:11:15.549 --> 00:11:18.270
in East Asia. Sometimes it takes longer, like in

217
00:11:18.270 --> 00:11:21.979
Mesoamerica or in Peru or in sub-Saharan Africa, and

218
00:11:21.979 --> 00:11:24.799
sometimes they never happen, like in Australia. FOR instance,

219
00:11:24.849 --> 00:11:27.609
or in the Arctic, and there are ecological reasons

220
00:11:27.609 --> 00:11:32.090
for that, but that shouldn't lead us to exclude

221
00:11:32.090 --> 00:11:33.849
certain parts of the world from the study of

222
00:11:33.849 --> 00:11:36.719
ancient history. We just have to be flexible. We

223
00:11:36.719 --> 00:11:40.049
have to study the different ancient histories of those

224
00:11:40.049 --> 00:11:42.770
different parts of the world on their own terms

225
00:11:42.770 --> 00:11:45.770
as part of a larger whole, because if you,

226
00:11:45.929 --> 00:11:47.690
if you take enough steps back, you look at

227
00:11:47.690 --> 00:11:50.479
this. Um, IN, in, in, in, in the long

228
00:11:50.479 --> 00:11:53.549
run of history, you realize there are many similarities

229
00:11:53.690 --> 00:11:57.950
that people independently came up with similar solutions, totally

230
00:11:57.950 --> 00:12:00.130
independently in the case of the Americas. There's no

231
00:12:00.130 --> 00:12:02.530
contact between the Americas and the old world before

232
00:12:02.530 --> 00:12:04.690
the Europeans, before the Vikings show up. That's a

233
00:12:04.690 --> 00:12:07.640
very small kind of contact. So basically there's no

234
00:12:07.640 --> 00:12:09.950
contact and yet you have very similar developments in

235
00:12:09.950 --> 00:12:13.270
Mesoamerica, in the Andes, going back thousands of years,

236
00:12:13.520 --> 00:12:16.159
the same way you have in Eurasia or in

237
00:12:16.159 --> 00:12:18.359
parts of Africa. We have to bear that in

238
00:12:18.359 --> 00:12:20.080
mind. If we don't bear this in mind, we'll

239
00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:22.960
never understand that ancient history was a global phenomenon.

240
00:12:23.830 --> 00:12:26.229
And do we have a good understanding as to

241
00:12:26.229 --> 00:12:31.789
why similar developments occurred in places around the world,

242
00:12:32.150 --> 00:12:37.090
particularly as you mentioned, the Americas and Afro-Eurasia, er,

243
00:12:37.450 --> 00:12:41.510
in a completely independent manner. I mean, how was

244
00:12:41.510 --> 00:12:42.309
it possible?

245
00:12:42.950 --> 00:12:44.830
Well, let me give you a provocative answer to

246
00:12:44.830 --> 00:12:48.869
that question. If we had already structured ancient history

247
00:12:48.869 --> 00:12:50.950
in a global way, we would be in a

248
00:12:50.950 --> 00:12:54.250
much better position to answer that question, right? Because

249
00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:56.270
you have to study different parts of the world

250
00:12:56.270 --> 00:13:02.000
side by side, systematically, comparatively. To identify certain variables,

251
00:13:02.119 --> 00:13:05.989
certain factors, certain features that will produce certain outcomes,

252
00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:09.820
we are still very much at the beginning because

253
00:13:09.830 --> 00:13:12.919
by focusing on individual parts of the world, we

254
00:13:12.919 --> 00:13:15.559
are not really well equipped to address this question

255
00:13:15.559 --> 00:13:19.099
in a very satisfactory way. The provisional answer is

256
00:13:19.099 --> 00:13:23.020
it's ultimately the environment, it's ecology. People used to

257
00:13:23.020 --> 00:13:25.859
think it's racial characteristics that people are not all

258
00:13:25.859 --> 00:13:28.340
the same. That's rubbish. As far as we can

259
00:13:28.340 --> 00:13:30.460
tell, it's about the environment. People all come out

260
00:13:30.460 --> 00:13:32.299
of Africa. They settle in different parts of the

261
00:13:32.299 --> 00:13:36.219
globe. They encounter very different conditions, and those conditions

262
00:13:36.219 --> 00:13:39.099
inevitably shape what they're able to do, what the

263
00:13:39.099 --> 00:13:42.179
incentives are, the disincentives, and so on. And that

264
00:13:42.179 --> 00:13:44.619
seems to account for much of the variation that

265
00:13:44.619 --> 00:13:47.010
happens. There may be other factors too. But as

266
00:13:47.010 --> 00:13:49.489
I said, we are in a sense still very

267
00:13:49.489 --> 00:13:53.010
much at the beginning of really properly investigating this

268
00:13:53.010 --> 00:13:55.130
question. In order to really figure it out, we

269
00:13:55.130 --> 00:13:58.190
need a fully globalized comparative ancient history.

270
00:13:59.369 --> 00:14:03.580
And these developments that occurred across the world uh

271
00:14:03.580 --> 00:14:08.690
crowded out alternative arrangements, right, because things could have

272
00:14:08.690 --> 00:14:10.289
developed differently.

273
00:14:10.780 --> 00:14:12.750
That's very true. Once you have food production, you

274
00:14:12.750 --> 00:14:15.789
have higher population densities. As a result, you have

275
00:14:15.789 --> 00:14:18.099
states, you have cities, you have large armies, you

276
00:14:18.099 --> 00:14:20.669
have capabilities, you have a class structure, you have

277
00:14:20.669 --> 00:14:23.229
oppression, you have inequality, you have slavery. You have

278
00:14:23.229 --> 00:14:26.429
all these terrible things that make these societies very

279
00:14:26.429 --> 00:14:29.750
competitive, and we can see historically how these very

280
00:14:29.750 --> 00:14:34.750
competitive societies absorb others or destroy them or, you

281
00:14:34.750 --> 00:14:37.710
know, subjugate them as European colonizers. WOULD do later

282
00:14:37.710 --> 00:14:42.270
on. Those are almost inevitable outcomes. Once these bundles

283
00:14:42.270 --> 00:14:44.900
of features are in place thousands of years ago,

284
00:14:45.109 --> 00:14:47.349
it was just a matter of time till they

285
00:14:47.349 --> 00:14:51.190
would spread and expand and eventually encompass the entire

286
00:14:51.190 --> 00:14:54.169
planet, and that certainly happened. That has certainly happened.

287
00:14:54.390 --> 00:14:57.630
And in so doing, they have really trapped us

288
00:14:57.630 --> 00:15:00.590
in one particular way of life, so to speak.

289
00:15:00.679 --> 00:15:02.989
There are still significant cultural differences between different parts

290
00:15:02.989 --> 00:15:05.789
of the. WORLD, of course. But ultimately, we all

291
00:15:05.789 --> 00:15:09.190
tend to do things a certain way, uh, so

292
00:15:09.190 --> 00:15:11.989
to speak, when it is perfectly possible that many

293
00:15:11.989 --> 00:15:15.460
thousands of years ago, foragers, hunter-gatherers would do things

294
00:15:15.460 --> 00:15:18.530
differently, in meaningfully different ways, that's just no longer

295
00:15:18.530 --> 00:15:21.750
feasible, right? Everything has been taken over by the

296
00:15:21.750 --> 00:15:25.150
most competitive and in a way, most dominant and

297
00:15:25.150 --> 00:15:28.929
sometimes most violent societies that this process has produced.

298
00:15:30.190 --> 00:15:33.479
In the book you also talk about and critique

299
00:15:33.479 --> 00:15:38.119
in a way the way academics have approached ancient

300
00:15:38.119 --> 00:15:39.919
history, and I even have a quote here. You

301
00:15:39.919 --> 00:15:45.559
talk about the intensely fragmented ethnocentric and parochial manner

302
00:15:45.559 --> 00:15:48.960
in which it is routinely perceived, studied, and taught.

303
00:15:49.090 --> 00:15:51.789
So, uh, could you tell us more about that?

304
00:15:51.880 --> 00:15:55.400
How have academics approached ancient history?

305
00:15:55.909 --> 00:15:57.830
I think a big part of the problem, problem

306
00:15:57.830 --> 00:16:00.510
of the, of the history of scholarship is, of

307
00:16:00.510 --> 00:16:03.510
course, increasing specialization. You go back a few 100

308
00:16:03.510 --> 00:16:06.390
years, people were polymaths, right? They would do a

309
00:16:06.390 --> 00:16:09.349
number of different things, usually poorly. They knew a

310
00:16:09.349 --> 00:16:12.109
little about lots of things. And we have now

311
00:16:12.109 --> 00:16:14.914
ended up in a situation. But most people know

312
00:16:14.914 --> 00:16:17.434
very much about very little, so to speak. They

313
00:16:17.434 --> 00:16:20.674
become specialists because that's how you create new knowledge

314
00:16:20.674 --> 00:16:22.905
or that's the approved way of creating new knowledge.

315
00:16:23.114 --> 00:16:26.645
That's how the whole uh uh uh academic structure

316
00:16:26.645 --> 00:16:29.994
works, the training, the incentive structures, promotion, hiring, you

317
00:16:29.994 --> 00:16:34.955
name it, right? Um, SO that is inevitable. It

318
00:16:34.955 --> 00:16:38.155
has produced an enormous increase in knowledge and understanding,

319
00:16:38.234 --> 00:16:40.849
so it was a good thing. But as always,

320
00:16:40.859 --> 00:16:43.289
there's a trade-off. You have more of a good

321
00:16:43.289 --> 00:16:44.809
thing, you get more of a bad thing at

322
00:16:44.809 --> 00:16:48.200
the same time, and the bad thing is hyperspecialization.

323
00:16:48.489 --> 00:16:51.890
We find it more difficult to make connections. We,

324
00:16:52.130 --> 00:16:53.849
we find it more difficult to make connections to

325
00:16:53.849 --> 00:16:57.159
other disciplines. And in the case of early history,

326
00:16:57.409 --> 00:16:59.530
we find it much more difficult to make connections

327
00:16:59.530 --> 00:17:02.429
to other parts of the world that are early

328
00:17:02.570 --> 00:17:05.430
or ancient. And so we don't talk to people

329
00:17:05.560 --> 00:17:08.900
who study. Very similar things in different parts of

330
00:17:08.900 --> 00:17:11.819
the world, even though if we did, we'd be

331
00:17:11.819 --> 00:17:14.630
better off. We just don't have time to do

332
00:17:14.630 --> 00:17:16.858
it or we are not motivated to do it,

333
00:17:16.868 --> 00:17:19.530
or there are disincentives to doing it because we're

334
00:17:19.530 --> 00:17:23.108
rewarded for being specialists. That's the very short answer

335
00:17:23.108 --> 00:17:25.280
in a nutshell. And so what you end up

336
00:17:25.280 --> 00:17:28.400
with is a de facto fragmentation of the world

337
00:17:28.400 --> 00:17:32.349
that is being studied into little bits and pieces.

338
00:17:32.810 --> 00:17:35.430
Where some people study the Roman Republic and other

339
00:17:35.430 --> 00:17:37.849
people studied the early Roman Empire and the late

340
00:17:37.849 --> 00:17:40.810
Roman Empire, and the post-Roman societies, and the Greeks

341
00:17:40.810 --> 00:17:42.410
before Rome and the Greeks under Rome, and the

342
00:17:42.410 --> 00:17:44.930
Greeks after Rome and Byzantium. And then there are

343
00:17:44.930 --> 00:17:47.930
50 other areas of specialization where people study, I

344
00:17:47.930 --> 00:17:51.130
don't know, early Japan or the Olmecs, uh, in,

345
00:17:51.209 --> 00:17:53.849
in Mexico or what, or Zimbabwe or what have

346
00:17:53.849 --> 00:17:56.849
you, right? And they're all specialists, and there's very

347
00:17:56.849 --> 00:17:58.650
little if any communication between them.

348
00:17:59.869 --> 00:18:03.040
And this specialization you referred to goes back to

349
00:18:03.040 --> 00:18:06.800
the 19th century, right? It was then that the

350
00:18:06.800 --> 00:18:09.839
sort of dismembering of ancient history started.

351
00:18:10.319 --> 00:18:12.310
Yes, I mean, many fields are being dismembered in

352
00:18:12.310 --> 00:18:15.790
that period, but for ancient history, uh, it's particularly

353
00:18:15.790 --> 00:18:18.959
visible because, as I said, it was, um, it

354
00:18:18.959 --> 00:18:22.280
was, um, joined with at the very least the

355
00:18:22.280 --> 00:18:24.780
study of what we call the ancient Near East

356
00:18:24.920 --> 00:18:26.560
or West Asia. The people call it the Old

357
00:18:26.560 --> 00:18:30.400
Testament tradition, Egypt, Carthage, and so on. And even

358
00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:34.329
those neighbors get are pushed away or consigned to

359
00:18:34.329 --> 00:18:37.729
their own many disciplines, whereas a lot of prestige

360
00:18:37.729 --> 00:18:41.010
and resources are allocated to the study of Greece

361
00:18:41.010 --> 00:18:44.030
and Roman, especially Greeks, because the Greeks are seen

362
00:18:44.449 --> 00:18:47.130
as the originators and the Romans in a way

363
00:18:47.130 --> 00:18:50.630
are already sort of second rank, they're inheritors of

364
00:18:50.630 --> 00:18:52.949
all the wonderful things the Greeks came up with.

365
00:18:53.859 --> 00:18:57.459
But when it comes to specialization and its drawbacks,

366
00:18:57.579 --> 00:18:59.619
do you think it's possible for us to do

367
00:18:59.619 --> 00:19:02.699
it any other way? I mean, with the vast

368
00:19:02.699 --> 00:19:06.780
amount of knowledge that we have accumulated even in

369
00:19:06.780 --> 00:19:10.900
specialized areas of history, is it possible for people

370
00:19:10.900 --> 00:19:13.280
to be more generalists?

371
00:19:13.819 --> 00:19:16.140
Well, people to some extent have to be experts

372
00:19:16.140 --> 00:19:19.280
on something. I think that's inevitable. But they also

373
00:19:19.280 --> 00:19:21.920
need to collaborate, and we have a great model

374
00:19:21.920 --> 00:19:24.520
which is archaeology. You can't go out as a

375
00:19:24.520 --> 00:19:26.640
single person and do an excavation. I mean, you

376
00:19:26.640 --> 00:19:29.060
could, but you wouldn't get very far. You need

377
00:19:29.060 --> 00:19:32.520
people who have expertise in different areas. They have

378
00:19:32.520 --> 00:19:34.959
to come together and they have to work together

379
00:19:34.959 --> 00:19:37.880
to make this happen. And historians very rarely do

380
00:19:37.880 --> 00:19:41.040
this. They don't get together with historians of similar

381
00:19:41.040 --> 00:19:43.709
kinds of societies. Uh, EVEN though they could learn

382
00:19:43.709 --> 00:19:45.869
a lot from doing this, they rarely get together

383
00:19:45.869 --> 00:19:48.430
with them in research or in teaching, and that

384
00:19:48.430 --> 00:19:50.670
would be a model, a model that already exists.

385
00:19:50.920 --> 00:19:52.790
We all have to be experts, but we need

386
00:19:52.790 --> 00:19:55.790
to be experts who are not only aware of

387
00:19:55.790 --> 00:19:57.579
the fact that there are other experts out there,

388
00:19:57.780 --> 00:20:00.109
we have to be willing and motivated to go

389
00:20:00.109 --> 00:20:02.989
and actually work with them to create new kinds

390
00:20:02.989 --> 00:20:03.849
of knowledge.

391
00:20:05.180 --> 00:20:07.209
So I would like to go back for a

392
00:20:07.209 --> 00:20:11.619
second to the focus on Greece and Rome specifically.

393
00:20:12.250 --> 00:20:16.770
How has it developed and why this obsession with

394
00:20:16.770 --> 00:20:18.869
so-called Western civilization?

395
00:20:19.819 --> 00:20:21.930
As I said, to some part it's, it's specialization,

396
00:20:22.069 --> 00:20:24.550
but there's another, uh, dimension to it. And the

397
00:20:24.550 --> 00:20:28.150
dimension has to do with valuation that people starting

398
00:20:28.150 --> 00:20:31.670
in the late 18th century in Western Europe, um,

399
00:20:32.109 --> 00:20:34.150
got a very high opinion of themselves because they

400
00:20:34.150 --> 00:20:37.380
were unbelievably successful. They were going out, colonizing other

401
00:20:37.380 --> 00:20:40.349
parts of the globe, dominating others, even the great

402
00:20:40.349 --> 00:20:42.790
civilizations of China, India, the Middle East, and so

403
00:20:42.790 --> 00:20:45.119
on. So they figured, well, we must be very

404
00:20:45.119 --> 00:20:47.800
special people, and we are very special people for

405
00:20:47.800 --> 00:20:50.790
a number of reasons. It used to be Christianity,

406
00:20:51.160 --> 00:20:54.040
but with secularization it becomes a little less popular

407
00:20:54.040 --> 00:20:56.760
as an argument. You see the rise of scientific

408
00:20:56.760 --> 00:20:59.920
racism, saying white people are just better than other

409
00:20:59.920 --> 00:21:02.109
people, and that's why we are more successful. And

410
00:21:02.109 --> 00:21:05.109
then you get the cultural approach saying, well, it's

411
00:21:05.109 --> 00:21:08.079
really about our cultural lineage. It's because we have

412
00:21:08.079 --> 00:21:10.750
inherited the wisdom of the Greeks and the Romans,

413
00:21:10.800 --> 00:21:13.650
and that makes us more capable. And now it's

414
00:21:13.650 --> 00:21:17.290
our duty to really take good care of that

415
00:21:17.290 --> 00:21:21.130
inheritance, of that legacy, and study them in even

416
00:21:21.130 --> 00:21:24.209
greater detail in a more professional way. And it's

417
00:21:24.209 --> 00:21:26.410
also seen at the same time, this may seem

418
00:21:26.410 --> 00:21:31.180
a bit paradoxical as a counterweight to modernization. That

419
00:21:31.180 --> 00:21:34.050
people about the Romantics in particular, were disenchanted with

420
00:21:34.050 --> 00:21:38.540
modernization. They would see it as soulless, the takeover

421
00:21:38.540 --> 00:21:42.079
of industry, of commerce, of rationalism, of all these

422
00:21:42.260 --> 00:21:45.140
things that worked really well, but they left something

423
00:21:45.140 --> 00:21:47.780
to be desired. And the idea was if we

424
00:21:47.780 --> 00:21:50.680
go back to the source, the Greeks in particular,

425
00:21:50.819 --> 00:21:54.160
who are really pure, they are authentic, they're original,

426
00:21:54.459 --> 00:21:57.699
they are a fountain of original insight and wisdom

427
00:21:57.699 --> 00:22:00.900
and beauty. Uh, IF we go and we commune

428
00:22:00.900 --> 00:22:05.140
with them very intimately, it will improve us as

429
00:22:05.140 --> 00:22:08.540
people, and it will enable us to deal better

430
00:22:08.540 --> 00:22:11.800
with the disadvantages of modernization. But we have to

431
00:22:11.800 --> 00:22:15.599
do this not as amateurs, which people have done

432
00:22:15.599 --> 00:22:17.359
for a long time. We have to do it

433
00:22:17.359 --> 00:22:20.390
as professionals, as scholars. We have to know their

434
00:22:20.390 --> 00:22:23.189
language really, really well. We have to know their

435
00:22:23.189 --> 00:22:26.880
material culturally well, their art, their philosophy, everything that

436
00:22:26.880 --> 00:22:30.109
they produced is worthy of study because that's the

437
00:22:30.109 --> 00:22:33.359
only way we can actually commune with them, establish

438
00:22:33.359 --> 00:22:36.199
this kind of special relationship that we have anyway,

439
00:22:36.400 --> 00:22:38.280
but we have to bring it to full fruition.

440
00:22:38.680 --> 00:22:40.609
And as a result, we need to teach more

441
00:22:40.609 --> 00:22:43.280
Greek and Latin in school, in high school, at

442
00:22:43.280 --> 00:22:46.650
university. It has to be an important part of

443
00:22:46.650 --> 00:22:50.569
educating the bourgeoisie, uh, making sure there's a standard

444
00:22:50.569 --> 00:22:53.319
that people have to adhere to to prove they

445
00:22:53.319 --> 00:22:57.410
are worthy of admission to privileged, um, society, get

446
00:22:57.410 --> 00:22:59.689
a certain kind of jobs, uh, and so on.

447
00:22:59.739 --> 00:23:04.295
So it's a huge package of. Cultural prestige, romantic

448
00:23:04.295 --> 00:23:10.035
yearning, scholarly professionalization all packaged together in a way

449
00:23:10.035 --> 00:23:14.334
that creates a very, very strong emphasis on the

450
00:23:14.334 --> 00:23:18.694
Greeks and Romans in education and in the public

451
00:23:18.694 --> 00:23:21.494
arena in that period, which you see reflected in

452
00:23:21.494 --> 00:23:24.814
literature, in architecture, in any number of domains.

453
00:23:25.910 --> 00:23:29.670
And people study what is known as the classics,

454
00:23:29.750 --> 00:23:33.770
the Greek and Roman classics. How were they established?

455
00:23:34.189 --> 00:23:36.670
The classics are interesting. They actually really come in

456
00:23:36.670 --> 00:23:38.709
a sense out of Germany, the idea of Alter

457
00:23:38.709 --> 00:23:41.829
tombs Wiesssenschaft, that there would be a science of

458
00:23:41.829 --> 00:23:44.709
antiquity, because up to that point people focused very

459
00:23:44.709 --> 00:23:47.030
much on language. The idea was you had to

460
00:23:47.030 --> 00:23:49.630
learn a language well enough to imitate Cicero, other

461
00:23:49.630 --> 00:23:52.760
ancient authors, and write like the Romans. Um, AND

462
00:23:52.760 --> 00:23:54.400
that worked well for a really long time, and

463
00:23:54.400 --> 00:23:56.560
you had to understand Greek for the New Testament,

464
00:23:56.579 --> 00:23:58.760
and you had to understand Latin for Roman law

465
00:23:58.760 --> 00:24:00.920
and all these various things. But then the idea

466
00:24:00.920 --> 00:24:03.319
was, no, we have to be holistic. You can't

467
00:24:03.319 --> 00:24:06.510
just focus on language and certain kinds of texts.

468
00:24:06.760 --> 00:24:10.619
We have to understand, uh, Greece and Rome as,

469
00:24:10.680 --> 00:24:13.199
uh, um, um, in, in, in, in their, in,

470
00:24:13.310 --> 00:24:16.542
in their full. Capacity in all the different aspects

471
00:24:16.542 --> 00:24:19.512
and dimensions, so we need to create an academic

472
00:24:19.512 --> 00:24:23.192
field that looks at everything those people produced and

473
00:24:23.192 --> 00:24:27.392
it has been passed on to us. Language, literature,

474
00:24:27.873 --> 00:24:32.192
history, philosophy, art, any number of things. Anything you

475
00:24:32.192 --> 00:24:35.373
can think of is part of the same field.

476
00:24:35.546 --> 00:24:38.765
And that would then be called our classics eventually.

477
00:24:38.826 --> 00:24:40.806
It takes a while in the Anglo world to

478
00:24:40.806 --> 00:24:44.145
late 19th century for all these other elements to

479
00:24:44.145 --> 00:24:46.946
be fully incorporated alongside the study of language and

480
00:24:46.946 --> 00:24:49.926
literature, but eventually you end up with a field

481
00:24:50.066 --> 00:24:53.586
that is holistic, that says we study everything about

482
00:24:53.586 --> 00:24:56.505
the Greeks and Romans, and we call it the

483
00:24:56.515 --> 00:24:57.145
classics.

484
00:24:58.510 --> 00:25:02.989
Are other ancient cultures covered in universities and if

485
00:25:02.989 --> 00:25:06.550
so in what kinds of departments and programs?

486
00:25:07.530 --> 00:25:10.319
They are covered to a lesser extent because of,

487
00:25:10.609 --> 00:25:12.260
well, the, the, the Greeks and Romans had a

488
00:25:12.260 --> 00:25:15.010
head start, so they were privileged, privileged from the

489
00:25:15.010 --> 00:25:19.369
beginning. There's less funding. They are covered, often in

490
00:25:19.369 --> 00:25:22.969
very tiny programs that may be freestanding in some

491
00:25:22.969 --> 00:25:27.949
cases, consolidated into larger schools. In other cases, Egyptologists

492
00:25:27.949 --> 00:25:32.790
who only study pharaonic Egypt, Assyriologists who study Mesopotamia,

493
00:25:33.250 --> 00:25:37.709
Judaists to study early Hebrew culture, um, people who

494
00:25:37.709 --> 00:25:40.969
Iranian studies, people who just study Iran and Central

495
00:25:40.969 --> 00:25:46.349
Asia. Uh, SINOLOGISTS who study early China, Sanskrit scholars

496
00:25:46.349 --> 00:25:49.050
who studied the literary tradition of early, um, India.

497
00:25:49.670 --> 00:25:52.310
There are experts in the archaeology and, and the

498
00:25:52.310 --> 00:25:55.750
many different languages of Central, um, Asia, Central Eurasia,

499
00:25:55.829 --> 00:25:59.010
the Steppe, uh, peoples who are increasingly well understood.

500
00:25:59.359 --> 00:26:02.589
Uh, THERE are people in anthropology departments who study

501
00:26:02.589 --> 00:26:05.030
the Olmecs and the Maya and the Aztecs and

502
00:26:05.030 --> 00:26:07.550
the, the, uh, the Inca and, and all these

503
00:26:07.550 --> 00:26:11.780
various civilizations in the Americas. Or, uh, uh, Kahokia

504
00:26:11.780 --> 00:26:15.109
in the United States. Um, THERE are even fewer

505
00:26:15.109 --> 00:26:17.660
people who try to study early cultures in sub-Saharan

506
00:26:17.660 --> 00:26:21.349
Africa, but they all operate in different environments, in

507
00:26:21.349 --> 00:26:24.780
different academic units, and they have little, if any,

508
00:26:24.790 --> 00:26:29.040
contact with one another. And there are far fewer

509
00:26:29.040 --> 00:26:30.880
people who do this, uh, than there are people

510
00:26:30.880 --> 00:26:32.699
who studied Greece and Rome, that's fair to say.

511
00:26:33.489 --> 00:26:36.300
OK, and do you think that that fact that

512
00:26:36.300 --> 00:26:39.739
they operate in different units is problematic, and if

513
00:26:39.739 --> 00:26:42.660
so, what can be done to correct this state

514
00:26:42.660 --> 00:26:43.739
of affairs?

515
00:26:44.099 --> 00:26:46.020
It is, I mean, it's as I said, it's

516
00:26:46.020 --> 00:26:48.219
necessary to have expertise, but it doesn't mean you

517
00:26:48.219 --> 00:26:49.890
have to be in your own mini unit. It

518
00:26:49.890 --> 00:26:52.699
would make more sense to be embedded, and history

519
00:26:52.699 --> 00:26:54.420
is a good example. You can be a historian

520
00:26:54.420 --> 00:26:56.290
of the Middle Ages, and you can be a

521
00:26:56.290 --> 00:26:59.939
historian of, uh, I don't know, um, the Iraq

522
00:26:59.939 --> 00:27:02.189
War, and it would be in the same department,

523
00:27:02.339 --> 00:27:04.270
and you would be next door to the person,

524
00:27:04.339 --> 00:27:06.420
you know, studying the Middle Ages, and at least

525
00:27:06.420 --> 00:27:08.459
there would be some communication, at least you would

526
00:27:08.459 --> 00:27:10.724
hope. That's not usually the. Case with people who

527
00:27:10.724 --> 00:27:14.244
study these various ancient societies, so it would make

528
00:27:14.244 --> 00:27:17.635
sense to bring them together at least organizationally, um,

529
00:27:17.685 --> 00:27:20.525
encourage broader teaching. It will also be of interest

530
00:27:20.525 --> 00:27:23.625
to students, right? To be introduced to multiple societies,

531
00:27:23.844 --> 00:27:26.444
um, at the same time in, in a user-friendly

532
00:27:26.444 --> 00:27:29.564
way. Um, ALL these things could easily, uh, be

533
00:27:29.564 --> 00:27:31.744
done. And now I've sort of forgot the original

534
00:27:31.744 --> 00:27:34.244
question because that wasn't quite the question I was

535
00:27:34.244 --> 00:27:34.905
answering.

536
00:27:36.689 --> 00:27:40.170
No, I, I was asking you if there's something

537
00:27:40.170 --> 00:27:42.290
that can be done to correct this state of

538
00:27:42.290 --> 00:27:46.810
affairs of people that study different civilizations and cultures

539
00:27:46.810 --> 00:27:49.209
operating in different units. Yeah, I

540
00:27:49.209 --> 00:27:51.400
mean, I think what I just said really applies

541
00:27:51.400 --> 00:27:52.760
to this because, like I said, there will always

542
00:27:52.760 --> 00:27:55.050
be experts who always have to specialize in something

543
00:27:55.050 --> 00:27:57.339
to some extent. But there should be way more

544
00:27:57.339 --> 00:28:01.609
collaboration, uh, and that can be brought about by

545
00:28:01.609 --> 00:28:04.589
organizational, um, reorganization, uh, in a way which is

546
00:28:04.589 --> 00:28:07.469
happening anyway. It's usually happening for the wrong reasons,

547
00:28:07.510 --> 00:28:10.750
like funding constraints, where you say, instead of having

548
00:28:10.750 --> 00:28:12.699
5 small departments, we put them all together in

549
00:28:12.699 --> 00:28:14.989
one big department and we reduce overhead and we

550
00:28:14.989 --> 00:28:17.810
save some money. That's not really the the the

551
00:28:17.810 --> 00:28:20.209
best reason for doing it, but at the end

552
00:28:20.209 --> 00:28:22.250
of the day, maybe that's the way it will

553
00:28:22.250 --> 00:28:24.010
have to be. It should be driven though by

554
00:28:24.010 --> 00:28:26.569
an intellectual agenda. It should be driven not by

555
00:28:26.569 --> 00:28:29.949
funding constraints. It should be driven by the realization

556
00:28:30.609 --> 00:28:34.030
that all these experts are studying very similar things

557
00:28:34.170 --> 00:28:37.209
and they would be better off if they were

558
00:28:37.209 --> 00:28:42.310
embedded in larger structures that bring them together and

559
00:28:42.310 --> 00:28:44.709
uh encourage more conversation among them.

560
00:28:45.930 --> 00:28:49.660
And what does ancient history mean in a world

561
00:28:49.660 --> 00:28:53.979
that is increasingly multiethnic and cosmopolitan?

562
00:28:55.380 --> 00:28:56.750
I of course have now lived in the US

563
00:28:56.750 --> 00:28:59.380
for 25 years. The question is what is ancient

564
00:28:59.380 --> 00:29:01.219
history in the US? Is it just the ancient

565
00:29:01.219 --> 00:29:03.180
history of the white settlers who came in from

566
00:29:03.180 --> 00:29:05.180
Europe? Is it the ancient history of the people

567
00:29:05.180 --> 00:29:08.040
from south of the border who descend from indigenous

568
00:29:08.459 --> 00:29:11.089
civilizations in Mexico and further south? Is it the

569
00:29:11.089 --> 00:29:12.819
ancient history of people who come in from East

570
00:29:12.819 --> 00:29:15.219
Asia or South Asia? Is it the early history

571
00:29:15.219 --> 00:29:17.250
of the indigenous people of North America who are

572
00:29:17.250 --> 00:29:19.579
of course still here in small numbers, but they

573
00:29:19.579 --> 00:29:22.390
are present? Well, it has to be a globalized

574
00:29:22.390 --> 00:29:25.040
ancient history. It makes no sense to say the

575
00:29:25.040 --> 00:29:26.869
Greeks and Romans are the ancient history of the

576
00:29:26.869 --> 00:29:30.510
US. That's just absurd. And even for Europe, there's

577
00:29:30.510 --> 00:29:34.500
a significant foreign born element, if you will, and

578
00:29:34.500 --> 00:29:38.069
all countries to varying extents are now globalized, right?

579
00:29:38.180 --> 00:29:41.270
They are incorporated into global structures. It means that

580
00:29:41.270 --> 00:29:44.369
the outlook of the distant past ought to be

581
00:29:44.550 --> 00:29:48.750
not just governed by narrowly nationalistic principles, it ought

582
00:29:48.750 --> 00:29:52.805
to be more cosmopolitan, you know. And more globalized.

583
00:29:52.885 --> 00:29:55.525
So I think, uh, for that reason alone, we

584
00:29:55.525 --> 00:29:58.324
need a more globalized ancient history, but for intellectual

585
00:29:58.324 --> 00:30:01.125
reasons because it makes the most sense. But also,

586
00:30:01.165 --> 00:30:03.604
if you will, for ethical reasons, for for reasons

587
00:30:03.604 --> 00:30:06.364
of equity, we can't just go on privileging one

588
00:30:06.364 --> 00:30:09.295
tiny sliver, very influential sliver, but still a tiny

589
00:30:09.295 --> 00:30:11.765
sliver of the ancient world at the expense of

590
00:30:11.765 --> 00:30:12.425
everybody else.

591
00:30:13.400 --> 00:30:18.719
And so is genuine ancient history, diverse and inclusive.

592
00:30:19.579 --> 00:30:21.780
If it was set up in this way, it

593
00:30:21.780 --> 00:30:25.739
would almost inevitably automatically become more diverse and inclusive.

594
00:30:26.060 --> 00:30:28.020
Of course we can't end up with a globalized

595
00:30:28.020 --> 00:30:31.260
ancient history that's some kind of ranking system. We

596
00:30:31.260 --> 00:30:33.359
just conclude that the Greeks and Romans are better

597
00:30:33.359 --> 00:30:35.300
than everybody else once we have compared them. That

598
00:30:35.300 --> 00:30:37.640
wouldn't be very helpful. And I don't think anybody

599
00:30:37.640 --> 00:30:41.170
wants that, but um we need to have arrived

600
00:30:41.170 --> 00:30:43.589
at a situation where we can bring the different

601
00:30:43.589 --> 00:30:47.719
specialisms in conversation with one another, and that would

602
00:30:47.719 --> 00:30:50.239
certainly not just create barriers to the creation of

603
00:30:50.239 --> 00:30:53.079
knowledge, it will also, I think, result in a

604
00:30:53.079 --> 00:30:56.035
better understanding of the The fact that very deep

605
00:30:56.035 --> 00:30:58.875
down people all over the world have more in

606
00:30:58.875 --> 00:31:01.915
common than what separates them, and that's not a

607
00:31:01.915 --> 00:31:05.314
recent phenomenon. It's not a result of homogenization, modernization.

608
00:31:05.395 --> 00:31:07.395
That's part of the story, but it's something that

609
00:31:07.395 --> 00:31:10.755
starts already many thousands of years ago in these

610
00:31:10.755 --> 00:31:12.994
independent developmental processes.

611
00:31:14.290 --> 00:31:18.099
And how can the global turn you talk about

612
00:31:18.099 --> 00:31:20.219
in the book be executed?

613
00:31:21.160 --> 00:31:25.239
It can be executed, I think, in terms of

614
00:31:25.239 --> 00:31:29.439
a number of things. One is revaluation. We have

615
00:31:29.439 --> 00:31:31.680
to in a way agree that this is worth

616
00:31:31.680 --> 00:31:33.599
doing. If we don't agree on this, there won't

617
00:31:33.599 --> 00:31:36.359
be any change, and I think the rationale for

618
00:31:36.359 --> 00:31:39.109
this is pretty strong. It's very difficult, I think,

619
00:31:39.160 --> 00:31:42.119
intellectually and ethically to say we should maintain the

620
00:31:42.119 --> 00:31:46.640
status quo. The second step would then be reconceptualization.

621
00:31:47.150 --> 00:31:50.699
How do we actually re-envision studying the ancient world?

622
00:31:50.989 --> 00:31:54.040
What are the boundaries? What is the relationship between

623
00:31:54.040 --> 00:31:57.949
expertise and broader engagement? A lot of thought is

624
00:31:57.949 --> 00:32:00.589
needed to do that. It hasn't been done yet

625
00:32:00.589 --> 00:32:02.310
because we're not there yet, but that's something that

626
00:32:02.310 --> 00:32:04.650
would need to happen. And the third step would

627
00:32:04.650 --> 00:32:08.410
then be reorganization. How do we reorganize the way

628
00:32:08.410 --> 00:32:12.410
we train people, we teach students in secondary schooling

629
00:32:12.410 --> 00:32:15.609
at universities? What's the best way of going about

630
00:32:15.609 --> 00:32:18.930
doing things? There's probably no one way. There would

631
00:32:18.930 --> 00:32:21.489
have to be experimentation, right? There might well be

632
00:32:21.489 --> 00:32:25.369
different ways of reorganizing um academia and see how

633
00:32:25.369 --> 00:32:28.530
they work out. This will take time. It will

634
00:32:28.530 --> 00:32:33.050
run into formidable obstacles like inertia. Academic inertia is

635
00:32:33.050 --> 00:32:37.130
extremely powerful, not to be underestimated, very closely related

636
00:32:37.130 --> 00:32:40.170
to bureaucratic inertia. There's often very little you can

637
00:32:40.170 --> 00:32:42.890
do about it, but it's worth at least starting

638
00:32:42.890 --> 00:32:47.989
the process through reevaluation and reconceptualization, which we can

639
00:32:47.989 --> 00:32:51.449
do even within the existing structures before the structures

640
00:32:51.449 --> 00:32:52.890
themselves get changed.

641
00:32:54.079 --> 00:32:57.780
Uh, WHAT do you make of cross-cultural scholarship and

642
00:32:57.780 --> 00:33:02.410
comparative approaches? Are they important in this turn you

643
00:33:02.410 --> 00:33:03.290
suggest in the book?

644
00:33:04.069 --> 00:33:06.800
I think they're extremely important. Of course, not everybody

645
00:33:06.800 --> 00:33:08.880
is going to become a comparative historian. It's not

646
00:33:08.880 --> 00:33:11.199
the goal, but at the very least, there needs

647
00:33:11.199 --> 00:33:15.390
to be some cross-cultural comparative awareness. My position is

648
00:33:15.390 --> 00:33:18.000
maybe a bit radical. It is that it's actually

649
00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:22.040
very difficult to fully understand any one case, any

650
00:33:22.040 --> 00:33:26.104
one society you study without knowing other societies. Societies

651
00:33:26.104 --> 00:33:28.765
as well, because you will never have a good

652
00:33:28.765 --> 00:33:31.685
idea of what really matters and what doesn't. You

653
00:33:31.685 --> 00:33:34.925
may be taken in by what is particularly well

654
00:33:34.925 --> 00:33:38.265
documented in a particular case or what scholarship on

655
00:33:38.265 --> 00:33:42.099
one particular case has tended to emphasize. And if

656
00:33:42.099 --> 00:33:43.540
you go out and you look at 5 or

657
00:33:43.540 --> 00:33:45.939
10 other cultures, you realize, well, there may be

658
00:33:45.939 --> 00:33:48.180
other things that are just as important, but we

659
00:33:48.180 --> 00:33:50.939
haven't really paid attention to them because they're less

660
00:33:50.939 --> 00:33:54.099
well documented or because traditions of scholarship in my

661
00:33:54.099 --> 00:33:56.229
own field have paid less attention to those values.

662
00:33:57.420 --> 00:34:00.130
So I think this kind of basic Awareness is

663
00:34:00.130 --> 00:34:03.770
not a bonus feature. It is essential to being

664
00:34:03.770 --> 00:34:06.890
a proper historian. Not everybody would agree, but that's

665
00:34:06.890 --> 00:34:10.139
my somewhat radical, uh, position. But at the very

666
00:34:10.139 --> 00:34:13.449
least, this kind of awareness would, um, help us,

667
00:34:13.570 --> 00:34:18.239
you know, do even our Approach our own specialisms

668
00:34:18.458 --> 00:34:20.697
in a more promising way. And then on top

669
00:34:20.697 --> 00:34:23.697
of that, if people are willing to do systematic

670
00:34:23.697 --> 00:34:27.178
comparative work, that's great. And again, that's probably best

671
00:34:27.178 --> 00:34:29.618
done in teams. If you have two or more

672
00:34:29.618 --> 00:34:33.378
people getting together, working on a shared problem, on

673
00:34:33.378 --> 00:34:36.299
a shared on a shared project, uh, that's probably

674
00:34:36.299 --> 00:34:38.678
the best way to do it because you can

675
00:34:38.678 --> 00:34:42.478
pool individual expertise, which is always in short supply.

676
00:34:42.708 --> 00:34:46.188
It's always compartmentalized and by bringing people together, you

677
00:34:46.188 --> 00:34:49.030
can create this kind of new knowledge that individuals

678
00:34:49.030 --> 00:34:51.668
have a hard time creating. It does happen once

679
00:34:51.668 --> 00:34:54.590
in a while, but you can't rely on genius

680
00:34:54.590 --> 00:34:57.550
level polymaths who could just handle these things. It

681
00:34:57.550 --> 00:35:00.790
has to be feasible for ordinary people, for regular

682
00:35:00.790 --> 00:35:03.389
scholars to engage in this kind of work, and

683
00:35:03.389 --> 00:35:07.270
that would certainly create, require a great deal more

684
00:35:07.270 --> 00:35:09.149
collaboration than we have seen in the past.

685
00:35:11.050 --> 00:35:13.739
In regards to the classics, I don't know if

686
00:35:13.739 --> 00:35:15.820
you agree with me, but I think that because

687
00:35:15.820 --> 00:35:18.219
of the way they are structured, they tend to

688
00:35:18.219 --> 00:35:23.979
be characterized as Eurocentric elitist and historically associated with

689
00:35:23.979 --> 00:35:28.139
white supremacy and colonialism. So what can be done

690
00:35:28.139 --> 00:35:28.760
about them?

691
00:35:29.790 --> 00:35:31.540
Um, AND I should say, in fact, it's not

692
00:35:31.540 --> 00:35:33.870
just a European problem. There are Chinese classics too,

693
00:35:33.989 --> 00:35:36.290
right? And, and especially the current regime in China

694
00:35:36.290 --> 00:35:38.870
is certainly doubling down on this, right? And Mao

695
00:35:38.870 --> 00:35:40.939
tried to get rid of the Confucian tradition, but

696
00:35:40.939 --> 00:35:44.389
his successors have re-embraced it. And what if you

697
00:35:44.389 --> 00:35:46.229
look at what goes on in India under the

698
00:35:46.229 --> 00:35:50.469
current government, again, it's a pretty sort of nationalistic

699
00:35:50.469 --> 00:35:53.590
kind of engagement with the legacies of India, specifically

700
00:35:53.590 --> 00:35:55.389
and the Hindu and the Sanskrit tradition and so

701
00:35:55.389 --> 00:35:57.219
on. So I should say it's not just Europe.

702
00:35:57.270 --> 00:35:59.679
The European tradition is the most powerful and dominant

703
00:35:59.679 --> 00:36:03.070
and best known, but it's not unique in that

704
00:36:03.070 --> 00:36:07.080
regard. So having this kind of narrow focus is

705
00:36:07.080 --> 00:36:09.669
a problem wherever it occurs, whether it's in Europe

706
00:36:09.669 --> 00:36:12.199
or America or in other parts of the world,

707
00:36:12.560 --> 00:36:15.760
we should transcend it. It's in our own interest

708
00:36:15.760 --> 00:36:18.969
to transcend it, A, to understand the world better,

709
00:36:19.159 --> 00:36:22.280
and B, arguably, this sounds very lofty, but maybe

710
00:36:22.280 --> 00:36:24.679
to make the world a better place, right? If

711
00:36:24.679 --> 00:36:27.879
we have a better, more sympathetic Understanding of the

712
00:36:27.879 --> 00:36:32.919
origins of other um societies, realizing that their starting

713
00:36:32.919 --> 00:36:36.080
conditions weren't necessarily all that different from our own,

714
00:36:36.399 --> 00:36:40.560
that by itself should help us, um, be, you

715
00:36:40.560 --> 00:36:43.350
know, feel a greater affinity, if you will, uh,

716
00:36:43.399 --> 00:36:45.840
to people in other parts of the world and

717
00:36:45.840 --> 00:36:47.639
understand that we are all part of the same

718
00:36:47.639 --> 00:36:51.199
planetary story, which I think is really important. Because

719
00:36:51.209 --> 00:36:53.810
the problems we face today are planetary in scale,

720
00:36:54.050 --> 00:36:56.520
whether it's the environment, climate change, you name it.

721
00:36:56.850 --> 00:37:00.050
These are not problems of just one people or

722
00:37:00.050 --> 00:37:03.010
one cultural group. They are planetary problems, and we

723
00:37:03.010 --> 00:37:06.110
have to engage them on a planetary scale. And

724
00:37:06.250 --> 00:37:10.370
in that respect, having a planetary understanding of our

725
00:37:10.370 --> 00:37:12.070
roots would be very helpful.

726
00:37:13.360 --> 00:37:16.300
Do you think that the reforms you propose in

727
00:37:16.300 --> 00:37:18.429
your book are likely to occur?

728
00:37:20.870 --> 00:37:22.750
The answer is yes and no, or rather no

729
00:37:22.750 --> 00:37:26.449
and yes. No, because of what I mentioned earlier,

730
00:37:26.469 --> 00:37:30.989
institutional inertia. There's also self-selection. People who enter certain

731
00:37:30.989 --> 00:37:34.139
fields into them because they like what they see.

732
00:37:34.429 --> 00:37:38.229
They select for the way things, the way things

733
00:37:38.229 --> 00:37:41.270
are currently being done. There may be other people

734
00:37:41.270 --> 00:37:43.899
who might prefer things to be different, but they

735
00:37:43.899 --> 00:37:46.550
may not join right now because they see what's

736
00:37:46.550 --> 00:37:48.469
happening and they may be put off and they

737
00:37:48.469 --> 00:37:51.290
might do something else instead. So these are formidable

738
00:37:51.290 --> 00:37:55.729
obstacles. Change may well happen for the somewhat wrong

739
00:37:55.729 --> 00:38:01.850
reasons, i.e., financial reasons, consolidation, academic administrators, government, legislators

740
00:38:01.850 --> 00:38:05.639
deciding we can't afford to have separate. You know,

741
00:38:07.159 --> 00:38:08.790
units for the Greeks and the Romans and the

742
00:38:08.790 --> 00:38:10.919
Egyptians and the Chinese and all these people, we

743
00:38:10.919 --> 00:38:15.600
consolidate them into broader units. That's not such a

744
00:38:15.600 --> 00:38:18.639
terrible outcome unless it involves major cuts, which of

745
00:38:18.639 --> 00:38:21.520
course often does. That's a problem. It shouldn't be

746
00:38:21.520 --> 00:38:23.600
driven by funding concerns. It should be driven by

747
00:38:23.600 --> 00:38:27.040
an intellectual agenda, but it's in a way there

748
00:38:27.040 --> 00:38:29.840
is almost a bit of an alignment between what

749
00:38:29.840 --> 00:38:33.239
I think should happen and by what is in

750
00:38:33.239 --> 00:38:36.560
the interest of institutions in terms of their funding

751
00:38:36.560 --> 00:38:41.004
and their. Organization to have uh uh lower barriers

752
00:38:41.344 --> 00:38:44.824
between units, more communication among people who work on

753
00:38:44.824 --> 00:38:49.485
similar things, and eventually greater consolidation in terms of

754
00:38:49.485 --> 00:38:52.685
how we organize uh the production of knowledge.

755
00:38:53.985 --> 00:38:56.264
What would you say is the true impact of

756
00:38:56.264 --> 00:39:00.185
ancient history in our, on our lives today?

757
00:39:01.060 --> 00:39:02.389
I think it goes back to what I said

758
00:39:02.389 --> 00:39:05.669
earlier that everything we do is some kind of

759
00:39:05.669 --> 00:39:08.870
supercharged version of what people came up with back

760
00:39:08.870 --> 00:39:11.350
in the day. We eat more food, we have

761
00:39:11.350 --> 00:39:14.310
more farming, we have genetic engineering, we use more

762
00:39:14.310 --> 00:39:16.929
metal, we use more fuel. We have bigger cities.

763
00:39:16.989 --> 00:39:19.629
We have more powerful governments. We have way more

764
00:39:19.629 --> 00:39:24.510
literacy. We have more of many of the things

765
00:39:24.510 --> 00:39:27.120
that people came up with in the past, but

766
00:39:27.120 --> 00:39:30.270
deep down they are still the same things. We

767
00:39:30.270 --> 00:39:35.560
haven't really invented anything that would be genuinely intrinsically

768
00:39:35.560 --> 00:39:38.159
new, the way those things were new when they

769
00:39:38.159 --> 00:39:42.239
were first developed 5000 or 10,000 years ago, depending

770
00:39:42.239 --> 00:39:45.439
on where we look. So in that sense, antiquity

771
00:39:45.439 --> 00:39:47.193
has won. I think I say this somewhere in

772
00:39:47.193 --> 00:39:50.393
the book, we are the products of antiquity. We

773
00:39:50.393 --> 00:39:55.032
haven't really transcended the ancient world. We have modified

774
00:39:55.032 --> 00:39:58.193
and upgraded the things that were developed back then,

775
00:39:58.472 --> 00:40:02.113
but we are firmly trapped in the creations of

776
00:40:02.113 --> 00:40:05.232
this particular phase of development, and we should very

777
00:40:05.232 --> 00:40:08.072
much be aware of this, because if we are

778
00:40:08.072 --> 00:40:11.946
interested in doing things differently in transformative change. We

779
00:40:11.946 --> 00:40:14.186
must have a good understanding of how things got

780
00:40:14.186 --> 00:40:16.305
to be the way they are. And in order

781
00:40:16.305 --> 00:40:18.496
to do that, we can't just study the last

782
00:40:18.936 --> 00:40:22.105
50 years, 100 years, 500 years, saying it's all

783
00:40:22.105 --> 00:40:25.746
about, you know, all the popular things, colonization, all

784
00:40:25.746 --> 00:40:27.585
the rest of it. That's part of the story,

785
00:40:27.825 --> 00:40:31.426
but it's all the latest step in a much

786
00:40:31.426 --> 00:40:35.565
longer process that reaches back into this foundational period

787
00:40:35.706 --> 00:40:36.865
of ancient history.

788
00:40:38.120 --> 00:40:40.760
I have one last question, then, how do you

789
00:40:40.760 --> 00:40:43.729
look at the future of ancient studies?

790
00:40:44.689 --> 00:40:47.459
I think there are two directions that are not

791
00:40:47.459 --> 00:40:50.899
just promising but probably inevitable in the long run.

792
00:40:51.300 --> 00:40:53.179
One is the one we already talked about, a

793
00:40:53.179 --> 00:40:57.429
more global perspective. The other is a greater convergence

794
00:40:57.429 --> 00:41:00.139
between the study of history in particular and what

795
00:41:00.139 --> 00:41:02.780
people do in other domains in the social sciences

796
00:41:02.780 --> 00:41:06.320
and especially in the life sciences. I think in

797
00:41:06.320 --> 00:41:10.219
particular of the ancient DNA revolution that we now

798
00:41:10.219 --> 00:41:15.850
have knowledge of the pre-literate past of population movements,

799
00:41:16.219 --> 00:41:20.699
of people's behavior, of kinship, of any number of

800
00:41:20.699 --> 00:41:24.199
very basic features going back many thousands of years

801
00:41:24.379 --> 00:41:26.979
we could not have dreamt of even 10 or

802
00:41:26.979 --> 00:41:30.014
15 years ago. It has been an enormous revolution

803
00:41:30.014 --> 00:41:33.375
in terms of what we're able to derive from

804
00:41:33.375 --> 00:41:38.014
the evidence of ancient genetics of DNA extracted from

805
00:41:38.014 --> 00:41:41.455
ancient bodies. We have made similar strides in terms

806
00:41:41.455 --> 00:41:44.614
of climate research, needless to say, going back a

807
00:41:44.614 --> 00:41:46.895
very long time to see how the climate has

808
00:41:46.895 --> 00:41:51.455
behaved over time. There are other aspects of scientific

809
00:41:51.455 --> 00:41:56.550
progress is rapid. Methods become cheaper, more accessible. It

810
00:41:56.550 --> 00:42:00.699
will in the long term revolutionize our understanding of

811
00:42:00.699 --> 00:42:05.449
early, pre-literate or scarcely literate societies because it will

812
00:42:05.449 --> 00:42:08.929
produce a huge abundance of material that wasn't previously

813
00:42:08.929 --> 00:42:12.885
available and will finally help us overcome. The division

814
00:42:13.274 --> 00:42:17.665
between history of literate societies and the prehistory of

815
00:42:17.665 --> 00:42:20.425
non-literate societies. So I think those are the two

816
00:42:20.425 --> 00:42:23.504
growth areas, the major growth areas when it comes

817
00:42:23.504 --> 00:42:28.294
to ancient studies, globalization on the one hand and

818
00:42:28.294 --> 00:42:31.084
a greater collaboration with science on the other.

819
00:42:32.560 --> 00:42:35.669
Great, so the book is again what is Ancient

820
00:42:35.669 --> 00:42:37.879
History. I'm leaving a link to it in the

821
00:42:37.879 --> 00:42:41.760
description of the interview. And Doctor Scheidel, just before

822
00:42:41.760 --> 00:42:44.479
we go apart from the book, would you like

823
00:42:44.479 --> 00:42:47.159
to tell people where they can find your work

824
00:42:47.159 --> 00:42:48.179
on the internet?

825
00:42:48.870 --> 00:42:50.790
Oh, they can find my work on the internet

826
00:42:50.790 --> 00:42:54.070
by Googling because I'm, I have, I'm fortunate in

827
00:42:54.070 --> 00:42:56.709
that my name, Walter Scheidler is very uncommon. I

828
00:42:56.709 --> 00:42:59.550
think I'm the only well-known person with that name.

829
00:42:59.659 --> 00:43:02.669
So if you Google me, it's uh almost inevitable

830
00:43:02.669 --> 00:43:05.979
that you come across, uh, my work, uh, my

831
00:43:05.979 --> 00:43:09.270
own website, various links on Amazon, on various places.

832
00:43:09.310 --> 00:43:11.959
You can see the various books I've published. I

833
00:43:11.959 --> 00:43:14.590
published a big history of the Uh, uh, uh,

834
00:43:14.790 --> 00:43:16.709
history of inequality from the Stone Age to the

835
00:43:16.709 --> 00:43:20.239
21st century. I've published work on, on state formation,

836
00:43:20.310 --> 00:43:23.840
the origins of modernity, uh, on ancient demography, the

837
00:43:23.840 --> 00:43:26.489
ancient economy, any number of things. And of course,

838
00:43:26.570 --> 00:43:29.649
increasingly, even academic articles, if people are interested in

839
00:43:29.649 --> 00:43:33.030
this kind of work are now increasingly available again

840
00:43:33.030 --> 00:43:35.770
via Google Scholar, you can click on them. They're

841
00:43:35.770 --> 00:43:39.530
often um accessible in some format. I've published a

842
00:43:39.530 --> 00:43:41.570
great deal of my work as working papers that

843
00:43:41.570 --> 00:43:44.530
is not copyrighted, that can easily be um accessed.

844
00:43:44.610 --> 00:43:46.969
So there's a, uh, a rather daunting amount of

845
00:43:46.969 --> 00:43:48.649
my work out there, and it's very easy to

846
00:43:48.649 --> 00:43:50.530
find just by Googling my name.

847
00:43:51.929 --> 00:43:54.500
OK, so thank you so much for taking the

848
00:43:54.500 --> 00:43:56.530
time to come on the show. It's been a

849
00:43:56.530 --> 00:43:57.729
pleasure to talk with you.

850
00:43:58.139 --> 00:44:00.219
It has been a real pleasure. Thanks, thanks a

851
00:44:00.219 --> 00:44:01.540
lot for having me on your program.

852
00:44:02.979 --> 00:44:05.500
