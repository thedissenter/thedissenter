00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:03.059
Hello, everyone. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:03.059 --> 00:00:06.239
Dissenter. I'm your host, as always, Ricardo Lopes, and

3
00:00:06.239 --> 00:00:09.840
today I'm joined by Doctor Gabriel Zamos Cregueros. He's

4
00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.050
associate professor of philosophy in the College of Liberal

5
00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:16.440
Arts and Science at the University of Colorado, Denver.

6
00:00:16.809 --> 00:00:20.110
And today we're going to talk about some topics

7
00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:25.319
in Nietzsche's psychology, uh, philosophy, sorry. So, Doctor Zamos

8
00:00:25.319 --> 00:00:27.870
Gregueros, welcome to the show. It's a huge pleasure

9
00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:28.489
to everyone.

10
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.239
Thank you so much, Ricardo. Thank you for inviting

11
00:00:31.239 --> 00:00:33.599
me. It's a great honor to be here, uh,

12
00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:35.639
with you and your audience and uh I hope

13
00:00:35.639 --> 00:00:38.159
we can have a good interview and conversation.

14
00:00:39.209 --> 00:00:42.319
Great. So I would like to start by asking

15
00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:47.290
you about some of the ideals of Nietzsche that

16
00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:49.849
you talk about in your work. So you've done

17
00:00:49.849 --> 00:00:54.060
work on the ideals of sovereignty, of wholeness, and

18
00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:58.430
of becoming what one is in Nietzsche's philosophy. So

19
00:00:59.209 --> 00:01:02.599
let's tackle each of them in turn. And discuss

20
00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:06.959
your views and interpretations of them, starting with becoming

21
00:01:06.959 --> 00:01:10.400
what one is. What is that really about?

22
00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:13.589
Yes, so as you say, I, I kind of,

23
00:01:13.639 --> 00:01:15.720
when I was writing my dissertation, I wanted to

24
00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.720
be, to focus it a little bit on the

25
00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:20.959
positive side of Nietzsche's philosophy. Typically, when you read

26
00:01:20.959 --> 00:01:24.440
Nietzsche, uh, you, you realize that, you know, Nietzsche

27
00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:26.910
is against all sorts of things. He's against Christian

28
00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:31.300
morality, democracy, all sorts of criticisms that he advances

29
00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:35.160
truth, perhaps even. Uh, METAPHYSICS, whatever. So, he has

30
00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:37.239
many negative things to say about all sorts of

31
00:01:37.239 --> 00:01:39.879
things, but I was always curious about, well, what

32
00:01:39.879 --> 00:01:41.790
is his positive philosophy? What is he, what is

33
00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.440
he proposing? What, what are his ideals? Does he

34
00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:47.129
have any, any interesting things to offer in terms

35
00:01:47.129 --> 00:01:50.279
of things he wants us to pursue or, or

36
00:01:50.279 --> 00:01:54.319
such? And that led me to focus on some

37
00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:56.720
of the ideals that he seems to be espousing.

38
00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:59.040
So, as you said, you, you mentioned becoming who

39
00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.080
you are or what you are. It's a phrase

40
00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:05.550
that recurs throughout all of, uh, uh, Nietzsche's, uh,

41
00:02:05.639 --> 00:02:10.529
philosophical development. You can find, uh, uh. Actually, the

42
00:02:10.529 --> 00:02:12.029
actual phrase you can find it even in the

43
00:02:12.029 --> 00:02:15.139
untimely meditations because he talks about Wagner in the

44
00:02:15.139 --> 00:02:18.300
Wagner meditation, Wagner in Breuth, uh, he talks about

45
00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:22.039
it, uh, as Wagner looking into himself and then

46
00:02:22.039 --> 00:02:24.919
this act of looking into himself, he describes as

47
00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:27.380
how Wagner became what he is and will be.

48
00:02:27.619 --> 00:02:29.820
So he actually uses that phrase in the, in

49
00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:34.029
the, in the third, uh. Meditation on Schopenhauer as

50
00:02:34.029 --> 00:02:37.389
educator, he, uh, tells us that, uh, you know,

51
00:02:37.479 --> 00:02:40.029
your conscience tells you be who you are or

52
00:02:40.029 --> 00:02:42.990
be yourself. He doesn't quite use that the expression

53
00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:44.949
as become who you are, but he says be

54
00:02:44.949 --> 00:02:47.509
yourself. Everything you're doing right now is not you

55
00:02:47.509 --> 00:02:51.149
yourself. You, you are inauthentic in some sense. So

56
00:02:51.149 --> 00:02:52.710
you, you get it there, then you see it

57
00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:56.429
echoed in, um, gay science, obviously in a passage

58
00:02:56.429 --> 00:02:59.589
that gets cited a lot. Uh, THE passage, I

59
00:02:59.589 --> 00:03:02.110
forget the numbers. I'm very bad at remembering, uh,

60
00:03:02.259 --> 00:03:05.350
section numbers and stuff, so forgive, forgive me for

61
00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:08.789
that, but, uh, you know, uh, he has that

62
00:03:08.789 --> 00:03:12.190
long passage about long-lived, long, uh, -lived physics, and

63
00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:15.100
he said, in that passage occurs the phrase in

64
00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:17.369
the context of saying something like, you know, we

65
00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:19.470
are the ones who want to become who we

66
00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:23.369
are, uh, beings who are unique, who create themselves,

67
00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:26.740
who give themselves laws, etc. Um, YOU find it

68
00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:30.380
in Zarathustra, where he says, uh, Zarathustra in the

69
00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:34.100
4th, uh, book says, you know, I am not

70
00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:36.169
for nothing, I am a person who's trying to

71
00:03:36.169 --> 00:03:39.059
fish, uh, men, right? He, he presents himself as

72
00:03:39.059 --> 00:03:41.380
a fisher of men, a person who's trying to

73
00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:43.410
raise, to raise up, not for nothing. I'm a

74
00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:46.720
person who's told himself once, become who you are,

75
00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:51.289
right? Uh, IT occurs, of course, uh, in the

76
00:03:51.289 --> 00:03:54.210
famous autobiography of Nietzsche as a subtitle, right? Uh,

77
00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:56.770
How One Becomes What One Is. So it's a

78
00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:59.610
phrase that is recurring everywhere. Another ideal that it,

79
00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:02.279
that seems to be present is this ideal of

80
00:04:02.279 --> 00:04:05.360
wholeness, uh, that, that people seem to have detected,

81
00:04:05.449 --> 00:04:08.320
right? Ntzsche wants us to become whole, uh, or,

82
00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:10.529
you know, Goethe in the Twilight of the Idols

83
00:04:10.529 --> 00:04:14.009
wanted totality or wholeness or completion or something like

84
00:04:14.009 --> 00:04:16.488
that. So, there seems to be some kind of

85
00:04:16.488 --> 00:04:19.358
ideal of wholeness. There also seems to be, for

86
00:04:19.358 --> 00:04:22.278
some people, at least, uh, although other people want

87
00:04:22.278 --> 00:04:26.039
to contend, uh, this claim, uh, the ideal of

88
00:04:26.039 --> 00:04:28.878
sovereignty in the genealogy, it's an important passage in

89
00:04:28.878 --> 00:04:31.658
the second Treaties of the Genealogy where Nietzsche presents

90
00:04:31.919 --> 00:04:35.519
the sovereign individual as the mankind come to completion.

91
00:04:35.598 --> 00:04:38.519
The tree of mankind that we've been, the genealogical

92
00:04:38.519 --> 00:04:40.889
tree that we've been uh uh retracing here in

93
00:04:40.889 --> 00:04:44.319
this book, Nietzsche tells us, culminates with this fruit.

94
00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:47.630
Uh, THAT, that, that is full of promise, the

95
00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:49.760
fruit of the sovereign individual. That seems to be

96
00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:51.880
an ideal that he, he, he wants to recommend

97
00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:54.839
to us. Moreover, notice the language of completion, right?

98
00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:58.589
The completion of mankind. So, just like, you know,

99
00:04:58.799 --> 00:05:00.559
uh, people who want to create themselves, who want

100
00:05:00.559 --> 00:05:02.600
to be unique, who want to represent the completion

101
00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:05.140
of mankind or something like that, uh, OK, so,

102
00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:08.299
these ideals, by the way, seem to be related

103
00:05:08.299 --> 00:05:10.440
to each other, and this is also part of

104
00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:12.149
what I want to just flag before I launch

105
00:05:12.149 --> 00:05:14.940
into trying to tell you my answer about What

106
00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:18.070
beyond, uh, uh, uh, becoming who you are, um,

107
00:05:18.459 --> 00:05:22.290
or what you are means, uh, that in some

108
00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:25.290
ways, I might end up repeating myself, uh, in,

109
00:05:25.369 --> 00:05:27.450
in the course of this investigation in some of

110
00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:31.450
the answers because as I study this, uh uh

111
00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:34.329
different ideals of Nietzsche's, I've come to the realization

112
00:05:34.329 --> 00:05:37.089
that there are things that repeat themselves. They're echoes

113
00:05:37.279 --> 00:05:40.970
of, uh, of, of, of, uh, the ways in

114
00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:44.089
which he conceptualize one. Of the ideals that are

115
00:05:44.089 --> 00:05:46.079
repeated in the ways in which you conceptualize the

116
00:05:46.079 --> 00:05:49.609
others, um, so, so all these ideals in some

117
00:05:49.609 --> 00:05:51.850
ways are different ways of talking about the same

118
00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:54.570
thing in the end, uh, I think when, when

119
00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:56.929
you read Nietzsche carefully, you kind of start to

120
00:05:56.929 --> 00:05:59.089
realize that's kind of what's going on. You could

121
00:05:59.089 --> 00:06:01.290
add other ideals that I don't discuss right now

122
00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:04.410
or maybe we won't discuss today, the superhuman ideal

123
00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:08.260
that Zarathus represents to us. I would probably lean

124
00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:11.040
towards the idea that this is another way of

125
00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:13.980
um speaking of the same thing so, so that

126
00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:16.899
the superhuman in some ways shares many features of

127
00:06:16.899 --> 00:06:20.260
the sovereign individual of the ideal of wholeness and

128
00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:22.390
of the ideal of becoming who you are. This

129
00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:25.540
is why Tustra himself explicitly says, I'm the one

130
00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:28.399
who told himself become who you are. So, um.

131
00:06:29.059 --> 00:06:31.380
So that's the first caveat. The second caveat I

132
00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:33.339
wanted to introduce that I'll be repeating myself as

133
00:06:33.339 --> 00:06:34.940
the first caveat, but the second caveat I want,

134
00:06:35.059 --> 00:06:38.019
I want to introduce is uh that there's something

135
00:06:38.019 --> 00:06:40.630
a little bit I, I don't know how to

136
00:06:40.630 --> 00:06:44.470
put this, uh, exactly, but artificial in the way

137
00:06:44.470 --> 00:06:47.869
we Nietzsche scholars approach N Nietzsche. We forget a

138
00:06:47.869 --> 00:06:52.589
little bit that Nietzsche is an outsider. Uh, HE

139
00:06:52.589 --> 00:06:55.869
comes to philosophy as an outsider. He's not really

140
00:06:55.869 --> 00:07:01.250
trained in philosophy. He has teleological, theological, sorry, uh,

141
00:07:01.989 --> 00:07:05.429
interest, as, as a young, very young man that

142
00:07:05.429 --> 00:07:10.670
he, of course, quickly. Uh, uh, SHIES away from,

143
00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.440
uh, in, in part thanks to his, uh, having

144
00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:17.359
been brought up in the classicist tradition, uh, and

145
00:07:17.359 --> 00:07:20.339
the humanitarian tradition of, uh, the, the school board

146
00:07:20.339 --> 00:07:22.709
that he attended, that he had the privilege to

147
00:07:22.709 --> 00:07:25.869
attend. And so he becomes, thanks to that influence,

148
00:07:25.950 --> 00:07:28.649
a philologist, but philology is also not philosophy, right?

149
00:07:28.709 --> 00:07:30.970
So he's, he's either, he, he was either a

150
00:07:31.230 --> 00:07:35.269
theologian trying to, you know, uh, following his father's

151
00:07:35.269 --> 00:07:38.269
footsteps perhaps, and become a priest or a pastor

152
00:07:38.269 --> 00:07:40.809
or somebody who thinks about God a lot, or

153
00:07:40.809 --> 00:07:44.029
um he became a kind of classicist in the

154
00:07:44.029 --> 00:07:46.829
end. Of course, in becoming a classicist and even

155
00:07:46.829 --> 00:07:51.369
also in in being a theologian, he He indirectly

156
00:07:51.369 --> 00:07:54.959
dabbles in philosophical concerns, of course, because these areas,

157
00:07:55.209 --> 00:07:57.010
if you're, if you're a classicist, you're gonna have

158
00:07:57.010 --> 00:08:00.209
to read the philo the ancient philosophers, right? Uh,

159
00:08:00.369 --> 00:08:02.160
AMONG the other things that you're gonna be reading.

160
00:08:02.489 --> 00:08:04.809
So, you're gonna read ancient philosophers and you're gonna

161
00:08:04.809 --> 00:08:07.910
get exposure to philosophy that way, for sure. But

162
00:08:07.910 --> 00:08:10.950
he's always an outsider. He's also an outsider in

163
00:08:10.950 --> 00:08:13.230
his own field of training in some ways because

164
00:08:13.230 --> 00:08:16.190
he does philology in a very weird way, and

165
00:08:16.190 --> 00:08:18.459
which is why he was chastised, uh, from the

166
00:08:18.459 --> 00:08:21.070
field in thanks to the publication of his first

167
00:08:21.070 --> 00:08:23.619
major book, Birth of Tragedy, as you may know.

168
00:08:24.029 --> 00:08:26.989
So, we forget this, and what, what I'm, why

169
00:08:26.989 --> 00:08:29.869
is this important? Because In some ways, Nietzsche is

170
00:08:29.869 --> 00:08:32.099
not a traditional philosopher. What this means is that

171
00:08:32.099 --> 00:08:33.869
when Nietzsche comes to philosophy, he doesn't come to

172
00:08:33.869 --> 00:08:37.590
philosophy with the traditional concerns of what people trained

173
00:08:37.590 --> 00:08:40.190
in the philosophical tradition, in the discipline of philosophy,

174
00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:43.929
let's say. Come with, right? So, and what are

175
00:08:43.929 --> 00:08:47.210
those? Typically, there are things like metaphysics and epistemology.

176
00:08:47.289 --> 00:08:49.289
I wanna know what is it to know? What

177
00:08:49.289 --> 00:08:52.880
is the difference between knowing something and just happening,

178
00:08:53.049 --> 00:08:55.760
happening to have a true opinion about something. Uh,

179
00:08:55.770 --> 00:08:59.119
WHAT exactly is truth anyways, uh, you know, things

180
00:08:59.119 --> 00:09:01.849
like that, or what is the nature of reality,

181
00:09:01.919 --> 00:09:04.130
right? What is the, the cosmos made of? What

182
00:09:04.130 --> 00:09:07.130
is the, what is, what? What exactly is nature?

183
00:09:07.250 --> 00:09:09.289
How does it work? Is it made of atoms?

184
00:09:09.369 --> 00:09:12.609
Is it, you know, uh what? OK. So, what

185
00:09:12.609 --> 00:09:14.849
is matter and then what is the relationship between

186
00:09:14.849 --> 00:09:17.599
matter and mind? I have minds and, and, uh,

187
00:09:17.609 --> 00:09:20.710
you know, materialistic philosophy seems to miss the mind,

188
00:09:20.849 --> 00:09:24.299
as Nietzsche, who read Lang would, would, would know.

189
00:09:24.380 --> 00:09:26.330
This is one of the recurring themes in, in

190
00:09:26.330 --> 00:09:28.969
Lang's history of materialism, which Nietzsche read very early

191
00:09:28.969 --> 00:09:31.260
on when he was very young. Uh, YOU know,

192
00:09:31.419 --> 00:09:34.539
that materialism, the, the, the thing that materialism cannot

193
00:09:34.539 --> 00:09:37.960
handle is experience, the, the mental, what, what today,

194
00:09:38.179 --> 00:09:40.539
uh, following Chalmer and others we call the hard

195
00:09:40.539 --> 00:09:43.059
problem of consciousness or something, right? OK, this is

196
00:09:43.059 --> 00:09:48.659
the repeated. A wall against which materialism cracks its

197
00:09:48.659 --> 00:09:53.080
head, OK? Um. These problems, or in, in the

198
00:09:53.080 --> 00:09:55.349
case that pertains to us, actually, let me just

199
00:09:55.349 --> 00:09:58.119
mention one last one. The problem, a sub-problem of

200
00:09:58.119 --> 00:10:00.840
a metaphysical field, the problem of free will, right?

201
00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.520
Is, is the world, is reality made in such

202
00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:05.960
a way that you can have creatures that have

203
00:10:05.960 --> 00:10:09.719
free will or does the nature of reality simply

204
00:10:09.719 --> 00:10:12.840
exclude the possibility of having creatures with a free

205
00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:15.520
will, right? That's a it's a, it's a field

206
00:10:15.520 --> 00:10:21.130
of a metaphysical problem. And so Nietzsche Even though

207
00:10:21.130 --> 00:10:26.700
he will make claims. That, of course, are claims

208
00:10:26.700 --> 00:10:29.140
that you would have to categorize, let's put, or

209
00:10:29.140 --> 00:10:33.030
put under the, the umbrella of metaphysical claims or

210
00:10:33.030 --> 00:10:37.179
claims about metaphysics, or claims about epistemology, or claims

211
00:10:37.179 --> 00:10:39.419
about free will, right? The, the debate on free

212
00:10:39.419 --> 00:10:44.960
will. Art He's making those claims not because he

213
00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:48.440
wants to contribute to the field of metaphysics or

214
00:10:48.440 --> 00:10:51.059
to contribute to the field of epistemology or even

215
00:10:51.359 --> 00:10:53.140
in in the case that I'm interested in perhaps

216
00:10:53.400 --> 00:10:58.039
the field of free will debates, OK, and I

217
00:10:58.039 --> 00:11:02.460
think that's important because when we miss that. We,

218
00:11:02.580 --> 00:11:06.340
we are in danger of falling into certain traps,

219
00:11:06.739 --> 00:11:08.659
OK? We, we're in danger of falling into certain

220
00:11:08.659 --> 00:11:11.059
traps when we approach Nietzsche's philosophy. We, we are

221
00:11:11.059 --> 00:11:12.729
in danger of, uh, I don't know, to, to

222
00:11:12.729 --> 00:11:16.020
use the kind of typical expression, missing the forest

223
00:11:16.020 --> 00:11:18.820
for the trees, right? And, and even missing the

224
00:11:18.820 --> 00:11:21.690
trees because we mischaracterize those trees, the, the, the,

225
00:11:21.739 --> 00:11:25.179
the metaphysical concerns that he supposedly has or the

226
00:11:25.590 --> 00:11:28.150
Uh, epistemological concern or his concern with free will,

227
00:11:28.270 --> 00:11:31.549
right? Uh, WE, we miss those things and in

228
00:11:31.549 --> 00:11:34.190
missing, and even in the, in themselves, but more

229
00:11:34.190 --> 00:11:36.710
importantly, we miss what Nietzsche is actually trying to

230
00:11:36.710 --> 00:11:39.830
do in his philosophy, which is not contribute to

231
00:11:39.830 --> 00:11:44.424
perhaps metaphysical. Debates or contribute to epistemological debates or

232
00:11:44.424 --> 00:11:47.705
contribute to the free will debate, OK, um, as

233
00:11:47.705 --> 00:11:51.304
we understand it. So, so that's it, that's a

234
00:11:51.304 --> 00:11:54.544
caveat I want to express here, right? So when

235
00:11:54.544 --> 00:11:58.409
we're looking for Uh, you know, uh, and, and

236
00:11:58.409 --> 00:12:00.530
it's, and, and part of the issue here too

237
00:12:00.530 --> 00:12:02.530
is that we have those concerns because we are

238
00:12:02.530 --> 00:12:05.619
trained as philosophers that we're interested in. In my

239
00:12:05.619 --> 00:12:07.340
case, the free will debate a little bit, right?

240
00:12:07.940 --> 00:12:12.119
That's one of my interests. OK, fantastic. Um, BUT

241
00:12:13.210 --> 00:12:16.969
In, in, in bringing this interest into Nietzsche's philosophy,

242
00:12:17.049 --> 00:12:21.229
I, I may end up uh uh twisting Nietzsche's

243
00:12:21.229 --> 00:12:25.820
philosophy beyond recognition because I kind of foist and

244
00:12:25.890 --> 00:12:29.989
onto Nietzsche and a demand that, that he answer

245
00:12:30.169 --> 00:12:33.390
the questions that I'm interested in. Even though he

246
00:12:33.390 --> 00:12:35.950
maybe doesn't want to, right? He's, he's doing something

247
00:12:35.950 --> 00:12:38.150
else. And so that's a, a pitfall, that's a

248
00:12:38.150 --> 00:12:40.869
danger I can fall into very easily. I can

249
00:12:40.869 --> 00:12:44.219
start reconstructing Nietzsche's metaphysics, trying to reconstruct it, right?

250
00:12:44.630 --> 00:12:46.419
When maybe Nietzsche was not interested in giving you

251
00:12:46.419 --> 00:12:48.969
a coherent picture of what his metaphysics were, OK?

252
00:12:49.229 --> 00:12:51.270
Um, AND, and stuff like that. So this is

253
00:12:51.270 --> 00:12:53.799
a, this is a, a, a danger. That I

254
00:12:53.799 --> 00:12:55.840
think we have to be wary of, we have

255
00:12:55.840 --> 00:12:58.030
to be aware of, and we have to try

256
00:12:58.030 --> 00:13:00.919
to bring to mind when we're trying to do

257
00:13:00.919 --> 00:13:02.679
these reconstructions because the other thing I want to

258
00:13:02.679 --> 00:13:05.320
say is I'm not disparaging of the effort of

259
00:13:05.320 --> 00:13:08.140
trying to figure out what Nietzsche's moral psychology is,

260
00:13:08.400 --> 00:13:10.359
or to try to figure out what Nietzsche's metaphysics

261
00:13:10.359 --> 00:13:12.200
is, or to try to figure out what Nietzsche

262
00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:13.880
had to say about the free will debate, if

263
00:13:13.880 --> 00:13:16.780
he had any position that I can. Reconstruct or

264
00:13:16.780 --> 00:13:20.789
whatever in him. I don't disparage of those efforts.

265
00:13:21.250 --> 00:13:23.330
I, I think they're valuable and we can learn

266
00:13:23.330 --> 00:13:26.099
things about Nietzsche's philosophy, but we do, we should

267
00:13:26.099 --> 00:13:27.940
keep in mind that in some ways, they're artificial.

268
00:13:28.059 --> 00:13:31.099
They're not really what Nietzsche is doing, OK? And

269
00:13:31.099 --> 00:13:33.340
that we therefore have to be careful not to

270
00:13:33.340 --> 00:13:36.859
miss what Nietzsche's actually doing. And so, having said

271
00:13:36.859 --> 00:13:39.260
that, of course I myself am guilty of trying

272
00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:42.409
to do a kind of reconstruction sometimes of, uh,

273
00:13:42.580 --> 00:13:44.409
you know, what is Nietzsche saying, for instance, in,

274
00:13:44.580 --> 00:13:46.859
in becoming who you are, to come, to come

275
00:13:46.859 --> 00:13:50.299
back to your question now, uh, forgive me, I'll

276
00:13:50.299 --> 00:13:51.940
take, I'll take sips of water every once in

277
00:13:51.940 --> 00:13:53.510
a while. I hope that's OK. No,

278
00:13:53.900 --> 00:13:54.539
that's OK.

279
00:13:56.250 --> 00:14:00.020
Um, OK, so. Uh, uh, uh, YOU know, in

280
00:14:00.020 --> 00:14:02.059
the, in my case of trying to figure out

281
00:14:02.059 --> 00:14:04.929
what Nietzsche has to say about, uh, becoming who

282
00:14:04.929 --> 00:14:11.419
you are, um, I'm, I'm, uh, uh interest, I

283
00:14:11.419 --> 00:14:14.200
was, I, I came into that debate. And by

284
00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:17.440
the way, this is not published, uh, the, the,

285
00:14:17.460 --> 00:14:19.359
uh, uh, it's, it's published as part of my

286
00:14:19.359 --> 00:14:22.280
dissertation. So, in my dissertation, I tackled those three

287
00:14:22.280 --> 00:14:24.390
ideals that you mentioned, becoming who you are, wholeness,

288
00:14:24.400 --> 00:14:28.510
and sovereignty, but I've actually only published, uh, uh,

289
00:14:28.520 --> 00:14:31.599
versions of what I wrote in my dissertation for

290
00:14:31.599 --> 00:14:34.039
the ideals of wholeness and for the ideals, of

291
00:14:34.039 --> 00:14:37.179
sovereignty. I haven't really published, uh, what I wrote

292
00:14:37.179 --> 00:14:40.659
about becoming who you are. Uh, BUT it's still

293
00:14:40.659 --> 00:14:42.820
available online if people are interested in reading it,

294
00:14:42.900 --> 00:14:44.859
so you can, you can find my dissertation online,

295
00:14:44.940 --> 00:14:46.780
probably if you Google me and you, you find

296
00:14:46.780 --> 00:14:49.190
the dissertation, you'll be able to read it. Uh,

297
00:14:49.539 --> 00:14:51.299
IN the, in the case of becoming who you

298
00:14:51.299 --> 00:14:54.539
are, uh, I kind of, uh, went into it

299
00:14:54.539 --> 00:14:57.869
because there was a, a sort of debate that,

300
00:14:58.059 --> 00:15:00.659
uh, in the literature about how to understand becoming

301
00:15:00.659 --> 00:15:04.000
who you are, framed, uh, in terms of two

302
00:15:04.260 --> 00:15:07.419
sort of posi positions, right? One was, uh, Nehama's

303
00:15:07.419 --> 00:15:11.172
position where becoming who You are, it's about organizing,

304
00:15:11.393 --> 00:15:15.232
uh, yourself or your, your mental life to some

305
00:15:15.232 --> 00:15:19.612
extent or yourself, uh, uh, into a narrative unity

306
00:15:20.112 --> 00:15:23.223
in the way literature kind of, uh, create constructs

307
00:15:23.223 --> 00:15:26.513
narratives, uh, where you organize what you think, what

308
00:15:26.513 --> 00:15:29.145
you want, what you desire in. To this kind

309
00:15:29.145 --> 00:15:31.895
of narrative unity. And then there is the, uh,

310
00:15:31.906 --> 00:15:34.736
sort of, uh, Brian Leiter position, for instance, uh,

311
00:15:34.745 --> 00:15:36.825
that wants to see becoming who you are as

312
00:15:36.825 --> 00:15:40.346
a kind of causally determined process where you're destined

313
00:15:40.346 --> 00:15:44.346
to become what you were always naturally, uh, uh,

314
00:15:44.356 --> 00:15:46.986
destined to become because of your essential natural properties

315
00:15:46.986 --> 00:15:49.979
or, or characteristics or something like that. With very

316
00:15:49.979 --> 00:15:52.340
diametrically opposed right ways of thinking, and I was

317
00:15:52.340 --> 00:15:54.700
like, well, let me explore what does it mean

318
00:15:54.700 --> 00:15:56.419
to become who you are according to Nietzsche in

319
00:15:56.419 --> 00:15:59.940
the book that bears the subtitle, uh, in the

320
00:15:59.940 --> 00:16:03.690
phrase in its subtitle, namely, e que homo, um,

321
00:16:04.020 --> 00:16:09.659
what exactly is Nietzsche, uh, here? Uh, DOING, what

322
00:16:09.659 --> 00:16:11.619
does he have to say about how you become

323
00:16:11.619 --> 00:16:15.440
who you are, and does that reveal Whether N

324
00:16:15.450 --> 00:16:19.440
Nietzsche is thinking that human beings have no genial

325
00:16:19.440 --> 00:16:22.080
capacity like Leiter wants, wants us to, to, to

326
00:16:22.080 --> 00:16:25.780
think, or whether, uh, Nietzsche thinks that humans do

327
00:16:25.780 --> 00:16:27.880
have some kind of a genial capacity to contribute

328
00:16:27.880 --> 00:16:30.359
to the process of becoming who they are, uh,

329
00:16:30.400 --> 00:16:32.780
in some way which would, would, which would imply

330
00:16:32.880 --> 00:16:34.820
they have some kind of autonomy or free will

331
00:16:34.820 --> 00:16:39.400
in what they're doing, OK, um, and, and then,

332
00:16:39.520 --> 00:16:41.599
you know, maybe ask questions about, well, but is

333
00:16:41.599 --> 00:16:45.239
that about organizing yourself in the way that. Uh,

334
00:16:45.400 --> 00:16:48.840
Nehamas things or not, OK? Um, AND so, when

335
00:16:48.840 --> 00:16:51.400
I did that, and, and I started to explore,

336
00:16:51.479 --> 00:16:53.679
I, I noticed that there, there are, of course,

337
00:16:53.799 --> 00:16:59.380
many, many, um, Things Nietzsche says in Eke homo.

338
00:17:00.710 --> 00:17:04.618
That it sound like the picture of uh uh

339
00:17:04.660 --> 00:17:08.420
fatalism that uh Brian Leiter uh likes to emphasize,

340
00:17:08.729 --> 00:17:11.150
right? Nietzsche talks about instincts that he has that

341
00:17:11.150 --> 00:17:14.589
kind of direct him to particular places and, and

342
00:17:14.589 --> 00:17:18.069
do all those kinds of things, um, but he

343
00:17:18.069 --> 00:17:22.229
also, uh, has other moments where he seems to

344
00:17:22.229 --> 00:17:28.167
speak of reflection and Consciousness and self-knowledge and coming

345
00:17:28.167 --> 00:17:32.509
to reflect and find reason in reality prompted by

346
00:17:32.509 --> 00:17:35.428
the fact that he was sick, um, which have

347
00:17:35.428 --> 00:17:38.668
a consequence that sounds a little bit contrary to

348
00:17:38.668 --> 00:17:42.088
what the, the lighter picture is presenting us, namely

349
00:17:42.348 --> 00:17:45.149
the consequence of actually creating instincts in you that

350
00:17:45.149 --> 00:17:47.348
you didn't have before. So there's a point in

351
00:17:47.348 --> 00:17:49.068
uhque home, I forget which section exactly. I think

352
00:17:49.068 --> 00:17:51.389
it's the, it might be the, why am I

353
00:17:51.389 --> 00:17:56.750
so, um. Uh, CLEVER or, or intelligent, uh, section,

354
00:17:57.050 --> 00:18:01.089
um, where he says, I have an, uh, you

355
00:18:01.089 --> 00:18:04.280
know, the, the, the people need to have an

356
00:18:04.280 --> 00:18:10.369
instinct of self-defense, which is also called taste. To,

357
00:18:10.449 --> 00:18:13.329
you know, preserve their task and their, and their,

358
00:18:13.410 --> 00:18:15.729
uh, and their uniqueness and their, so they can

359
00:18:15.729 --> 00:18:18.280
become who they are. And I totally lacked it,

360
00:18:18.449 --> 00:18:21.449
OK? I had no instinct of self-defense for the

361
00:18:21.449 --> 00:18:24.130
longest part of my life. I lacked this ins

362
00:18:24.130 --> 00:18:26.295
I lacked the instinct. It It was thanks to

363
00:18:26.295 --> 00:18:29.104
my sickness that I started to reflect and find

364
00:18:29.104 --> 00:18:32.145
reason in reality, and thanks to this reflection and

365
00:18:32.145 --> 00:18:34.895
this finding reason in reality, I developed in the

366
00:18:34.895 --> 00:18:36.625
last 10 years of my life the instinct of

367
00:18:36.625 --> 00:18:40.045
self-defense, basically is what he's saying, OK? I finally

368
00:18:40.344 --> 00:18:44.640
developed this instinct. Uh, WHICH now seems to, uh,

369
00:18:44.650 --> 00:18:49.050
posit a kind of agential capacity that works by

370
00:18:49.050 --> 00:18:51.849
way of what typically we think agential capacities or

371
00:18:51.849 --> 00:18:54.829
free will in the human being works, namely by

372
00:18:54.829 --> 00:18:57.729
practical deliberation. There's some kind of practical deliberation. You're

373
00:18:57.729 --> 00:19:00.449
using your reason. You come to know something about

374
00:19:00.449 --> 00:19:03.719
yourself, and this self-knowledge transforms the way you, uh,

375
00:19:03.729 --> 00:19:06.670
act in the world, right? Uh, SO your self-understanding.

376
00:19:08.510 --> 00:19:12.739
Creates intentions in you that then you, uh, go

377
00:19:12.739 --> 00:19:15.869
out into the world to manifest, right, um, in

378
00:19:15.869 --> 00:19:17.310
the, in the, in the, in the, in this

379
00:19:17.310 --> 00:19:19.229
case, the intention to create an instinct of freedom

380
00:19:19.229 --> 00:19:21.380
and to cultivate it in the right way, uh,

381
00:19:21.390 --> 00:19:22.910
sorry, not an instinct of freedom, it's instinct of

382
00:19:22.910 --> 00:19:25.660
self-defense and cultivate it in the right way, right?

383
00:19:26.189 --> 00:19:29.300
Uh, THERE is also another moment in Nietzsche's, uh,

384
00:19:29.310 --> 00:19:32.349
actually the moment where he finally tells us how

385
00:19:32.349 --> 00:19:34.349
you become what you are, right? He comes a

386
00:19:34.349 --> 00:19:36.449
there comes a moment in Ekehomo where he says,

387
00:19:37.439 --> 00:19:40.439
I can no longer delay telling you, reader, how

388
00:19:40.439 --> 00:19:42.760
you become who you are. You become how you

389
00:19:42.760 --> 00:19:46.619
are by keeping your, your, your autonomy agency away

390
00:19:46.869 --> 00:19:50.800
uh uh from become, by not understanding yourself too

391
00:19:50.800 --> 00:19:54.439
quickly, by not engaging in this process of self-knowledge

392
00:19:54.439 --> 00:19:57.479
and self-reflection too quickly, right? You have to be

393
00:19:57.479 --> 00:20:00.199
careful, you have to guard against your autonomy, against

394
00:20:00.199 --> 00:20:03.520
this capacity you have. To, through your reflection and

395
00:20:03.520 --> 00:20:06.760
your rationality, inject yourself into the causal stream of

396
00:20:06.760 --> 00:20:08.900
your life, right? You have to be careful because

397
00:20:09.079 --> 00:20:11.219
injecting yourself into the causal stream of your life

398
00:20:11.479 --> 00:20:14.839
too soon when you don't really have a correct

399
00:20:14.839 --> 00:20:18.400
understanding of who you are is problematic, right? This

400
00:20:18.400 --> 00:20:22.160
is something that, that he says, uh, in, in,

401
00:20:22.189 --> 00:20:24.359
in Eke homo 2. So this again would be,

402
00:20:24.439 --> 00:20:27.280
would mean, oh, we have a practical capacity, we

403
00:20:27.280 --> 00:20:29.670
have some kind of free will. That functions in

404
00:20:29.670 --> 00:20:32.670
the way that typically free wills have been characterized

405
00:20:32.670 --> 00:20:39.969
to function, namely self-reflection, self-understanding, reason, right, rationality, self-knowledge,

406
00:20:40.319 --> 00:20:43.550
and With this self-knowledge and reflection and all that

407
00:20:43.550 --> 00:20:46.300
stuff, you form intentions that are truly your own

408
00:20:46.300 --> 00:20:48.599
and you inject yourself into the causal stream of

409
00:20:48.599 --> 00:20:50.439
the world. Now, I don't know if I actually

410
00:20:50.439 --> 00:20:52.479
answered your question about what is it to become

411
00:20:52.479 --> 00:20:55.260
who you are because of course, uh, you're supposed

412
00:20:55.260 --> 00:21:02.260
to. Prevent your autonomy from. Knowing itself too quickly

413
00:21:02.260 --> 00:21:05.630
and therefore intervening in your life too quickly, uh,

414
00:21:05.780 --> 00:21:08.500
Nietzsche, Nietzsche says, you know, in particular, you should

415
00:21:08.500 --> 00:21:12.050
guard against, uh, you know, all great gestures, right?

416
00:21:12.300 --> 00:21:15.319
So becoming attached to great causes or all great,

417
00:21:15.380 --> 00:21:18.719
uh, uh, he should, he should, he should probably,

418
00:21:18.780 --> 00:21:19.969
I don't think he mentioned it, but he should

419
00:21:19.969 --> 00:21:22.579
also probably say great men, like he did, for

420
00:21:22.579 --> 00:21:25.180
instance, with Wagner back when he was young, right?

421
00:21:25.300 --> 00:21:30.869
Um. Because They might not be so great in

422
00:21:30.869 --> 00:21:32.910
the end, right? And you are, you are yet

423
00:21:32.910 --> 00:21:35.469
not in the position to realize that and to

424
00:21:35.469 --> 00:21:39.109
know that. Um, SO you have to, you have

425
00:21:39.109 --> 00:21:43.550
to, uh, disengage your autonomous agency sometimes. You have

426
00:21:43.550 --> 00:21:46.349
to adopt the kind of fatalistic attitude of the

427
00:21:46.349 --> 00:21:49.660
sort, uh, perhaps Brian Leiter, uh, would, would like

428
00:21:49.660 --> 00:21:53.869
to, uh, recommend, namely, just be a cultural spectator

429
00:21:53.869 --> 00:21:56.140
of your life instead of being an active contributor

430
00:21:56.140 --> 00:21:58.989
to it, right? But you do all those things

431
00:21:58.989 --> 00:22:03.329
so that eventually you recover yourself and your agency

432
00:22:03.329 --> 00:22:06.469
and become who you are, presumably, right, which, by

433
00:22:06.469 --> 00:22:08.030
the way, if we go back to what I

434
00:22:08.030 --> 00:22:11.170
just told you about Wagner, right, Nietzsche in the,

435
00:22:11.510 --> 00:22:16.109
uh, Wagner meditation says Wagner looks into himself. He

436
00:22:16.109 --> 00:22:18.160
has a moment of introspection. He has a moment

437
00:22:18.160 --> 00:22:23.180
of self-awareness, of self-understanding, of self-knowledge. And that's how

438
00:22:23.180 --> 00:22:25.579
he became who he was, right? That's what Nietzsche

439
00:22:25.579 --> 00:22:27.369
tells us, or what he was and what he

440
00:22:27.369 --> 00:22:29.739
will be, what he will be for the, for

441
00:22:29.739 --> 00:22:36.160
the future, um. Involves, therefore, this kind of rationality,

442
00:22:36.239 --> 00:22:39.079
right? But what is it that you become when

443
00:22:39.079 --> 00:22:40.880
you become who you are? That's a big question,

444
00:22:40.959 --> 00:22:44.540
right? And, and of course, One of the things,

445
00:22:44.660 --> 00:22:49.339
uh, that comes out, if you look at, uh,

446
00:22:50.079 --> 00:22:52.119
if you trace the, the, the occurrence of this

447
00:22:52.119 --> 00:22:56.199
phrase, uh, throughout Nietzsche's work in the ways I've

448
00:22:56.199 --> 00:22:58.359
done, right, uh, in the gay science or in

449
00:22:58.359 --> 00:23:01.819
the, is that it's about becoming unique in some

450
00:23:01.819 --> 00:23:03.880
sense, right? Becoming the unique person you have it

451
00:23:03.880 --> 00:23:07.310
in you. To become, but what is this uniqueness

452
00:23:07.310 --> 00:23:12.829
exactly, right? Well, uh, in some sense, uh, we're

453
00:23:12.829 --> 00:23:16.589
all unique, right? Obviously, because we are, as Nietzsche

454
00:23:16.589 --> 00:23:19.630
says in the meditations, actually in the, uh, second

455
00:23:19.630 --> 00:23:24.699
meditation, no, sorry, 3rd meditation, Schopenhauer as educator, um.

456
00:23:25.160 --> 00:23:28.520
You know, no, you are born right now to

457
00:23:28.520 --> 00:23:31.400
this moment, to this era where you had whole

458
00:23:31.400 --> 00:23:35.069
eternities to have been born, right? And, uh, or,

459
00:23:35.160 --> 00:23:37.920
and, and, you know, whole eternities in the, in

460
00:23:37.920 --> 00:23:39.989
the future to have been born, but no, you're

461
00:23:39.989 --> 00:23:42.829
born right now. And it's because you're born right

462
00:23:42.829 --> 00:23:46.260
now that you have this kind of impulse to,

463
00:23:46.359 --> 00:23:48.900
and, and this demand placed on you to become

464
00:23:48.900 --> 00:23:51.160
the unique person you can have it in you

465
00:23:51.160 --> 00:23:55.469
to become, OK? Uh, THERE'S a sense of uniqueness

466
00:23:55.469 --> 00:23:58.339
there that, that, that is kind of familiar, each

467
00:23:58.339 --> 00:24:01.290
person is a, is, is, is an individual that,

468
00:24:01.449 --> 00:24:04.469
that is irrepeatable, right, that, that, that, that will

469
00:24:04.469 --> 00:24:09.290
never again. Uh, HERE, right? No, never again will

470
00:24:09.290 --> 00:24:11.130
there be a Ricardo Lopez. Never again will there

471
00:24:11.130 --> 00:24:13.530
be a Gabriel Zamos, right? It's kind of like

472
00:24:13.530 --> 00:24:15.569
we are unique in that sense, but that's not

473
00:24:15.569 --> 00:24:17.930
the sense of uniqueness that's at stake here, you

474
00:24:17.930 --> 00:24:20.530
see. It's not just that you're an individual self

475
00:24:20.530 --> 00:24:23.050
that is irrepeatable, that is completely different from other

476
00:24:23.050 --> 00:24:25.890
selves and all that stuff. It's not identi identity

477
00:24:25.890 --> 00:24:28.170
uniqueness or anything like that that's at stake. I

478
00:24:28.170 --> 00:24:31.040
think for Nietzsche, what's at stake is And here

479
00:24:31.040 --> 00:24:34.150
we maybe start to drift into the other ideals,

480
00:24:34.280 --> 00:24:37.180
right? What, what's at stake is the realizing this.

481
00:24:38.030 --> 00:24:41.550
Productive uniqueness that is possible for you that has

482
00:24:41.550 --> 00:24:45.790
to be linked to. Well, broader issues, which are

483
00:24:45.790 --> 00:24:47.949
the issues that Nietzsche really is interested in. Going

484
00:24:47.949 --> 00:24:50.040
back to the issue of, you know, we miss

485
00:24:50.040 --> 00:24:53.160
Nietzsche's philosophy for the trees, right? We, we meet,

486
00:24:53.439 --> 00:24:57.280
we're, we're interested in this insular problems of free

487
00:24:57.280 --> 00:24:59.310
will and whatever, and we missed that what Nietzsche's

488
00:24:59.310 --> 00:25:01.599
philosophy is interested in is not the insular problem

489
00:25:01.599 --> 00:25:05.770
of free will or whatever, but rather, Human flourishing

490
00:25:05.770 --> 00:25:09.010
and like culture and society and how do we

491
00:25:09.010 --> 00:25:12.569
ennoble cultures and societies and the human beings that

492
00:25:12.569 --> 00:25:15.930
live in them, right? That's really the project that

493
00:25:15.930 --> 00:25:18.010
Nietzsche has in mind. It's a moral and political

494
00:25:18.010 --> 00:25:20.689
project to some extent and everything he does in

495
00:25:20.689 --> 00:25:22.920
his philosophy is in the service of that really,

496
00:25:23.089 --> 00:25:27.089
OK? So, so, so the, so the issue then

497
00:25:27.089 --> 00:25:30.989
is about how we connect back to those. Topics,

498
00:25:31.369 --> 00:25:34.260
whatever it is we're doing in this, you know,

499
00:25:34.339 --> 00:25:36.939
in these trees that we're interested in analyzing whether

500
00:25:36.939 --> 00:25:40.180
it's the metaphysics, the, the moral psychology, or what

501
00:25:40.180 --> 00:25:42.020
have you, I think that's one of the issues.

502
00:25:42.060 --> 00:25:44.739
Maybe I should pause a little to, to get

503
00:25:44.739 --> 00:25:46.050
you to because otherwise I'll keep forever.

504
00:25:48.560 --> 00:25:51.140
No, yeah, I, I was just thinking you've already,

505
00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:55.150
yeah, you, you've already talked a little bit about

506
00:25:55.150 --> 00:25:58.479
uniqueness. So let me ask you, if becoming what

507
00:25:58.479 --> 00:26:03.800
one is involves active self-reflection, as you mentioned there,

508
00:26:03.959 --> 00:26:07.000
how do you square that off with Nietzsche's takes

509
00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:11.880
on drives and his seemingly deterministic take on

510
00:26:11.880 --> 00:26:15.339
free will? Yeah, so. I mean, this is a

511
00:26:15.339 --> 00:26:18.390
complicated issue and, and, and I'm gonna introduce another

512
00:26:18.390 --> 00:26:20.750
caveat, which is I'm probably gonna disappoint you and

513
00:26:20.750 --> 00:26:23.339
your audience here because I'm not gonna have a

514
00:26:23.339 --> 00:26:25.989
perfect answer for you or a, or a, or

515
00:26:25.989 --> 00:26:29.229
a really good answer for you. Um, BUT, I

516
00:26:29.229 --> 00:26:34.130
mean, Let me see, how can I, uh, tackle

517
00:26:34.130 --> 00:26:36.589
the, the issue. The, the first thing to say,

518
00:26:37.089 --> 00:26:40.770
um, probably is, look, this is a, this is

519
00:26:40.770 --> 00:26:45.050
a metaphysical issue. This is the metaphysical issue of

520
00:26:45.050 --> 00:26:48.729
the free will debate, OK? Basically, which is If

521
00:26:48.729 --> 00:26:50.650
I describe the human being, if I have a

522
00:26:50.650 --> 00:26:53.040
moral psychology that describes the human being as being

523
00:26:53.040 --> 00:26:57.050
reduct in a reductivist way, as having a compartment

524
00:26:57.050 --> 00:26:59.890
that reduces ultimately to whatever you want to, to

525
00:26:59.890 --> 00:27:03.359
say, drives or, you know, desires or, or, uh,

526
00:27:03.410 --> 00:27:06.819
you know, quantum. Uh, DOING better things in, in

527
00:27:06.819 --> 00:27:09.650
your brain. OK, whatever the hell it is, right?

528
00:27:09.900 --> 00:27:12.510
You have a moral psychology that ultimately is reductivist

529
00:27:12.510 --> 00:27:16.099
and that is deterministic, yeah, that says the, the

530
00:27:16.099 --> 00:27:19.439
relationships of these things occurring in your mental life,

531
00:27:19.699 --> 00:27:25.290
um, are neces necessary, they're necessitated to occur because

532
00:27:25.300 --> 00:27:27.500
of other stuff that's going on, whether it's quanta,

533
00:27:27.569 --> 00:27:31.310
whether it's stripes, whether it's whatever it is. And

534
00:27:31.310 --> 00:27:36.140
then you have a philosopher that is. Saying, hey,

535
00:27:36.260 --> 00:27:38.300
hold, hold on a second, you contribute to your

536
00:27:38.300 --> 00:27:41.219
life by being by doing self-reflection and doing. Now

537
00:27:41.219 --> 00:27:42.780
you have a problem because you're like, wait a

538
00:27:42.780 --> 00:27:44.859
second. You're telling me there is some kind of

539
00:27:44.859 --> 00:27:47.579
agency that I have in my life, and yet

540
00:27:47.579 --> 00:27:51.349
this moral psychology is, is reductivistic and telling me

541
00:27:51.349 --> 00:27:53.660
that the nes that, that, that my, my life,

542
00:27:53.739 --> 00:27:57.099
my actions and everything is basically governed by necessary

543
00:27:57.099 --> 00:28:00.250
processes that are outside of my control, right? That

544
00:28:00.250 --> 00:28:02.300
are not really under my control. How do I

545
00:28:02.300 --> 00:28:05.819
square that circle, right? OK, yeah, that's the metaphysical

546
00:28:05.819 --> 00:28:07.699
problem of free will. It's, it's presented as a

547
00:28:07.699 --> 00:28:11.030
problem of a dilemma argument. If the, if the

548
00:28:11.349 --> 00:28:14.349
If the world is deterministic, right, as my science

549
00:28:14.349 --> 00:28:17.369
seems to tell me, it's a world of causal

550
00:28:17.369 --> 00:28:21.829
connections where things have causal relationships that necessitate their

551
00:28:21.829 --> 00:28:24.829
occurrence, then I couldn't have done otherwise. Then I

552
00:28:24.829 --> 00:28:27.829
can't be spontaneous in my actions. There, the, I

553
00:28:27.829 --> 00:28:30.670
can't have spontaneity in my choices, free will, which

554
00:28:30.670 --> 00:28:34.949
is spontaneity in my choices, uh, the capacity to

555
00:28:34.949 --> 00:28:36.910
do otherwise, we probably have to talk a little

556
00:28:36.910 --> 00:28:40.459
bit more about. Uh, WHAT typically we understand free

557
00:28:40.459 --> 00:28:42.819
will to mean, OK? Uh, MAYBE we'll get to

558
00:28:42.819 --> 00:28:44.969
that when we get to some individual, we'll see,

559
00:28:45.260 --> 00:28:50.150
but, uh, you, you know, this, this capacity is

560
00:28:50.150 --> 00:28:53.219
in conflict with this picture. What, ah, how do

561
00:28:53.219 --> 00:28:55.260
I square the circle? Now, there are ways we

562
00:28:55.260 --> 00:28:58.060
can square the circle, right? We could square the

563
00:28:58.060 --> 00:28:59.660
circle in this debate, for instance, by taking the

564
00:28:59.660 --> 00:29:02.180
compatible list route. And this is in fact something

565
00:29:02.180 --> 00:29:05.170
that many people in the Nietzsche tradition. Uh, OR

566
00:29:05.170 --> 00:29:07.150
who are working in the Nietzsche tradition, what Nietzsche

567
00:29:07.150 --> 00:29:09.890
scholars try to do, right? So, they, they notice

568
00:29:10.209 --> 00:29:13.930
that Nietzsche seems to talk positively about, about freedom

569
00:29:13.930 --> 00:29:17.290
and seems to even talk about freedom as, uh,

570
00:29:17.369 --> 00:29:21.439
you know, involved with, with processes of self-reflection, self-knowledge,

571
00:29:21.489 --> 00:29:23.569
and all that stuff. They are willing to acknowledge

572
00:29:23.569 --> 00:29:27.589
all that. But since they also acknowledge that Nietzsche

573
00:29:27.589 --> 00:29:31.750
has a moral psychology, apparently that is deterministic in

574
00:29:31.750 --> 00:29:34.949
these ways, they say the solution is Nietzsche must

575
00:29:34.949 --> 00:29:38.670
have been a compatibilist about free will. OK, that's

576
00:29:38.670 --> 00:29:42.199
the solution. So let's go compatibly. Now notice, we're

577
00:29:42.199 --> 00:29:45.069
doing precisely what I said. We're in danger of

578
00:29:45.069 --> 00:29:47.790
doing. We're bringing in a, a, a, a concern

579
00:29:47.790 --> 00:29:50.670
we have, which is a debate about free will.

580
00:29:50.790 --> 00:29:52.430
I'm really interested in this debate. I wanna know

581
00:29:52.430 --> 00:29:54.619
if I am free, OK, or not. I wanna

582
00:29:54.619 --> 00:29:56.670
know what the nature of reality is and whether

583
00:29:56.670 --> 00:29:59.540
this nature of reality includes beings that are free

584
00:29:59.540 --> 00:30:01.569
and therefore me as a being that is free.

585
00:30:01.719 --> 00:30:04.189
That's what I'm really concerned about or something like

586
00:30:04.189 --> 00:30:07.069
that. And I want Nietzsche to answer, right? What

587
00:30:07.069 --> 00:30:11.670
does he believe, right, about this debate. I'm forcing

588
00:30:11.670 --> 00:30:13.930
Nietzsche to give me this answer, and I'm gonna

589
00:30:14.390 --> 00:30:19.849
notice. BE disposed in certain directions if I'm disposed

590
00:30:19.849 --> 00:30:23.770
to acknowledge that N Nietzsche speaks positively about freedom

591
00:30:23.930 --> 00:30:26.130
and that he also has a moral psychology that

592
00:30:26.130 --> 00:30:29.630
seems deterministic and all that stuff. So I'm gonna

593
00:30:29.630 --> 00:30:33.589
be naturally gravitating towards saying Nietzsche must answer this

594
00:30:33.589 --> 00:30:36.709
way, he must be a compatibleist of some sort,

595
00:30:36.790 --> 00:30:41.270
of some variety, right? Um, EVEN if I have,

596
00:30:41.390 --> 00:30:46.270
even if I'm having, you know, uh. Even if

597
00:30:46.270 --> 00:30:49.459
I'm trying to develop theories that are outside the

598
00:30:49.459 --> 00:30:51.869
traditional ways in which you think of compatibilityism. So,

599
00:30:51.949 --> 00:30:54.189
for instance, some Nietzsche scholars try to develop the

600
00:30:54.189 --> 00:30:58.949
expressivist notion of, of, uh, Nietzsche's uh agency. So,

601
00:30:59.180 --> 00:31:04.869
your agents express their Uh, their being or something

602
00:31:04.869 --> 00:31:08.069
like that in their actions, um, but when you

603
00:31:08.069 --> 00:31:13.719
explore what this expressivist meaning of is expressing, expressivist,

604
00:31:13.790 --> 00:31:18.270
uh, uh, theory is saying exactly, well, it's a

605
00:31:18.270 --> 00:31:21.324
kind of variation of. A compatibleist notion of things

606
00:31:21.324 --> 00:31:24.204
where you express things in a world that is

607
00:31:24.204 --> 00:31:26.734
deterministic and all that stuff and so, yeah, you're

608
00:31:26.734 --> 00:31:29.484
expressive, your expressions and the and the way you

609
00:31:29.484 --> 00:31:31.675
are, you are in your actions is kind of

610
00:31:31.675 --> 00:31:35.125
dictated by forces that are, you know, deterministic forces

611
00:31:35.125 --> 00:31:37.444
that it's in, in many ways are outside of

612
00:31:37.444 --> 00:31:40.685
your control, that's it. OK, so we get this

613
00:31:40.685 --> 00:31:43.444
tendency, but is that the way Nietzsche talks about

614
00:31:43.444 --> 00:31:46.969
freedom when he's positively talking about freedom. Have we

615
00:31:46.969 --> 00:31:49.729
asked that question? No, we haven't. We kind of

616
00:31:49.729 --> 00:31:56.209
like been blindly already. Predisposed to the answer Nietzsche

617
00:31:56.209 --> 00:31:58.589
must, when he talks in the genealogy about freedom,

618
00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:00.930
uh, in the positive way he does when he

619
00:32:00.930 --> 00:32:03.010
calls the sovereign individual a master of a free

620
00:32:03.010 --> 00:32:05.640
will, it must be free will in this compatible

621
00:32:05.640 --> 00:32:09.959
sense because otherwise we have a contradiction, right? And

622
00:32:09.959 --> 00:32:14.250
Nietzsche contradicting himself? What? OK, that, that, no, we

623
00:32:14.250 --> 00:32:18.400
are after truth. Right? Truth is, cannot be contradictory,

624
00:32:18.489 --> 00:32:20.400
first of all, right? We have a conception of

625
00:32:20.400 --> 00:32:22.640
what truth must be like. Truth is such that

626
00:32:22.640 --> 00:32:24.959
the collection of all true facts cannot contradict each

627
00:32:24.959 --> 00:32:28.800
other, OK? Uh, FOR instance, right? So, we, we

628
00:32:28.800 --> 00:32:31.000
got to iron out these contradictions. We gotta get

629
00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:34.510
rid of them, OK? But then go look at

630
00:32:34.510 --> 00:32:38.189
the genealogy. Uh, IF you look at the genealogy

631
00:32:38.189 --> 00:32:41.150
quick carefully, I, I submit to you that the

632
00:32:41.150 --> 00:32:44.089
conception of freedom that Nietzsche's trafficking within the genealogy

633
00:32:44.270 --> 00:32:47.469
is not a compatible conception of freedom. The things

634
00:32:47.469 --> 00:32:50.619
he, he speaks about in the genealogy are spontaneity,

635
00:32:50.709 --> 00:32:55.209
good and evil, OK? He speaks about I could

636
00:32:55.209 --> 00:32:57.880
have done otherwise, right? Coming to realize that I

637
00:32:57.880 --> 00:33:00.050
could have done otherwise. These are the two basic

638
00:33:00.050 --> 00:33:03.890
conceptions of what it means to be free to

639
00:33:03.890 --> 00:33:09.930
the ordinary person, right? Ordinary people believe. Ordinarily we

640
00:33:09.930 --> 00:33:12.430
believe to be free means, I am in charge

641
00:33:12.430 --> 00:33:15.869
of my behavior because I'm, I can spontaneously begin

642
00:33:15.869 --> 00:33:19.150
a causal series, right? I can spontaneously inject myself

643
00:33:19.150 --> 00:33:22.050
into the world and do either A or B.

644
00:33:22.229 --> 00:33:24.390
I can be spontaneous in good and in evil,

645
00:33:24.430 --> 00:33:27.310
as Nietzsche says in when he says the, the

646
00:33:27.310 --> 00:33:29.270
Greeks, well, he doesn't say, I don't remember if

647
00:33:29.270 --> 00:33:31.349
he says the Greeks, but he says, you know,

648
00:33:31.510 --> 00:33:34.910
uh, the, the philosophers invented the concept of free

649
00:33:34.910 --> 00:33:38.520
will in order to keep the gods. Uh, YOU

650
00:33:38.520 --> 00:33:41.680
know, interested in us, right? Uh, A, a wholly

651
00:33:41.680 --> 00:33:45.239
deterministic world would not have been an interesting world

652
00:33:45.239 --> 00:33:48.319
for the gods. So, what is this concept of

653
00:33:48.319 --> 00:33:50.079
free will that they invented? It's the concept of

654
00:33:50.079 --> 00:33:53.199
spontaneity, good and evil, and the concept of basically

655
00:33:53.199 --> 00:33:55.439
that, that, that the humans could have done otherwise,

656
00:33:55.520 --> 00:33:59.280
right? They could have acted differently. That's the libertarian

657
00:33:59.280 --> 00:34:02.239
concept of free will. That's not the compatibleist notions.

658
00:34:02.479 --> 00:34:07.900
Notice the, the explicit language about Not deterministic world,

659
00:34:08.159 --> 00:34:10.719
right? He, he kind of says that. The deterministic

660
00:34:10.719 --> 00:34:13.280
world would have been a boring world because then

661
00:34:13.280 --> 00:34:18.438
these, these, these creatures are just Passive spectators of

662
00:34:18.438 --> 00:34:22.620
life, they're just muppets, right? Being manipulated by things

663
00:34:22.620 --> 00:34:25.270
beyond their control. That's not interesting to a god.

664
00:34:25.469 --> 00:34:28.070
What's interesting to a god is in the Iliad,

665
00:34:28.188 --> 00:34:31.188
I want, you know, uh, uh, Hector to win.

666
00:34:31.350 --> 00:34:34.708
Oh, but this Achilles does some things spontaneously that

667
00:34:34.708 --> 00:34:37.110
mess up all my plans, OK, so it's like,

668
00:34:37.149 --> 00:34:40.379
oh, you know. Because notice the, also the, the

669
00:34:40.379 --> 00:34:42.780
idea, the, the interest in the gods. So this

670
00:34:42.780 --> 00:34:44.879
is not the invention, this is something that many,

671
00:34:45.139 --> 00:34:47.668
I think, uh, scholars miss, right? They tend to,

672
00:34:47.860 --> 00:34:49.860
to think that Nietzsche thinks that the invention of

673
00:34:49.860 --> 00:34:52.938
libertarian free will is an invention of Christianity. No,

674
00:34:53.060 --> 00:34:54.860
the invention of libertarian free will is the, it's

675
00:34:54.860 --> 00:34:57.699
a prehistoric invention of people who believed in many

676
00:34:57.699 --> 00:34:59.820
gods. I don't know if it's the Greeks, but

677
00:34:59.820 --> 00:35:02.679
it's anybody. In fact, I think it's anybody because

678
00:35:02.939 --> 00:35:06.060
the genealogy is tracing the, the ways in which

679
00:35:06.060 --> 00:35:08.620
we became the animals that we are. And what

680
00:35:08.620 --> 00:35:10.409
are these animals? There are some animals that are

681
00:35:10.409 --> 00:35:12.340
moral, and what is one of the most important

682
00:35:12.340 --> 00:35:15.659
moral categories we animals use, we human animals use

683
00:35:15.659 --> 00:35:18.139
today? It's a category of free will. Compatible is

684
00:35:18.139 --> 00:35:20.540
free will. No, compatible with free will is a

685
00:35:20.540 --> 00:35:22.659
free will that only philosophers can come up with,

686
00:35:22.860 --> 00:35:25.820
OK? When they start to realize that. There is

687
00:35:25.820 --> 00:35:30.149
incompatibility between being free in this spontaneous, you know,

688
00:35:30.469 --> 00:35:32.899
I could have done otherwise way and what my

689
00:35:32.899 --> 00:35:34.629
science is telling me my world is like, which

690
00:35:34.629 --> 00:35:37.310
is causally determined and all that stuff, so I

691
00:35:37.310 --> 00:35:39.919
must come up with a different definition of freedom,

692
00:35:40.270 --> 00:35:43.979
one that is gonna make these things compatible, right?

693
00:35:44.350 --> 00:35:46.530
And they do a good job of telling us,

694
00:35:46.750 --> 00:35:51.540
uh, you know. Look, freedom is about non-coercion. It's

695
00:35:51.540 --> 00:35:54.699
not about not being caused or causally determined to

696
00:35:54.699 --> 00:35:56.540
act in the ways that you are causally determined

697
00:35:56.540 --> 00:35:59.800
to act. Uh, BUT they do a terrible job

698
00:36:00.139 --> 00:36:03.010
of convincing us that what we mean by I

699
00:36:03.010 --> 00:36:06.780
could have done otherwise is It's just logically possible

700
00:36:06.780 --> 00:36:09.090
that if the universe had been different, I, my

701
00:36:09.090 --> 00:36:12.020
action would have been a different action, right? That's

702
00:36:12.020 --> 00:36:15.580
not what we ordinarily understand ourselves uh to be

703
00:36:15.580 --> 00:36:17.580
saying when we say I could have done otherwise.

704
00:36:17.780 --> 00:36:19.899
When we say I could have done otherwise, what

705
00:36:19.899 --> 00:36:22.179
we mean is, I was spontaneous in good and

706
00:36:22.179 --> 00:36:24.020
evil, and if I did the evil thing, guess

707
00:36:24.020 --> 00:36:26.739
what? I could have succeeded at doing the not

708
00:36:26.739 --> 00:36:29.020
evil thing, OK? And that's why I feel bad

709
00:36:29.020 --> 00:36:31.979
about myself, partly, right? Because I understand myself to

710
00:36:31.979 --> 00:36:35.300
be a morally responsible agent that has libertarian free

711
00:36:35.300 --> 00:36:36.739
will, if you wish to put it that way,

712
00:36:36.860 --> 00:36:38.540
right? The, the, the sort of free will that

713
00:36:38.540 --> 00:36:42.350
doesn't seem quite compatible. So, And that's the free

714
00:36:42.350 --> 00:36:44.899
will that the master, that the sovereign is a

715
00:36:44.899 --> 00:36:47.830
master over. I think he's a master over, if

716
00:36:47.830 --> 00:36:51.060
you're careful in the analysis of the genealogy, you'll

717
00:36:51.060 --> 00:36:53.989
find out that the, the mastery the sovereign individual

718
00:36:53.989 --> 00:36:56.550
has over free will is over the libertarian free

719
00:36:56.550 --> 00:36:58.550
will, over the concept of free will that we

720
00:36:58.550 --> 00:37:02.729
humans have been bred to understand ourselves to have

721
00:37:03.080 --> 00:37:06.189
through these historical processes that N Nietzsche is retracing.

722
00:37:06.669 --> 00:37:08.949
So, let's go back to your problem, the squaring

723
00:37:08.949 --> 00:37:11.510
these things. How do we square them? Well, let

724
00:37:11.510 --> 00:37:13.110
me now pause and say, hold on a second.

725
00:37:13.389 --> 00:37:16.649
Remember, you're trying to foist this problem of squaring

726
00:37:16.649 --> 00:37:22.340
the circle here, um, Because For us, there is

727
00:37:22.340 --> 00:37:25.379
a contradiction that needs resolving in the free will

728
00:37:25.379 --> 00:37:28.399
debate. But is Nietzsche interested in the free will

729
00:37:28.399 --> 00:37:30.439
debate in this way? Maybe not. And so he's

730
00:37:30.439 --> 00:37:34.080
perfectly fine with contradicting himself, with maybe giving you

731
00:37:34.080 --> 00:37:37.360
a moral psychology that sounds very deterministic, and, you

732
00:37:37.360 --> 00:37:40.560
know, that ultimately reduces everything to drugs. And then

733
00:37:40.560 --> 00:37:42.760
when he's interested in his ideals about how are

734
00:37:42.760 --> 00:37:45.879
we going to become flourishing animals and all that

735
00:37:45.879 --> 00:37:47.919
stuff, let's talk about free will and becoming a

736
00:37:47.919 --> 00:37:50.800
master of a free will, understood in a libertarian

737
00:37:50.800 --> 00:37:54.120
sense, not in a compatible sense, right? Understood as

738
00:37:54.120 --> 00:37:56.719
the master of a, of a cre a creature

739
00:37:56.719 --> 00:38:00.639
that has mastered the understanding, he has of himself

740
00:38:00.639 --> 00:38:03.919
as a creature that is spontaneous in his actions

741
00:38:03.919 --> 00:38:09.060
and can initiate causal series spontaneously and that knows

742
00:38:09.060 --> 00:38:11.040
himself to be able to do otherwise so that

743
00:38:11.040 --> 00:38:14.000
he feels bad if he does something that then

744
00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:16.659
he regrets, right, or he, or he has remorse

745
00:38:16.919 --> 00:38:21.280
for, um, etc. I think that's, that's maybe what

746
00:38:21.280 --> 00:38:24.030
we should do. Now, of course. This would mean,

747
00:38:24.159 --> 00:38:26.560
well, Nietzsche's contradicting himself. Why would he do that,

748
00:38:26.639 --> 00:38:29.899
right? I mean, it shouldn't we be after truth?

749
00:38:29.989 --> 00:38:32.959
Shouldn't we be trying to uh figure out what

750
00:38:32.959 --> 00:38:35.080
the truth is? This gets us into a very

751
00:38:35.080 --> 00:38:38.159
complicated debate because this has to do now with

752
00:38:38.159 --> 00:38:41.550
the debate about truth and falsehood and whether Nietzsche,

753
00:38:41.560 --> 00:38:45.800
for instance, embraces a falsification theory about all of

754
00:38:45.800 --> 00:38:48.000
the, you know, a meta, which is a metaphysical

755
00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:51.080
kind of claim and also epistemological but metaphysical claim

756
00:38:51.080 --> 00:38:54.370
about how we are condemned as the creatures that

757
00:38:54.370 --> 00:38:59.489
we are to misinterpret. The world, right, and to

758
00:38:59.489 --> 00:39:02.290
foist onto the world categories and concepts that are

759
00:39:02.290 --> 00:39:05.969
errors, that are mistakes, that are falsehoods, and we

760
00:39:05.969 --> 00:39:09.149
can't help but do that. Because of the evolutionary

761
00:39:09.149 --> 00:39:12.429
process through which life was formed. Life, even, even

762
00:39:12.429 --> 00:39:14.679
the amoeba, right? The amoeba was formed through an

763
00:39:14.679 --> 00:39:19.550
evolutionary process that incorporated errors into its formation. And

764
00:39:19.550 --> 00:39:21.949
then when you get to very complex beings like

765
00:39:21.949 --> 00:39:25.139
us, those errors have grown into other errors and

766
00:39:25.139 --> 00:39:27.790
have spurred other errors, and now we have errors

767
00:39:27.790 --> 00:39:30.810
everywhere, and we are a creature that has incorporated

768
00:39:31.070 --> 00:39:33.389
two errors because this is the other side that

769
00:39:33.389 --> 00:39:36.500
people don't. And, and forgive me for going over

770
00:39:36.500 --> 00:39:38.790
a little bit in my answer, but this is

771
00:39:38.790 --> 00:39:41.179
the other side that people often don't emphasize in

772
00:39:41.179 --> 00:39:44.459
this debate, namely that Nietzsche calls the concept of

773
00:39:44.459 --> 00:39:47.350
cause into question, right? Even in the, in the

774
00:39:47.350 --> 00:39:51.810
casa sui, um, A passage in Beyond Good and

775
00:39:51.810 --> 00:39:55.199
Evil, which is often used to, to say that

776
00:39:55.199 --> 00:39:58.149
Nietzsche rejects the libertarian notion of free will, right?

777
00:39:58.550 --> 00:40:01.320
Uh, ALTHOUGH, you know, uh, libertarian notion of free

778
00:40:01.320 --> 00:40:03.120
will is not necessarily the notion of a causa

779
00:40:03.120 --> 00:40:06.090
sui, right? The notion of being cause of yourself.

780
00:40:06.709 --> 00:40:11.709
Um, I, I think that's a, a mischaracterization in

781
00:40:11.709 --> 00:40:13.629
some ways. You don't have to necessarily think that

782
00:40:13.629 --> 00:40:14.989
you have to be a cause of yourself in

783
00:40:14.989 --> 00:40:16.810
order to believe that you can be a spontaneous

784
00:40:17.149 --> 00:40:20.459
initiator of causal series or that you have to,

785
00:40:20.550 --> 00:40:22.780
uh, or that you could have done otherwise, right?

786
00:40:22.939 --> 00:40:26.189
Uh. AND, and Nietzsche is in fact very clear

787
00:40:26.189 --> 00:40:31.820
that that's a superlative metaphysical notion, right? Um, THE,

788
00:40:31.949 --> 00:40:35.909
the, perhaps the libertarian, more traditional libertarian notions are

789
00:40:35.909 --> 00:40:39.429
not superlative, metaphysical, but only metaphysical, right? In a,

790
00:40:39.479 --> 00:40:42.149
in a more humble way or whatever, right? So,

791
00:40:42.709 --> 00:40:44.909
these are questions that are very complicated and that

792
00:40:44.909 --> 00:40:46.540
we, we, we need to go on, but just

793
00:40:46.540 --> 00:40:48.520
to get back to the point, in that passage,

794
00:40:49.189 --> 00:40:51.909
Nietzsche ends the passage by saying, the problem of

795
00:40:51.909 --> 00:40:54.429
free will, and there he's, he does seem to

796
00:40:54.429 --> 00:40:57.270
be referencing the traditional problem, the problem that we've

797
00:40:57.270 --> 00:41:00.340
been talking about, namely, How can I be free

798
00:41:00.340 --> 00:41:03.840
in a world that is wholly deterministic? HE says.

799
00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:10.330
That's a problem that It's profoundly personal. Right? It's

800
00:41:10.330 --> 00:41:16.659
a problem that betrays. The people who are involved

801
00:41:16.659 --> 00:41:19.360
in the debate, it betrays it in this way.

802
00:41:19.580 --> 00:41:22.100
The people who want to assert unfreedom of the

803
00:41:22.100 --> 00:41:25.780
will, cause psychological causal necessity, I think he even

804
00:41:25.780 --> 00:41:28.659
mentions in the passage, if I'm not misremembering, and

805
00:41:28.659 --> 00:41:32.100
all those things, they don't want to be responsible

806
00:41:32.100 --> 00:41:35.939
for anything. They want, they are, in fact, kind

807
00:41:35.939 --> 00:41:38.860
of, they feel guilty, they are sick of themselves,

808
00:41:38.979 --> 00:41:41.060
right? They know themselves to be guilty of things

809
00:41:41.060 --> 00:41:43.969
that they're sick of, and they, with this inner

810
00:41:43.969 --> 00:41:46.899
contempt that they have for themselves, they long to

811
00:41:46.899 --> 00:41:50.100
shift the blame for, for, for themselves, for what

812
00:41:50.100 --> 00:41:54.250
they are to somebody else. The other guys, the

813
00:41:54.250 --> 00:41:57.560
guys who affirm freedom in this libertarian sense, right,

814
00:41:57.850 --> 00:42:01.620
uh, they don't want to renounce the responsibility. They

815
00:42:01.620 --> 00:42:04.899
want to believe in them, they believe in themselves

816
00:42:04.899 --> 00:42:07.879
so strongly. Uh, I mean, uh, that they want

817
00:42:07.879 --> 00:42:11.729
to preserve their personal right. To be in control

818
00:42:11.729 --> 00:42:13.689
of their actions and, and to be the, the

819
00:42:13.689 --> 00:42:16.570
sole responsible causes of their behavior or something like

820
00:42:16.570 --> 00:42:22.649
that. Uh And, and he even says vain races

821
00:42:22.649 --> 00:42:25.790
belong in this category or something like that. Now,

822
00:42:27.260 --> 00:42:30.100
I ask you, in this, in this way of,

823
00:42:30.250 --> 00:42:34.010
of framing it, this personal way. Which is the

824
00:42:34.010 --> 00:42:36.919
noble way of doing, of, of feeling, and which

825
00:42:36.919 --> 00:42:40.199
is the slavish way of feeling? Well, we know

826
00:42:40.199 --> 00:42:42.040
from the genealogy and we know even from beyond

827
00:42:42.040 --> 00:42:44.719
good and evil in other places that the person

828
00:42:44.719 --> 00:42:48.000
who feels good about himself, who believes in himself,

829
00:42:48.080 --> 00:42:49.989
who has trust in himself, who all all those

830
00:42:49.989 --> 00:42:53.310
things, that's the noble. That would be on the

831
00:42:53.310 --> 00:42:56.429
free will side of the vain creatures who want

832
00:42:56.429 --> 00:42:59.870
to be responsible for everything, to assert libertarian free

833
00:42:59.870 --> 00:43:02.830
will. And who is the, the guy who doesn't

834
00:43:02.830 --> 00:43:04.620
want to be blamed for anything and wants to,

835
00:43:04.840 --> 00:43:08.179
uh, you know, renounce all responsibility and become just

836
00:43:08.429 --> 00:43:11.469
a causal arena for events and lay the blame

837
00:43:11.469 --> 00:43:14.189
of everything he does to his psychology or his,

838
00:43:14.429 --> 00:43:18.139
or his society or, or his, uh, whatever, right?

839
00:43:18.389 --> 00:43:21.879
Necessary forces that are working in him. That's the

840
00:43:21.879 --> 00:43:27.760
slave. So, one interesting thing about this is Even

841
00:43:27.760 --> 00:43:29.360
though N Nietzsche is not taking a a personal

842
00:43:29.360 --> 00:43:32.159
stand, and in fact, he tries to, to give

843
00:43:32.159 --> 00:43:34.199
you a different category. He tries to say, no,

844
00:43:34.439 --> 00:43:37.719
we shouldn't talk about free will and unfree will

845
00:43:37.719 --> 00:43:41.780
and deterministic will. We should talk about Strong will

846
00:43:41.780 --> 00:43:44.580
and weak will, right? That's what we should uh

847
00:43:44.580 --> 00:43:46.860
talk about, right? So he, he seems to be

848
00:43:46.860 --> 00:43:51.270
trying to Go away from this debate by introducing

849
00:43:51.270 --> 00:43:54.199
different categories or something like that, you know, uh,

850
00:43:54.409 --> 00:43:56.979
but it's interesting that in the debate, and for

851
00:43:56.979 --> 00:43:59.330
the people who are interested in the debate, he's

852
00:43:59.330 --> 00:44:02.050
also telling you something very interesting. He's telling you.

853
00:44:03.290 --> 00:44:06.239
The people who want to characterize the human being

854
00:44:06.239 --> 00:44:11.939
as Without free will, without libertarian free will, or

855
00:44:11.939 --> 00:44:14.100
with a free will that is not really libertarian

856
00:44:14.100 --> 00:44:16.939
free will, but it's just a, a deterministic free

857
00:44:16.939 --> 00:44:19.149
will, which is, you know, a free will where

858
00:44:19.149 --> 00:44:21.939
the agent is also not uh in control of

859
00:44:21.939 --> 00:44:24.459
his actions. Those people are slavish. They're under a

860
00:44:24.459 --> 00:44:29.459
slavish morality. And they betray a slavish morality. The

861
00:44:29.459 --> 00:44:32.320
other guys, at least they got this going for

862
00:44:32.320 --> 00:44:34.699
themselves, even if they are wrong too, OK, even

863
00:44:34.699 --> 00:44:40.780
if they're trafficking with errors. Those guys Are More

864
00:44:40.780 --> 00:44:43.419
noble because they, they believe in themselves, they want

865
00:44:43.419 --> 00:44:45.860
to keep believing in themselves and they are so

866
00:44:45.860 --> 00:44:48.620
proud and so vain in some ways that they

867
00:44:48.620 --> 00:44:51.860
want to not renounce their merit, right? See everything

868
00:44:51.860 --> 00:44:56.050
they do as their responsibility. It is also interesting

869
00:44:56.050 --> 00:44:58.679
that in this passage too, if I'm not misremembering,

870
00:44:59.050 --> 00:45:03.129
he says all these concepts freedom, causality, we have

871
00:45:03.129 --> 00:45:07.370
invented them. We humans. So this goes back to

872
00:45:07.370 --> 00:45:08.770
the issue I was telling you at the beginning.

873
00:45:08.969 --> 00:45:12.500
From a metaphysical point of view. It's hard to

874
00:45:12.500 --> 00:45:14.840
know what Nietzsche is saying, OK, first of all,

875
00:45:15.340 --> 00:45:17.899
what is the true metaphysics of the world, right?

876
00:45:18.260 --> 00:45:21.189
But And I don't know if we can really

877
00:45:21.189 --> 00:45:25.370
reconstruct Nietzsche's metaphysics in a successful way because I,

878
00:45:25.489 --> 00:45:28.070
I, I, I suspect, I haven't done it myself

879
00:45:28.070 --> 00:45:29.889
because I've been more interested in the ideals and

880
00:45:29.889 --> 00:45:32.699
all that stuff as, as I've been saying. But

881
00:45:32.699 --> 00:45:34.939
I suspect if we try to reconstruct what Nietzsche's

882
00:45:34.939 --> 00:45:37.020
true metaphysics are, we're gonna end up in a

883
00:45:37.020 --> 00:45:40.139
kind of very skeptical place, right? Where Nietzsche, Nietzsche

884
00:45:40.139 --> 00:45:42.100
is gonna say, look, I'm gonna, I'm gonna adopt

885
00:45:42.100 --> 00:45:46.189
the will to power hypothesis because scientific method demands

886
00:45:46.189 --> 00:45:49.725
it, right? And, you know, and because I, We

887
00:45:49.725 --> 00:45:52.485
should talk about will because we, we should postulate

888
00:45:52.485 --> 00:45:54.875
the will as being effective and efficient and all

889
00:45:54.875 --> 00:45:57.804
that stuff. And will can only move will, by

890
00:45:57.804 --> 00:45:59.594
the way, he, when he introduces that in Beyond

891
00:45:59.594 --> 00:46:01.245
Good and Evil, in that section in Beyond Good

892
00:46:01.245 --> 00:46:02.905
and Evil that he introduced the will to power

893
00:46:03.324 --> 00:46:05.125
in this way as the hypothesis that we need

894
00:46:05.125 --> 00:46:11.090
to uh adopt, um. He, he's gonna say, will

895
00:46:11.090 --> 00:46:13.729
can only move will. It cannot move muscles or

896
00:46:13.729 --> 00:46:16.489
matter or like other, that makes it sound like

897
00:46:16.489 --> 00:46:19.800
his metaphysics is a kind of panpsychic metaphysics, right?

898
00:46:20.090 --> 00:46:22.489
Going back to this mind-body problem uh that is

899
00:46:22.489 --> 00:46:25.010
a sub, it's a sub-problem of the free will

900
00:46:25.010 --> 00:46:26.689
debate or is it related also to the free

901
00:46:26.689 --> 00:46:28.199
will debate, this problem, how do you get a

902
00:46:28.199 --> 00:46:31.919
mind out of matter, right? Out of material, uh,

903
00:46:31.929 --> 00:46:34.179
things, uh, going in the, in the world, what

904
00:46:34.179 --> 00:46:38.989
physics tells us about. OK, um. He seems to

905
00:46:38.989 --> 00:46:42.189
be postulating some kind of panpsychism or, or something,

906
00:46:42.310 --> 00:46:45.229
right? Will, after all, is a mental category. So

907
00:46:45.229 --> 00:46:47.949
he's saying, will can only move will, so everything

908
00:46:47.949 --> 00:46:50.110
must be mental in some sense and be collections

909
00:46:50.110 --> 00:46:54.110
of wills, uh, will to power or something. Very

910
00:46:54.110 --> 00:46:57.110
strange metaphysics, but he also is careful to say

911
00:46:57.110 --> 00:46:59.310
it's just a hypothesis, right? It's just a, I'm

912
00:46:59.310 --> 00:47:02.669
not, I'm not actually necessarily saying this is exactly

913
00:47:02.669 --> 00:47:04.750
the way the world works and I have, I,

914
00:47:04.860 --> 00:47:07.429
here it is, the final metaphysics that's gonna reveal

915
00:47:07.429 --> 00:47:10.389
to us what nature is nakedly, right? Ah, I

916
00:47:10.389 --> 00:47:11.989
found it. I am a physicist. I'm the best

917
00:47:11.989 --> 00:47:15.030
physicist ever existed. No, he's not interested in that,

918
00:47:15.189 --> 00:47:18.600
right? He's postulating it for the service of his

919
00:47:18.600 --> 00:47:21.969
philosophy, which is about culture and whatever else. So,

920
00:47:22.020 --> 00:47:24.500
I suspect that when you try to interrogate Nietzsche

921
00:47:24.500 --> 00:47:29.229
metaphysically to the end, To the final consequence, what

922
00:47:29.229 --> 00:47:33.270
you bump into is Eitzche who is not fully

923
00:47:33.270 --> 00:47:37.909
convinced of whatever metaphysical claims he makes and who

924
00:47:37.909 --> 00:47:40.969
believes that metaphysically speaking, the world is quite opaque

925
00:47:41.340 --> 00:47:45.189
to us, OK, and that ultimately we're gonna bump

926
00:47:45.189 --> 00:47:51.590
into. Irresolvable. Unknowns and because we are going to

927
00:47:51.590 --> 00:47:57.439
bound. Up against irresolvable unknowns. This percolates all the

928
00:47:57.439 --> 00:47:59.889
way back to the metaphysical debates you're having about

929
00:47:59.889 --> 00:48:02.699
free will and not free will. Because if you

930
00:48:02.699 --> 00:48:06.139
cannot resolve the ultimate issue of what nature really

931
00:48:06.139 --> 00:48:09.560
is like, Then in some ways you can't really

932
00:48:09.560 --> 00:48:12.149
be sure that nature cannot contain a free will,

933
00:48:12.360 --> 00:48:16.610
right? Or, or that nature is purely deterministic or

934
00:48:16.610 --> 00:48:19.280
that determinism is not really compatible with even a

935
00:48:19.280 --> 00:48:22.040
libertarian notion of free will, because if there's a

936
00:48:22.040 --> 00:48:24.639
qualitaocultas at the very end of everything like the

937
00:48:24.639 --> 00:48:28.280
physicists in the, in the modern era, uh, started

938
00:48:28.280 --> 00:48:31.280
to see, and even Schopenhauer repeats this too, right?

939
00:48:31.439 --> 00:48:34.560
Schopenhauer, who influenced Nietzsche. Uh, WHEN he was young,

940
00:48:34.820 --> 00:48:37.739
repeats this too, right? When we interrogate the metaphysics

941
00:48:37.739 --> 00:48:39.459
of the world from the physical point of view

942
00:48:39.459 --> 00:48:43.090
of the phenomenal realm, right? Schopenhauer says, we always

943
00:48:43.090 --> 00:48:46.699
end up in this occult quality, right? And nobody

944
00:48:46.699 --> 00:48:51.610
can understand and nobody can really Say anything about.

945
00:48:52.100 --> 00:48:53.979
Well, if we end in an occult quality in

946
00:48:53.979 --> 00:48:56.260
an opaque place where the, where the where the

947
00:48:56.260 --> 00:48:59.899
shine, where the light of reason cannot shine, how

948
00:48:59.899 --> 00:49:02.580
can we be sure that there can be no

949
00:49:02.580 --> 00:49:05.979
free will, for instance, even if when we shine

950
00:49:05.979 --> 00:49:07.419
the light in the other parts that are not

951
00:49:07.419 --> 00:49:11.520
opaque, we see determinism going on. Yeah, you see

952
00:49:11.520 --> 00:49:13.080
what I mean. So this is part of the

953
00:49:13.080 --> 00:49:15.959
reason why I don't think Nietzsche. And we, and

954
00:49:15.959 --> 00:49:17.530
we do a kind of disservice a little bit

955
00:49:17.530 --> 00:49:19.360
to Nietzsche when we try to get him to

956
00:49:19.360 --> 00:49:22.639
answer, right? We, you need to tell me, are

957
00:49:22.639 --> 00:49:25.360
you for libertarian free will to court, and does

958
00:49:25.360 --> 00:49:27.760
that mean you reject all your moral psychology stuff

959
00:49:27.760 --> 00:49:33.489
about like, you know, or not? Yeah, now this

960
00:49:33.489 --> 00:49:38.169
does make Nietzsche's philosophy contradictory. There are other contradictions.

961
00:49:38.219 --> 00:49:40.179
I mean, uh, uh, I just mentioned the will

962
00:49:40.179 --> 00:49:42.840
to power to you, right? And where he says

963
00:49:43.260 --> 00:49:44.969
in that section in Beyond Good and Evil. I,

964
00:49:45.060 --> 00:49:46.689
I think Beyond Good and Evil, I'm bad, I'm

965
00:49:46.689 --> 00:49:48.100
very bad with dates too, but I think it

966
00:49:48.100 --> 00:49:50.939
was published in 1986 or something like that, um,

967
00:49:51.050 --> 00:49:56.520
1886, and, uh. Uh, THERE he's saying, the will,

968
00:49:56.649 --> 00:49:58.239
we must postulate the will to power as the,

969
00:49:58.370 --> 00:50:01.729
as the principle that everything reduces to, OK? Or

970
00:50:01.729 --> 00:50:04.790
the, or the thing that everything reduces to. Because,

971
00:50:05.500 --> 00:50:09.639
and we must postulate it. Because by by thinking

972
00:50:09.639 --> 00:50:11.689
that will is efficacious, and it can only be

973
00:50:11.689 --> 00:50:17.969
efficacious against other wills. Two years later, 1888, in

974
00:50:17.969 --> 00:50:20.689
Twilight of the Idols, he's gonna say, the will

975
00:50:20.689 --> 00:50:23.489
is an error, it means nothing, it moves nothing.

976
00:50:23.649 --> 00:50:25.790
It's not efficacious at all, it's just a word.

977
00:50:26.449 --> 00:50:30.469
It accompanies events, it could be absent. What? That's

978
00:50:30.469 --> 00:50:35.500
it, I mean. Outright contradiction, right? 2 years earlier

979
00:50:35.500 --> 00:50:38.260
you were telling me will is efficacious. 2 years

980
00:50:38.260 --> 00:50:41.580
later you're telling me. The will is not efficacious.

981
00:50:41.659 --> 00:50:43.100
Which one is it? Are you changing your mind

982
00:50:43.100 --> 00:50:45.860
every 2 seconds or every 2 years? Like what's

983
00:50:45.860 --> 00:50:48.580
going on? OK, I think this is the wrong

984
00:50:48.580 --> 00:50:52.840
approach because What we're missing is all my claims,

985
00:50:52.939 --> 00:50:55.409
they're in a particular context. When I make claims

986
00:50:55.409 --> 00:50:57.449
about the will not being efficacious, they're in a

987
00:50:57.449 --> 00:51:00.770
particular context, uh, uh talking about certain things. And

988
00:51:00.770 --> 00:51:04.580
moreover, in a particular book with particular intentions. The

989
00:51:04.580 --> 00:51:06.459
book has a particular intention. Nietzsche is one of

990
00:51:06.459 --> 00:51:10.899
the most intentional writers that exist, OK? This is

991
00:51:10.899 --> 00:51:12.489
one of the things that is so attractive about

992
00:51:12.489 --> 00:51:15.080
Nietzsche, I think, and so seductive about Nietzsche, his

993
00:51:15.080 --> 00:51:19.020
supreme eloquence. He's a fantastic writer, OK? He, he

994
00:51:19.020 --> 00:51:21.989
writes so eloquently that it moves you almost in

995
00:51:21.989 --> 00:51:26.409
every page. But he's also super intentional. You get

996
00:51:26.409 --> 00:51:29.649
the impression that every word is there for a

997
00:51:29.649 --> 00:51:34.370
reason, every comma, every, you know, dash, everything has

998
00:51:34.370 --> 00:51:37.870
meaning, OK? It's not there superfluously. It's not just

999
00:51:37.929 --> 00:51:40.409
a decoration. It's not just a way of like,

1000
00:51:40.469 --> 00:51:46.290
uh, you know, rhetoric flourish. No, it's intentional. When

1001
00:51:46.290 --> 00:51:49.489
he says the story individual is a master of

1002
00:51:49.489 --> 00:51:52.199
a free will. There's a reason he said master.

1003
00:51:52.469 --> 00:51:55.949
OK. There's, instead of saying, I don't know anything

1004
00:51:55.949 --> 00:51:58.750
else, you know, the certain individual has the capacity

1005
00:51:58.750 --> 00:52:00.629
for free will or, you know, uses his free

1006
00:52:00.629 --> 00:52:02.389
will a lot, or, you know, no, no, he

1007
00:52:02.389 --> 00:52:05.989
said master. Why master? He's recalling the master from

1008
00:52:05.989 --> 00:52:10.020
the first treaties. OK. This is another spontaneity, the

1009
00:52:10.020 --> 00:52:11.429
master in the first treatise, by the way, he

1010
00:52:11.429 --> 00:52:15.429
was described as being spontaneous, spontaneous in, in his

1011
00:52:15.429 --> 00:52:18.469
action, unconsciously spontaneous, because he's a beast of prey.

1012
00:52:18.550 --> 00:52:22.969
He's an animal. OK. Um, Now we have another

1013
00:52:22.969 --> 00:52:25.409
master. Is this master an animal that acts spontaneously,

1014
00:52:25.449 --> 00:52:28.290
unconsciously, and all that stuff? No. This is a

1015
00:52:28.290 --> 00:52:29.969
master that has, it's at the end of a

1016
00:52:29.969 --> 00:52:35.409
long process of actually breeding reflectivity and spirit into

1017
00:52:35.409 --> 00:52:39.050
the human animal, OK? Making this animal be more

1018
00:52:39.050 --> 00:52:42.969
reflective, be more rational, be more conscious of itself,

1019
00:52:43.330 --> 00:52:46.760
OK, in, in all sorts of ways. So, when

1020
00:52:46.760 --> 00:52:48.870
you are recalling the master in the, in the

1021
00:52:48.870 --> 00:52:52.520
sovereign individual, you're, you're trying to bring in the

1022
00:52:52.520 --> 00:52:54.760
stuff in the first treaties and elevate it to

1023
00:52:54.760 --> 00:52:58.040
a new position, right? And give me a different

1024
00:52:58.040 --> 00:53:00.429
type of mastery, a different type of nobility now,

1025
00:53:00.760 --> 00:53:03.149
that is the one that we should be aiming

1026
00:53:03.149 --> 00:53:06.000
for because it's the one that's promised in this

1027
00:53:06.000 --> 00:53:09.520
huge labor of the morality that, that, of custom

1028
00:53:09.520 --> 00:53:12.080
and all that stuff that has led to us,

1029
00:53:12.239 --> 00:53:14.159
right? To us, the human beings of the present.

1030
00:53:14.669 --> 00:53:16.590
Anyways, I, I think I overextended myself. I don't

1031
00:53:16.590 --> 00:53:17.840
know, and I started to talk about other things

1032
00:53:17.840 --> 00:53:19.550
that I know you want to talk about. Yeah,

1033
00:53:19.669 --> 00:53:20.629
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,

1034
00:53:20.709 --> 00:53:22.870
I was going to say that we will also

1035
00:53:22.870 --> 00:53:26.610
get in a second into the ideal of sovereignty

1036
00:53:26.830 --> 00:53:29.189
because you've already got a little bit into it,

1037
00:53:29.270 --> 00:53:31.810
but let me just ask you one more question

1038
00:53:31.810 --> 00:53:35.364
about the ideal. BECOMING what one is. So what

1039
00:53:35.364 --> 00:53:39.965
are then the mechanisms through which you suggest we

1040
00:53:39.965 --> 00:53:43.485
can I think this ideal of of becoming what

1041
00:53:43.485 --> 00:53:44.074
one is?

1042
00:53:44.364 --> 00:53:48.784
Yeah, so, so again, the mechanism is self-reflection, self-consciousness,

1043
00:53:49.485 --> 00:53:54.165
self-knowledge, OK, self understanding. But with the, with the

1044
00:53:54.165 --> 00:53:57.145
proviso, at least in the way in which Nietzsche,

1045
00:53:58.004 --> 00:54:01.090
um. Tackles those issues in Ekehomo, right, which is

1046
00:54:01.090 --> 00:54:03.070
a very problematic book, by the way, I should

1047
00:54:03.399 --> 00:54:05.679
perhaps mention that a little bit because Ekehomo is

1048
00:54:05.679 --> 00:54:09.000
an autobiography, but it's not a traditional autobiography. It's

1049
00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:12.239
a kind of parody of an autobiography. N Nietzsche

1050
00:54:12.239 --> 00:54:15.399
is lying throughout Ekehomo all the time, right? I

1051
00:54:15.399 --> 00:54:17.510
mean, he's saying things that are outrageous, right? Like

1052
00:54:17.510 --> 00:54:20.762
he never, he never had any religious. He doesn't

1053
00:54:20.762 --> 00:54:23.443
know anything about religious problems. When he was one

1054
00:54:23.443 --> 00:54:26.202
of the most devote, you know, adolescents in, you

1055
00:54:26.202 --> 00:54:28.722
know, uh, he was, he was thinking of being

1056
00:54:28.722 --> 00:54:31.002
a pastor and whatever. He, he had no idea.

1057
00:54:31.083 --> 00:54:34.113
He's never by experience had any notion of, uh,

1058
00:54:34.123 --> 00:54:36.802
religious problems. It's a lie, right? He doesn't know

1059
00:54:36.802 --> 00:54:40.123
anything about remorse. Uh, THAT'S a lie, right? A

1060
00:54:40.123 --> 00:54:43.206
person who's probably. Yeah, experienced remorse and guilt in

1061
00:54:43.206 --> 00:54:45.726
his life. Moreover, he contradicts himself in the, in

1062
00:54:45.726 --> 00:54:48.125
the book because he says, I will never forgive

1063
00:54:48.125 --> 00:54:50.696
myself for not having an instinct for self-defense. When,

1064
00:54:51.006 --> 00:54:53.085
remember when I was talking about he was lacking

1065
00:54:53.085 --> 00:54:55.516
that instincts of self-defense. He actually says, I will

1066
00:54:55.516 --> 00:54:58.115
never forgive myself for, for, for not have, for,

1067
00:54:58.285 --> 00:54:59.845
you know, it's something that I will never forgive

1068
00:54:59.845 --> 00:55:01.716
myself. OK, so he has remorse. So he's lying

1069
00:55:01.716 --> 00:55:03.506
all over the place. So it's a problematic book.

1070
00:55:04.530 --> 00:55:07.409
That's maybe part of the reason why I've shied

1071
00:55:07.409 --> 00:55:09.969
away a little bit from publishing this issue about

1072
00:55:09.969 --> 00:55:13.209
becoming who you are. But, uh, but in the

1073
00:55:13.209 --> 00:55:16.250
book, if you explore it, He's saying, look, the

1074
00:55:16.250 --> 00:55:22.050
mechanisms are mechanisms of self-reflection, self-understanding, self-knowledge, which you

1075
00:55:22.050 --> 00:55:24.649
have to be careful how you use. Yes, of

1076
00:55:24.649 --> 00:55:26.929
course, you have to sometimes not use them too

1077
00:55:26.929 --> 00:55:31.530
quickly, withdraw yourself, don't inject yourself into the causal

1078
00:55:31.530 --> 00:55:34.969
stream, adopt a fatalistic attitude sometimes, that is good,

1079
00:55:35.090 --> 00:55:38.080
right? Especially when you're sick because you don't wanna

1080
00:55:38.080 --> 00:55:40.969
become a reactive agent. You want to preserve your

1081
00:55:40.969 --> 00:55:43.250
freedom, yeah, that's kind of the, the impetus behind

1082
00:55:43.250 --> 00:55:47.270
it. So the mechanism is. I have to use

1083
00:55:47.270 --> 00:55:51.310
my freedom understood as a freedom that I exercise

1084
00:55:51.310 --> 00:55:55.669
through self-reflection and self-knowledge and self-understanding. But I have

1085
00:55:55.669 --> 00:56:00.689
to do it in ways that sometimes actually. Misunderstands,

1086
00:56:00.860 --> 00:56:05.860
right? Uses self-understanding to intentionally deceive myself about myself,

1087
00:56:06.169 --> 00:56:09.260
OK? So that I can preserve myself and that,

1088
00:56:09.500 --> 00:56:11.699
so that other things that are working inside of

1089
00:56:11.699 --> 00:56:15.550
me also. Have their say. So, uh, uh, one

1090
00:56:15.550 --> 00:56:17.590
thing that I wanna be uh careful about is

1091
00:56:17.989 --> 00:56:19.429
Nietzsche, I'm saying N Nietzsche has a kind of

1092
00:56:19.429 --> 00:56:21.510
libertarian notion of free will where he's saying, you

1093
00:56:21.510 --> 00:56:23.629
know, you're in control of your action through reflection

1094
00:56:23.629 --> 00:56:26.669
and all, but I'm not denying that he also

1095
00:56:26.669 --> 00:56:28.989
says, I have instincts and I am a natural

1096
00:56:28.989 --> 00:56:32.040
creature, and I'm Part of nature. I'm not transcendentally

1097
00:56:32.040 --> 00:56:35.939
detached from these other aspects of myself, right? Of

1098
00:56:35.939 --> 00:56:38.260
course, I am a natural creature with instincts that

1099
00:56:38.260 --> 00:56:41.219
are working secretly inside of me, maybe in ways

1100
00:56:41.219 --> 00:56:43.370
that I don't even know and I can't acknowledge,

1101
00:56:43.379 --> 00:56:45.300
and all of that is important. I got to

1102
00:56:45.300 --> 00:56:50.000
use that too. OK, my self-reflection has to let

1103
00:56:50.000 --> 00:56:53.600
those instincts develop naturally, give them good soil, do

1104
00:56:53.600 --> 00:56:56.199
those things, right, so that they don't make me

1105
00:56:56.199 --> 00:56:59.159
sick and that they can then accumulate all the

1106
00:56:59.159 --> 00:57:01.959
forces that I'm going to need when I recollect

1107
00:57:01.959 --> 00:57:05.600
myself in this moment of introspection and now understand

1108
00:57:05.600 --> 00:57:08.699
myself properly. Yeah, and then become who I am.

1109
00:57:08.979 --> 00:57:12.060
So the mechanism is a complicated mechanism in which

1110
00:57:12.280 --> 00:57:14.909
you are using a freedom that Nietzsche seems to

1111
00:57:14.909 --> 00:57:18.320
attribute to you, uh, that, that works by way

1112
00:57:18.320 --> 00:57:23.159
of self-reflection and self-understanding, and you need to do

1113
00:57:23.159 --> 00:57:28.729
it in ways that also. Uses strategically that self-reflection

1114
00:57:28.729 --> 00:57:32.729
and that self-understanding so that you don't get in

1115
00:57:32.729 --> 00:57:34.770
the way of yourself, right, and so that you

1116
00:57:34.770 --> 00:57:37.810
can become truly who you are instead of souring

1117
00:57:37.810 --> 00:57:40.649
the fruit of, of who you are, right, instead

1118
00:57:40.649 --> 00:57:44.370
of spoiling it, um, it's a, it's a delicate

1119
00:57:44.370 --> 00:57:46.989
process, right? That's kind of there, yeah, OK.

1120
00:57:47.585 --> 00:57:50.785
OK, OK, so let's talk a little bit more

1121
00:57:50.785 --> 00:57:54.186
about the ideal of sovereignty. You've already touched on

1122
00:57:54.186 --> 00:57:58.105
it several times in our previous questions, but, and

1123
00:57:58.105 --> 00:58:01.885
you talked also about what a morally responsible agent

1124
00:58:01.885 --> 00:58:05.216
is. But let me ask you another kind of

1125
00:58:05.216 --> 00:58:09.266
question about it. Uh, MANY people characterize Nietzsche as

1126
00:58:09.266 --> 00:58:14.031
a staunch opponent of the moral notion of guilt,

1127
00:58:14.362 --> 00:58:16.761
but in your reading of him, or at least

1128
00:58:16.761 --> 00:58:21.402
what I understood from your work, sovereignty entails embracing

1129
00:58:21.402 --> 00:58:24.481
one's susceptibility to moral guilt. So

1130
00:58:24.481 --> 00:58:24.681
could

1131
00:58:24.681 --> 00:58:25.491
you explain

1132
00:58:25.491 --> 00:58:29.392
that? Yeah, because sovereignty, I mean, so again, this,

1133
00:58:29.481 --> 00:58:30.672
this is going to take us a little bit

1134
00:58:30.672 --> 00:58:35.459
into the Genealogy right itself. So he is doing

1135
00:58:35.459 --> 00:58:39.350
a genealogy of morality, which is truly a history

1136
00:58:39.350 --> 00:58:41.899
of how we became, it's, it's really a history

1137
00:58:41.899 --> 00:58:44.870
of humanity. That's why this tree that he's constructing

1138
00:58:44.870 --> 00:58:47.679
is the tree of humanity whose fruit is supposed

1139
00:58:47.679 --> 00:58:50.100
to be the, the fruit that is promised at

1140
00:58:50.100 --> 00:58:52.639
the end of this tree is supposed to be

1141
00:58:52.899 --> 00:58:55.659
the sovereign individual. Now, why do I say a

1142
00:58:55.659 --> 00:58:58.989
tree? Because we are animals, but we are. Very

1143
00:58:58.989 --> 00:59:01.219
different from the rest of nature. OK, we're, we're

1144
00:59:01.219 --> 00:59:03.350
very different animals. What is the thing that makes

1145
00:59:03.350 --> 00:59:06.229
us different? Our spirit, our intellect, right? In, in

1146
00:59:06.229 --> 00:59:09.030
German, guys has this kind of like spirit, intellect,

1147
00:59:09.229 --> 00:59:13.510
mind, our mind, yes, our mind, our spirit, our

1148
00:59:13.510 --> 00:59:17.310
souls are different here, right, from the souls of

1149
00:59:17.310 --> 00:59:20.070
other creatures. How did we get this soul? This

1150
00:59:20.070 --> 00:59:22.540
is what the genealogy is trying to retrace. So

1151
00:59:22.540 --> 00:59:27.320
the genealogy is actually retracing the story. Of how

1152
00:59:27.320 --> 00:59:33.389
we developed the sorts of Deep spiritual capacities that

1153
00:59:33.389 --> 00:59:35.310
set us apart from the rest of the animal

1154
00:59:35.310 --> 00:59:40.270
kingdom, OK, um, now, uh, what are these capacities?

1155
00:59:40.389 --> 00:59:43.899
Mainly moral capacities. What distinguishes us from other animals

1156
00:59:43.899 --> 00:59:46.510
truly in the end, is that we're the moral

1157
00:59:46.510 --> 00:59:48.929
animals. We're the animals who can guide our behavior

1158
00:59:49.469 --> 00:59:54.270
by moral norms, OK? So, uh, so the story

1159
00:59:54.270 --> 00:59:55.750
Nietzsche is telling us is the story of how

1160
00:59:55.750 --> 00:59:57.989
we became the moral creatures we are in some

1161
00:59:57.989 --> 01:00:01.010
sense. It's also the story of how we've spoiled.

1162
01:00:02.590 --> 01:00:04.739
The posit, the, the, the, the, the thing that

1163
01:00:04.739 --> 01:00:07.020
is promised at the end of this long history.

1164
01:00:07.270 --> 01:00:08.510
The thing that is promised at the end of

1165
01:00:08.510 --> 01:00:11.030
this, the long history is, you're gonna become the

1166
01:00:11.030 --> 01:00:13.969
sovereign, you could become the sovereign individual, the master

1167
01:00:13.969 --> 01:00:17.199
of a free will. OK, and all that stuff.

1168
01:00:17.719 --> 01:00:21.479
He describes it, maybe I can read some parts

1169
01:00:21.479 --> 01:00:23.350
of it in order, we'll see, but, you know,

1170
01:00:23.550 --> 01:00:26.600
uh, he did, there's a, there's a very eloquent

1171
01:00:26.600 --> 01:00:29.120
language that he's using throughout that passage in the

1172
01:00:29.120 --> 01:00:32.350
sovereign individual. It's that language that I By the

1173
01:00:32.350 --> 01:00:36.189
way, I want to emphasize again, recalls the noble

1174
01:00:36.189 --> 01:00:38.790
person of the first treaties in all sorts of

1175
01:00:38.790 --> 01:00:42.530
ways, not just by mentioning mastery and, and lordship,

1176
01:00:42.909 --> 01:00:45.469
uh, or being a lord, uh, like 4 or

1177
01:00:45.469 --> 01:00:47.949
5 times, I forget, OK. He's a lord of

1178
01:00:47.949 --> 01:00:50.725
every will. He's a lord of the other creatures.

1179
01:00:50.764 --> 01:00:52.905
He's a lord of, he's lord, Lord, Lord, he's

1180
01:00:52.905 --> 01:00:56.125
lording everything, OK? So he's a master. Um, BUT

1181
01:00:56.125 --> 01:00:58.294
also by recalling things that he had said about

1182
01:00:58.294 --> 01:01:00.215
the master at the end, he had said the

1183
01:01:00.215 --> 01:01:03.514
master, you know, we live under a slave morality

1184
01:01:03.514 --> 01:01:06.895
that has made us not fear masters anymore. We

1185
01:01:06.895 --> 01:01:09.814
have no masters anymore, and there's nothing to fear

1186
01:01:09.814 --> 01:01:12.495
in the human being anymore. But there's also nothing

1187
01:01:12.495 --> 01:01:15.014
to reverence in the human being anymore. This is

1188
01:01:15.014 --> 01:01:17.774
the big problem, right, for N Nietzsche. Well, guess

1189
01:01:17.774 --> 01:01:24.790
what? The sovereign individual, he arouses trust, fear, reverence,

1190
01:01:24.919 --> 01:01:27.439
he tells us in that passage. Oh shit. So

1191
01:01:27.439 --> 01:01:29.840
that's it, sorry, pardon my French, right? That's the,

1192
01:01:30.080 --> 01:01:33.600
that's the, that's the, the, the noble creature, right,

1193
01:01:33.639 --> 01:01:36.149
that he was talking about in the first treatise.

1194
01:01:36.909 --> 01:01:40.929
He's been called that language, OK. So, Uh, you

1195
01:01:40.929 --> 01:01:44.969
know, very important, but this fruit is spoiled. The

1196
01:01:44.969 --> 01:01:46.969
story in the genealogy is the story of how

1197
01:01:46.969 --> 01:01:50.370
this fruit could be the promise, the completion of

1198
01:01:50.370 --> 01:01:55.330
mankind after this long process, but it's also not

1199
01:01:55.330 --> 01:01:58.929
the fruit we have because the ascetic ideal has

1200
01:01:58.929 --> 01:02:02.570
spoiled the fruit. We have science today, which is

1201
01:02:02.570 --> 01:02:04.649
not the opposite of the ascetic ideal, but it's,

1202
01:02:04.729 --> 01:02:07.840
it's latest manifestation. OK. Now, go back to the

1203
01:02:07.840 --> 01:02:10.620
fruit for a second. What is this fruit? Well,

1204
01:02:10.820 --> 01:02:12.459
again, it's to have a free will, but what

1205
01:02:12.459 --> 01:02:13.979
is it to have a free, to be, not

1206
01:02:13.979 --> 01:02:14.979
just to have a free will, but to be

1207
01:02:14.979 --> 01:02:17.139
a master of a free will. OK. What is

1208
01:02:17.139 --> 01:02:19.060
it to have free will? It's to think of

1209
01:02:19.060 --> 01:02:21.790
yourself as spontaneous in good and evil. And to

1210
01:02:21.790 --> 01:02:24.010
think of yourselves as I could have done otherwise,

1211
01:02:24.459 --> 01:02:28.209
which also implies When I do the evil thing,

1212
01:02:28.610 --> 01:02:31.330
I feel guilty, OK? I don't, I don't like

1213
01:02:31.330 --> 01:02:33.590
that I, that things didn't come out very well.

1214
01:02:33.850 --> 01:02:36.709
I feel polluted in my self-image. I feel like

1215
01:02:37.129 --> 01:02:41.600
my actions have now betrayed. My sovereignty if you

1216
01:02:41.600 --> 01:02:45.330
wish, right? Understood simply as free will, right? So,

1217
01:02:48.530 --> 01:02:51.300
The conception that we get at the end has

1218
01:02:51.300 --> 01:02:53.250
to incorporate all these elements. I think this is

1219
01:02:53.250 --> 01:02:56.300
something that the literature has missed. The literature tends

1220
01:02:56.300 --> 01:02:58.780
to think that Nietzsche is contrary to guilt because

1221
01:02:58.780 --> 01:03:01.540
he's against guilt is very bad. It makes you

1222
01:03:01.540 --> 01:03:04.179
feel bad and it gives you self-contempt about what

1223
01:03:04.179 --> 01:03:06.479
you've done and all those things. It's also a

1224
01:03:06.524 --> 01:03:09.084
Associated, as I just said, mentioned with the libertarian

1225
01:03:09.084 --> 01:03:11.364
free will, which he is rejecting, right? He's supposed

1226
01:03:11.364 --> 01:03:13.524
to be rejecting that, but as I've been trying

1227
01:03:13.524 --> 01:03:16.324
to emphasize to you already several times, I don't

1228
01:03:16.324 --> 01:03:19.245
think that's true. He's, he's, he's actually using this

1229
01:03:19.245 --> 01:03:23.245
notion of free will positively in this passage, for

1230
01:03:23.245 --> 01:03:26.479
instance, right? Um, That's the free will that we,

1231
01:03:26.979 --> 01:03:30.139
so he's not against guilt. Now, of course, Nietzsche

1232
01:03:30.139 --> 01:03:32.300
is supremely nuanced. It's going back to the issue

1233
01:03:32.300 --> 01:03:34.919
of he's very intentional. The reason he's intentional is

1234
01:03:34.919 --> 01:03:37.850
because he's very nuanced. The, the, the, the, the,

1235
01:03:37.899 --> 01:03:41.179
the, the words he used, especially adjectives or adverbs

1236
01:03:41.179 --> 01:03:45.280
that he's gonna use, very intentional because they, they

1237
01:03:45.290 --> 01:03:48.649
introduce a twist into what you have to be

1238
01:03:48.659 --> 01:03:51.729
understanding, OK? Him to be saying to you, right?

1239
01:03:52.020 --> 01:03:54.300
And so the twist here is, look, guilt is

1240
01:03:54.300 --> 01:03:59.719
dangerous. OK. Guilt, of course, is, it can be

1241
01:04:00.600 --> 01:04:05.620
used against the human being. In very pernicious ways,

1242
01:04:05.959 --> 01:04:10.139
especially by the ascetic priest who uses it to

1243
01:04:10.360 --> 01:04:12.919
turn the human being into a sinful creature, for

1244
01:04:12.919 --> 01:04:16.060
instance, right, in Christianity, or, or even in Buddhism,

1245
01:04:16.219 --> 01:04:18.620
or even in, I think N Nietzsche thinks all

1246
01:04:18.620 --> 01:04:21.600
ascetic religions do this, right, in the end. They

1247
01:04:21.600 --> 01:04:24.600
use the concept of guilt in order to make

1248
01:04:24.600 --> 01:04:29.550
you into a sinner, which means You are inherently

1249
01:04:29.550 --> 01:04:32.500
corrupt, and what is the thing that's corrupt in

1250
01:04:32.500 --> 01:04:36.590
you? What is the corruption stemming from? Your free

1251
01:04:36.590 --> 01:04:39.469
will, right? Precisely because you are spontaneous in good

1252
01:04:39.469 --> 01:04:41.790
and evil, precisely because you could have done otherwise.

1253
01:04:41.989 --> 01:04:44.270
That's the source of the problem, right? So, you're

1254
01:04:44.270 --> 01:04:47.340
using your guilt against you in a superlative way

1255
01:04:47.340 --> 01:04:49.629
and in a kind of exaggerated way, and that

1256
01:04:49.629 --> 01:04:52.290
leads to sin. Nietzsche is very much against that,

1257
01:04:52.429 --> 01:04:55.000
for sure. But that doesn't mean that there are

1258
01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:58.439
positive uses of guilt. Yes, of course, we, guilt

1259
01:04:58.439 --> 01:05:01.520
is part of our moral psychology. It's part of

1260
01:05:01.520 --> 01:05:03.320
who we are as human beings and what makes

1261
01:05:03.320 --> 01:05:07.060
us special as human beings. What holds the promise

1262
01:05:07.280 --> 01:05:10.000
of sovereignty for us, could hold the promise. If

1263
01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:12.510
you only became a master over that free will

1264
01:05:12.510 --> 01:05:15.560
and over, over that guilt that you have, and

1265
01:05:15.560 --> 01:05:18.800
that you naturally have to experience because you are

1266
01:05:18.800 --> 01:05:20.840
a, a, a creature that understands itself in those

1267
01:05:20.840 --> 01:05:24.439
moral terms. If you became a master over it,

1268
01:05:25.030 --> 01:05:27.350
now you would be sovereign, right? Now you would

1269
01:05:27.350 --> 01:05:29.709
be sovereign, and the guilt would not consume you

1270
01:05:29.709 --> 01:05:32.489
to the point of turning you into a sinner

1271
01:05:32.489 --> 01:05:35.620
or to the point of making you renounce your

1272
01:05:35.620 --> 01:05:38.629
sovereignty, which is ultimately the, the thing that the

1273
01:05:38.629 --> 01:05:43.350
ascetic ideal wants, OK, I think my interpretation, um.

1274
01:05:43.860 --> 01:05:45.580
So, so that would be the way I, I,

1275
01:05:45.659 --> 01:05:47.139
I, I, I, I would connect it. The problem

1276
01:05:47.139 --> 01:05:49.739
is not moral guilt. The problem is not understanding

1277
01:05:49.739 --> 01:05:54.139
yourself as a, uh, libertarian, uh, free will endowed

1278
01:05:54.139 --> 01:05:57.020
creature. Uh, THE, none of those are the problems.

1279
01:05:57.100 --> 01:05:59.139
The problem is whether you use all those categories

1280
01:05:59.139 --> 01:06:01.209
that you, that, that are now inherent to you,

1281
01:06:01.409 --> 01:06:02.979
whether they're true or not, by the way, again,

1282
01:06:03.080 --> 01:06:06.699
going back to your. Question back then about like

1283
01:06:07.040 --> 01:06:09.199
isn't this contradictory what is the picture of the

1284
01:06:09.199 --> 01:06:11.080
world? Do we really have a libertarian free will

1285
01:06:11.080 --> 01:06:14.399
or not? I don't I don't care. I need

1286
01:06:14.399 --> 01:06:16.570
to, yeah, I don't care, right? I, I'm gonna

1287
01:06:16.570 --> 01:06:21.540
use the notion of free will masterfully, right, nobly

1288
01:06:21.679 --> 01:06:25.110
to enhance myself and my fellow human beings as

1289
01:06:25.110 --> 01:06:27.520
much as I can, which is the task, OK,

1290
01:06:27.879 --> 01:06:35.719
um, and, uh, and, and, uh, um. What matters

1291
01:06:35.719 --> 01:06:38.379
is then, you know, the novel uses I'm putting

1292
01:06:38.379 --> 01:06:41.949
this concept to. The fact that it could also

1293
01:06:41.949 --> 01:06:45.389
be used slavishly, right? Well, yeah, of course, it

1294
01:06:45.389 --> 01:06:47.110
could also be used slavishly, and it, and when

1295
01:06:47.110 --> 01:06:49.989
it's done that way, guilt is very bad, it's

1296
01:06:49.989 --> 01:06:53.149
terrible, just like when free will is used slavishly.

1297
01:06:53.810 --> 01:06:57.310
Yeah, the libertarian free will, which the genealogy talks

1298
01:06:57.310 --> 01:06:59.850
a lot about how, how the, the slave and

1299
01:06:59.850 --> 01:07:03.770
the priest use this concept to subjugate, to enslave,

1300
01:07:03.969 --> 01:07:06.889
to belittle, to do, to, to humiliate, to do

1301
01:07:06.889 --> 01:07:09.000
all those things. OK, yeah, when the, when it's

1302
01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:13.590
used that way, terrible, OK, guilt, bad. But this

1303
01:07:13.590 --> 01:07:15.350
is the nuance of N Nietzsche. This is how

1304
01:07:15.350 --> 01:07:17.429
he's beyond good and evil. One of the lessons

1305
01:07:17.429 --> 01:07:19.510
of beyond good and evil is, look, the things

1306
01:07:19.510 --> 01:07:22.270
we call good, they're also evil. The things we

1307
01:07:22.270 --> 01:07:25.270
call evil, they're also good, OK? They're like, there

1308
01:07:25.270 --> 01:07:29.580
is no huge distinction here, right, in values. The,

1309
01:07:29.649 --> 01:07:33.510
the, there's a nuance. It depends what forces are,

1310
01:07:33.550 --> 01:07:36.250
are using these things and how they're using them.

1311
01:07:36.459 --> 01:07:40.830
Tyranny is evil. But used in the right way,

1312
01:07:41.070 --> 01:07:42.989
right, which is, of course, I mean, this is

1313
01:07:42.989 --> 01:07:45.750
a problematic claim, but anyways, used in the right

1314
01:07:45.750 --> 01:07:48.189
way, tyranny could be good, right? It could be

1315
01:07:48.189 --> 01:07:53.790
good, yeah, uh. Morality is a tyranny against the

1316
01:07:53.790 --> 01:07:56.949
animal self that, that you are, for instance, yeah?

1317
01:07:57.189 --> 01:07:59.189
But that's a great tyranny because it has bred

1318
01:07:59.189 --> 01:08:01.550
in you the capacities to be in control of

1319
01:08:01.550 --> 01:08:04.209
your desires and your passions or to think of

1320
01:08:04.209 --> 01:08:05.629
yourself as being in control of your desires and

1321
01:08:05.629 --> 01:08:08.610
your passions, of your animal self. You're in control

1322
01:08:08.610 --> 01:08:11.139
of your animal self. How did we manage that?

1323
01:08:11.229 --> 01:08:13.909
We tyrannized against you with blood and suffering and

1324
01:08:13.909 --> 01:08:17.350
cruelty and horrendous methods. That's part of the lesson

1325
01:08:17.350 --> 01:08:19.930
of the genealogy. But that was great. I mean,

1326
01:08:20.169 --> 01:08:22.649
you know, it, it was horrible too. It also

1327
01:08:22.649 --> 01:08:26.439
bred a mentally ill creature, yeah? A creature that

1328
01:08:26.439 --> 01:08:28.490
now is in, in, in, in some tension with

1329
01:08:28.490 --> 01:08:32.129
its animal self, right? Constantly, a tension that hasn't

1330
01:08:32.129 --> 01:08:35.649
gone away because we are all constantly struggling with

1331
01:08:35.649 --> 01:08:39.009
not becoming libertines, not becoming just vulgar pigs that

1332
01:08:39.009 --> 01:08:41.479
just wanna, like, you know, Smoke a lot of

1333
01:08:41.479 --> 01:08:44.120
drugs and like go out and and have sex

1334
01:08:44.120 --> 01:08:46.100
with everything under the sun and like you know

1335
01:08:46.279 --> 01:08:49.680
uh waste my life doing ple pleasant things that

1336
01:08:49.680 --> 01:08:52.279
are just the most vulgar things in the world

1337
01:08:52.520 --> 01:08:55.439
you that the the struggle is constant right not

1338
01:08:55.439 --> 01:08:59.279
to not to um revert back to that kind

1339
01:08:59.279 --> 01:09:04.799
of animalistic. Predatory existence that we came out of,

1340
01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:07.879
right? Um, IT is very clear on that. So,

1341
01:09:08.040 --> 01:09:11.910
so. We gotta, we, we gotta find a way

1342
01:09:11.910 --> 01:09:13.910
in which we can use all these categories we

1343
01:09:13.910 --> 01:09:15.899
are now endowed with that are part of our

1344
01:09:15.899 --> 01:09:18.720
humanity in order to, here's what I would say.

1345
01:09:18.910 --> 01:09:20.229
What is it to become a master of a

1346
01:09:20.229 --> 01:09:22.229
free will? It's a little bit to overcome your

1347
01:09:22.229 --> 01:09:26.000
humanity, right, to overcome the ways in which your,

1348
01:09:26.049 --> 01:09:28.390
the human aspect, the human all to human aspects

1349
01:09:28.390 --> 01:09:30.649
of you, your understanding of yourself as a free

1350
01:09:30.890 --> 01:09:34.270
being, your propensity to guilt, your understanding of yourself

1351
01:09:34.270 --> 01:09:36.810
as a, as a being that can do otherwise.

1352
01:09:37.609 --> 01:09:40.649
Can be used against you, can be used against

1353
01:09:40.649 --> 01:09:43.689
other people, right, etc. So I need to overcome

1354
01:09:43.689 --> 01:09:46.330
that aspect of my humanity. Learn to use guilt

1355
01:09:46.330 --> 01:09:48.850
in a, in a way that ennobles as opposed

1356
01:09:48.850 --> 01:09:52.890
to, uh, diminishes or belittles the human being, humiliates

1357
01:09:52.890 --> 01:09:54.189
the human being. Yeah.

1358
01:09:54.890 --> 01:09:59.399
OK, so, on the topic or the ideal of

1359
01:09:59.399 --> 01:10:04.379
wholeness then. The most prevalent readings characterize this idea,

1360
01:10:04.580 --> 01:10:08.060
this is an ideal of psychic unity aimed at

1361
01:10:08.060 --> 01:10:12.060
restructuring the various parts of the agent's mind into

1362
01:10:12.060 --> 01:10:16.100
a harmonious whole. What is your opinion on this

1363
01:10:16.100 --> 01:10:16.819
thing? Yeah,

1364
01:10:16.899 --> 01:10:21.560
I, I, I disagree. OK, so, uh, of course.

1365
01:10:22.600 --> 01:10:26.279
Remember that it's, it's linked. This ideal of wholeness

1366
01:10:26.279 --> 01:10:28.359
is very linked also with the idea of becoming

1367
01:10:28.359 --> 01:10:31.479
who you are, uh, when you trace it, it

1368
01:10:31.479 --> 01:10:34.560
tends to occur, uh, in con they tend to

1369
01:10:34.560 --> 01:10:38.540
occur close together a little bit in places, um.

1370
01:10:39.819 --> 01:10:42.819
And so there's a tendency that maybe it's natural

1371
01:10:42.819 --> 01:10:45.259
to think, oh, what Nietzsche is talking about, especially

1372
01:10:45.259 --> 01:10:47.580
when we think of moral psychology and all that

1373
01:10:47.580 --> 01:10:49.580
stuff, that what Nietzsche is talking about is integrating

1374
01:10:49.580 --> 01:10:52.580
your mental life, right? You have drives and desires

1375
01:10:52.580 --> 01:10:55.859
and passions and, and ways of thinking and whatever,

1376
01:10:55.890 --> 01:10:57.939
and you got to integrate all of this into

1377
01:10:57.939 --> 01:11:01.810
some coherent whole and then You become whole, right?

1378
01:11:01.859 --> 01:11:03.549
That's what it needs to become whole. Whereas if

1379
01:11:03.770 --> 01:11:07.109
these parts of your, of your psyche are all

1380
01:11:07.109 --> 01:11:10.549
over the place, they're disintegrated, they're fragmented. Now the

1381
01:11:10.549 --> 01:11:12.390
reason I disagree with this picture is that when

1382
01:11:12.390 --> 01:11:15.109
you go to the place where Nietzsche really talks

1383
01:11:15.109 --> 01:11:17.729
about wholeness, because he talks about wholeness in this

1384
01:11:17.910 --> 01:11:21.750
scattered places all over the place, uh, throughout most

1385
01:11:21.750 --> 01:11:25.529
of his, uh, books, later books in, in, in

1386
01:11:25.529 --> 01:11:27.890
uh Beyond Gan El or in Twilight or whatever,

1387
01:11:28.189 --> 01:11:32.350
um. But it's kind of, you know, here and

1388
01:11:32.350 --> 01:11:35.290
there, right, in, in, in, in some alphorisms. The

1389
01:11:35.290 --> 01:11:37.410
place where he really talks about, hey, we have

1390
01:11:37.410 --> 01:11:40.399
a longing to become whole, we should become whole,

1391
01:11:40.500 --> 01:11:43.370
with, is the untimely meditations. And when you go

1392
01:11:43.370 --> 01:11:45.410
there, what you realize is that the talk of

1393
01:11:45.410 --> 01:11:50.529
wholeness is Embedded in a in a concern with

1394
01:11:50.529 --> 01:11:53.419
what Nietzsche calls culture which he actually defines by

1395
01:11:53.419 --> 01:11:55.430
using the notion of unity. He says, you know,

1396
01:11:55.700 --> 01:11:58.560
the culture is the unity in the artistic, uh,

1397
01:11:58.660 --> 01:12:01.870
in, in every aspect of the, of the people,

1398
01:12:02.060 --> 01:12:06.770
uh, which means they're, uh, forging into unity content

1399
01:12:06.770 --> 01:12:09.779
and form, right, something like that, paraphrasing very badly,

1400
01:12:09.859 --> 01:12:13.450
but you know, something like that, um, so. So,

1401
01:12:13.459 --> 01:12:16.779
it's really the concern with culture and, and, and

1402
01:12:16.779 --> 01:12:19.220
the ways in which our modern culture in particular

1403
01:12:19.220 --> 01:12:21.580
is a fragmented culture, is a culture that doesn't

1404
01:12:21.580 --> 01:12:26.899
contribute to wholeness but contributes to disorientation, fragmentation of

1405
01:12:26.899 --> 01:12:30.529
the individuals that live in it. Um, IT'S in

1406
01:12:30.529 --> 01:12:32.540
the context of that that Nietzsche says you should

1407
01:12:32.540 --> 01:12:35.520
become who you are, namely, whole, right? You should

1408
01:12:35.520 --> 01:12:38.979
become whole. That's what, that's the task, wholeness. Wholeness

1409
01:12:38.979 --> 01:12:41.419
of the individual and through the individual, wholeness of

1410
01:12:41.419 --> 01:12:44.899
the culture as a whole. OK. What does that

1411
01:12:44.899 --> 01:12:47.060
mean then, right? What is it to become whole

1412
01:12:47.060 --> 01:12:49.580
in this way? In my reading, and, and what

1413
01:12:49.580 --> 01:12:51.500
Nietzsche tells us in, in this meditation is, well,

1414
01:12:51.569 --> 01:12:54.020
you gotta work at a goal, the goal of

1415
01:12:54.020 --> 01:12:56.020
culture, which is the goal of culture, the production

1416
01:12:56.020 --> 01:12:58.660
of the genius in yourself and in all. This

1417
01:12:58.660 --> 01:13:00.419
brings us back to this issue of uniqueness that

1418
01:13:00.419 --> 01:13:03.140
we touched on, uh, a little bit way back,

1419
01:13:03.259 --> 01:13:06.939
right? Everybody has a, a genius, right? Everybody has

1420
01:13:07.120 --> 01:13:11.540
this thing that could raise itself from animality. OK.

1421
01:13:11.899 --> 01:13:16.500
This is also a very uh eloquent uh theme

1422
01:13:16.500 --> 01:13:18.759
or, or a theme that, that is very audible

1423
01:13:18.979 --> 01:13:23.540
uh in uh the, the, the meditations, this clash

1424
01:13:23.540 --> 01:13:26.540
with animality, right? Constantly, Nietzsche is trying to tell

1425
01:13:26.540 --> 01:13:28.899
us the genius is the guy who's no longer

1426
01:13:28.899 --> 01:13:31.520
animal, right? The, the guy who has raised himself

1427
01:13:32.100 --> 01:13:36.459
from animality, who's trying to become truly human, a

1428
01:13:36.459 --> 01:13:39.339
genuine human being, right? How do I become a

1429
01:13:39.339 --> 01:13:42.680
genuine human? By overcoming my animality, by, by overcoming

1430
01:13:42.680 --> 01:13:45.959
the things that are animality, right? Um, THAT'S how

1431
01:13:45.959 --> 01:13:48.439
I become truly human. And what is that equivalent

1432
01:13:48.439 --> 01:13:51.279
to? It's becoming free. It's becoming a free personality.

1433
01:13:52.310 --> 01:13:55.430
My animality is keeping me from my free personality,

1434
01:13:55.589 --> 01:13:57.430
right? Here I am. It has a kind of

1435
01:13:57.430 --> 01:14:00.470
existentialist undercurrent, right, to the whole thing. Here I

1436
01:14:00.470 --> 01:14:03.109
am a being in this world. It was by

1437
01:14:03.109 --> 01:14:05.569
chance. I'm a being in becoming. I'm an animal,

1438
01:14:05.830 --> 01:14:07.589
right? Of course. I'm not denying that you're an

1439
01:14:07.589 --> 01:14:09.990
animal, Nietzsche, right? Nietzsche is not denying that you're

1440
01:14:09.990 --> 01:14:12.200
an animal. Of course we're all animals. But am

1441
01:14:12.200 --> 01:14:14.250
I gonna be just like the squirrel? Am I

1442
01:14:14.250 --> 01:14:17.569
gonna repeat squirrelly behaviors? Am I gonna be, or

1443
01:14:17.569 --> 01:14:20.129
am I gonna change the world I've been foisted

1444
01:14:20.129 --> 01:14:23.259
into? Am I gonna legislate values to the world?

1445
01:14:23.339 --> 01:14:25.250
Am I gonna become my own person? Am I

1446
01:14:25.250 --> 01:14:27.339
gonna become free? And am I gonna become a

1447
01:14:27.339 --> 01:14:31.910
free personality that Legislate values to itself and to

1448
01:14:31.910 --> 01:14:34.270
the and to the world, right? And what values

1449
01:14:34.270 --> 01:14:38.509
should those be? That's the question. And the values

1450
01:14:38.509 --> 01:14:40.310
they should be, I think, according to the early

1451
01:14:40.310 --> 01:14:43.649
Nietzsche is the values that allow genius to flourish,

1452
01:14:44.229 --> 01:14:46.910
that's to say that allow people to do precisely

1453
01:14:46.910 --> 01:14:48.790
what I'm saying we should do, namely raise ourselves

1454
01:14:48.790 --> 01:14:54.060
above animality, legislate values, change culture, change society. In

1455
01:14:54.060 --> 01:14:56.959
the direction of what? In the direction of making

1456
01:14:56.959 --> 01:15:01.439
us genius, right? Geniuses, right? Uh, Nietzsche is very

1457
01:15:01.439 --> 01:15:04.790
universalist in the language he uses, even though he's

1458
01:15:04.790 --> 01:15:07.819
also conscious of the fact that not everybody will

1459
01:15:08.520 --> 01:15:11.600
be a genius, not everybody will realize their productive

1460
01:15:11.600 --> 01:15:15.419
uniqueness. Most of us will remain trapped in animality,

1461
01:15:15.600 --> 01:15:17.759
but maybe we can remain trapped in an animality

1462
01:15:17.759 --> 01:15:20.279
that is a little bit more ennobled and it's

1463
01:15:20.279 --> 01:15:23.220
not just debased and vulgar and libertine or whatever,

1464
01:15:23.439 --> 01:15:26.990
if We all, nonetheless, are trying to struggle in

1465
01:15:26.990 --> 01:15:31.350
pursuit of this cultural goal of genuine culture, which

1466
01:15:31.350 --> 01:15:33.759
is the production of the genius, the production of

1467
01:15:33.990 --> 01:15:36.750
the genius in myself and in everybody else. But

1468
01:15:36.750 --> 01:15:38.910
if I fail to produce it in myself, there's

1469
01:15:38.910 --> 01:15:41.180
still value, there's still the kind of dignity that

1470
01:15:41.180 --> 01:15:44.709
I have because I've, I've worked for that. I

1471
01:15:44.709 --> 01:15:47.029
tried, right? I, I was trying to contribute to

1472
01:15:47.029 --> 01:15:49.700
that. So that's really what it is. Now, notice,

1473
01:15:49.750 --> 01:15:51.660
if you put it in those terms, that's how

1474
01:15:51.660 --> 01:15:53.740
I become whole. I become whole because I became

1475
01:15:53.740 --> 01:15:56.459
part of this project that is a collective project

1476
01:15:56.620 --> 01:16:00.140
that is constantly being reinvented by all of us

1477
01:16:00.609 --> 01:16:02.140
together because it's the project of how do we

1478
01:16:02.140 --> 01:16:05.339
bring about freedom and genius in the world. How

1479
01:16:05.339 --> 01:16:07.240
do we bring about the elevation of the human

1480
01:16:07.240 --> 01:16:11.080
being from its animality, right? Uh, INTO the world.

1481
01:16:11.189 --> 01:16:13.799
What does it mean to become free in that

1482
01:16:13.799 --> 01:16:16.799
sense? That's a project we're collectively constructing all the

1483
01:16:16.799 --> 01:16:19.839
time, OK? Together. And if we are into that

1484
01:16:19.839 --> 01:16:21.830
project collectively as a culture as a whole, if

1485
01:16:21.830 --> 01:16:24.240
our institutions are in the business of trying to

1486
01:16:24.240 --> 01:16:26.879
produce geniuses, if our governments are trying to do

1487
01:16:26.879 --> 01:16:29.359
that, if our economic system is trying to do

1488
01:16:29.359 --> 01:16:32.120
that, if a society, everything in society is trying

1489
01:16:32.120 --> 01:16:33.819
to do that, then we have a genuine culture.

1490
01:16:34.299 --> 01:16:37.819
And our genuine culture will transcend itself. It will

1491
01:16:37.819 --> 01:16:40.259
become eternal, right? It becomes a culture that we

1492
01:16:40.259 --> 01:16:42.500
can all benefit from, even when the culture is

1493
01:16:42.500 --> 01:16:44.979
dead, right? Like the Greeks, right? The Greeks are

1494
01:16:44.979 --> 01:16:47.459
dead. The ancient Greeks, right, are dead, but we

1495
01:16:47.459 --> 01:16:50.220
can benefit from tragedy. I, here is my book,

1496
01:16:50.229 --> 01:16:52.629
Birth of Tragedy, right? And I'm gonna explain to

1497
01:16:52.629 --> 01:16:55.899
you how we could recover some of the ways

1498
01:16:55.899 --> 01:16:59.939
in which tragedy was doing precisely this to the

1499
01:16:59.939 --> 01:17:03.959
Greeks of that time, namely, Putting them in the

1500
01:17:03.959 --> 01:17:08.399
direction of pursuing the, the. The task of creating

1501
01:17:08.399 --> 01:17:10.899
a genuine culture for themselves and for everybody else,

1502
01:17:11.120 --> 01:17:13.040
right? That's what tragedy did for the Greeks in

1503
01:17:13.040 --> 01:17:15.520
a nutshell, kind of. Uh, WE could do the

1504
01:17:15.520 --> 01:17:17.879
same. Maybe Wagnerian Opera can do it, right? That's

1505
01:17:17.879 --> 01:17:20.120
Nietzsche's story in the, in Birth of Tragedy to

1506
01:17:20.120 --> 01:17:23.959
some extent. Um, SO, so, that's how we become

1507
01:17:23.959 --> 01:17:27.399
whole and that doesn't require psychic integration. I could

1508
01:17:27.399 --> 01:17:31.000
be at this gentle, uh, I mean, not too

1509
01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:32.839
much, of course, right? We, we do need a

1510
01:17:32.839 --> 01:17:35.120
little bit of mental integration. We can't be just

1511
01:17:35.319 --> 01:17:39.080
a completely chaotic, uh, uh, you know, bundle of

1512
01:17:39.080 --> 01:17:41.220
drives and affects and. Passions and like, you know,

1513
01:17:41.479 --> 01:17:44.299
and, and thinkings and desires and wants and if

1514
01:17:44.299 --> 01:17:46.930
we are totally chaotic, then we cannot act. We

1515
01:17:46.930 --> 01:17:49.700
cannot be free in the world, right? Of course,

1516
01:17:49.759 --> 01:17:52.060
there has to be mental integration, a minimum of

1517
01:17:52.060 --> 01:17:55.060
mental integration, but the task is not to integrate

1518
01:17:55.060 --> 01:17:58.140
everything in my mental life, uh, in the pursuit

1519
01:17:58.140 --> 01:17:59.939
of this goal. There might be things that are,

1520
01:18:00.180 --> 01:18:02.899
you know, I, I leave behind or I, I

1521
01:18:02.899 --> 01:18:05.299
still struggle with in the pursuit of this goal,

1522
01:18:05.419 --> 01:18:07.709
my sensuality for For instance, if Nietzsche is right,

1523
01:18:07.799 --> 01:18:10.160
right, I want to be a libertine, but I'm

1524
01:18:10.160 --> 01:18:13.770
not gonna be a libertine. I can't integrate libertinism

1525
01:18:13.770 --> 01:18:16.200
into the goal of pursuing the genius. So, you

1526
01:18:16.200 --> 01:18:19.839
know what, I'm gonna repress that side of me

1527
01:18:19.839 --> 01:18:22.160
that wants to be a libertine or whatever, right?

1528
01:18:22.359 --> 01:18:25.240
So I'm not mentally integrated after all, right, in

1529
01:18:25.240 --> 01:18:27.439
that sense. I haven't integrated all my wants and

1530
01:18:27.439 --> 01:18:29.330
all my desires and all my things into one

1531
01:18:29.330 --> 01:18:32.279
coherent goal because there are desires and things that

1532
01:18:32.279 --> 01:18:35.140
I'm Constantly keeping away from the coherent goal that

1533
01:18:35.140 --> 01:18:38.020
I'm trying to pursue, which is the, the, the

1534
01:18:38.020 --> 01:18:40.439
genius in uh, in myself and in everybody else,

1535
01:18:40.660 --> 01:18:43.779
you see. So, I, so, now, of course, I

1536
01:18:43.779 --> 01:18:46.160
wanna be careful. I, I'm not denying that maybe

1537
01:18:46.160 --> 01:18:49.450
it, it, it's typical of people who do pursue

1538
01:18:49.450 --> 01:18:52.330
the, the genius that they managed to integrate every

1539
01:18:52.330 --> 01:18:54.620
aspect of their mental lives into a coherent whole.

1540
01:18:54.729 --> 01:18:58.100
Maybe that's a natural result of actually pursuing the

1541
01:18:58.100 --> 01:19:01.839
genius. But it's not a necessary feature of pursuing

1542
01:19:01.839 --> 01:19:04.040
a genius, and it's not what pursuing the genius

1543
01:19:04.040 --> 01:19:07.430
means. What pursuing the genius means I'm working for

1544
01:19:07.430 --> 01:19:10.430
the genius out there, and what, and, and in

1545
01:19:10.430 --> 01:19:13.069
me, but what is that working about? It's about

1546
01:19:13.069 --> 01:19:17.689
becoming free, becoming the Unique individual that can make

1547
01:19:17.990 --> 01:19:20.879
its own laws and standards and contribute to society

1548
01:19:20.879 --> 01:19:23.419
by making his own laws and standards, which laws

1549
01:19:23.419 --> 01:19:27.100
and standards are governed by the duty or the,

1550
01:19:27.350 --> 01:19:30.069
or the idea that I have a duty to

1551
01:19:30.069 --> 01:19:32.419
produce genius in myself and in everybody else. So,

1552
01:19:32.430 --> 01:19:35.229
there's a, there's a, there's an organizing idea that

1553
01:19:35.229 --> 01:19:37.870
is external, that is kind of political almost, right?

1554
01:19:38.089 --> 01:19:40.310
It's a, it's an idea about, I, I need

1555
01:19:40.310 --> 01:19:43.750
to help organize my society so that it contributes

1556
01:19:43.750 --> 01:19:47.810
to My own genius and the genius of others,

1557
01:19:48.080 --> 01:19:50.740
right? And the realization of the genius of others,

1558
01:19:51.060 --> 01:19:56.790
um, so that, uh Uh, and in doing that,

1559
01:19:56.810 --> 01:19:59.209
I become whole, right? I become a, a, a,

1560
01:19:59.290 --> 01:20:03.589
a whole human being, a complete human being, yeah,

1561
01:20:05.410 --> 01:20:07.290
cause maybe I said too much. So, OK,

1562
01:20:07.410 --> 01:20:10.049
so let me ask you now, I, I guess

1563
01:20:10.049 --> 01:20:14.410
that following up on this bit about wholeness, what

1564
01:20:14.410 --> 01:20:18.609
is the paths of distance in Nietzsche, and does

1565
01:20:18.609 --> 01:20:21.850
it involve contempt toward the common men?

1566
01:20:23.089 --> 01:20:25.089
Yeah, so, I mean, I, I, I have a,

1567
01:20:25.149 --> 01:20:28.040
a, a, a shorter essay on this where I'm,

1568
01:20:28.120 --> 01:20:30.479
uh, I'm actually arguing a little bit against uh

1569
01:20:30.479 --> 01:20:33.129
Alfano's uh position and description of the pathos of

1570
01:20:33.129 --> 01:20:36.370
distance as a pathos that involves a virtue of

1571
01:20:36.370 --> 01:20:42.890
essentializing contempt against the, the, um, uh, uh, lower

1572
01:20:42.890 --> 01:20:45.250
man, right, on the part of the, of the

1573
01:20:45.250 --> 01:20:51.870
noble, uh, person. So, er, now, so. 11 thing

1574
01:20:51.870 --> 01:20:53.540
to say is there's not a lot of passages

1575
01:20:53.540 --> 01:20:56.470
that discuss the paths of distance in Nietzsche's published

1576
01:20:56.470 --> 01:20:59.069
work, right? There's like, like 5 or something like

1577
01:20:59.069 --> 01:21:03.169
that. One in uh uh Antichrist, but the important

1578
01:21:03.169 --> 01:21:05.810
ones, I guess, or more important ones uh are

1579
01:21:05.810 --> 01:21:08.459
the ones that happen in genealogy and in, uh,

1580
01:21:08.470 --> 01:21:11.109
in Beyond Good and Evil. And what he says

1581
01:21:11.109 --> 01:21:12.830
in Beyond Good and Evil in particular is that

1582
01:21:13.109 --> 01:21:23.000
the patterns of distance is, um, Um Socio-political, uh,

1583
01:21:24.279 --> 01:21:28.680
Pathos that exists in aristocratic societies in and in

1584
01:21:28.680 --> 01:21:33.680
healthy aristocratic societies when this uh pathos exists, Nietzsche

1585
01:21:33.680 --> 01:21:36.799
also says it generates or it contributes to the,

1586
01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:41.439
to the, uh, formation of another pathos which is

1587
01:21:41.439 --> 01:21:45.279
the internal pathos, right, the pathos of inner distance

1588
01:21:45.279 --> 01:21:48.040
he calls it, which he also says is the

1589
01:21:48.040 --> 01:21:51.879
pathos of self-overcoming. So the individual starts to look

1590
01:21:51.879 --> 01:21:57.160
for er. In the way he describes it, I,

1591
01:21:57.319 --> 01:21:59.439
you know, I'm trying to remember from memory, but

1592
01:21:59.439 --> 01:22:03.520
he's saying something like, uh, finding distances with within

1593
01:22:03.520 --> 01:22:06.240
the soul, finding spiritual states that are rare, that

1594
01:22:06.240 --> 01:22:09.919
are high, that are, you know, uh, unique, right,

1595
01:22:09.959 --> 01:22:12.549
and all that stuff, right, ennobling yourself, you know,

1596
01:22:13.240 --> 01:22:19.000
ennobling, enhancing your spiritual states. Now, there's some relation

1597
01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:22.299
then between having a pathos of distance between classes,

1598
01:22:22.600 --> 01:22:29.029
the noble class uh portrays this pathos towards the

1599
01:22:29.040 --> 01:22:31.120
lower class and, you know, it's interesting that it's

1600
01:22:31.120 --> 01:22:33.220
a pathos because, you know, pathos is like, um,

1601
01:22:33.919 --> 01:22:35.759
this, this is a, a, a, a term used

1602
01:22:35.759 --> 01:22:40.580
in, in a theater context in, in particular, right?

1603
01:22:40.640 --> 01:22:44.560
When, when the, the, the, the, or actor kind

1604
01:22:44.560 --> 01:22:47.459
of You know, takes on a pathos that then

1605
01:22:47.459 --> 01:22:51.100
is meant to evoke or elicit in the audience

1606
01:22:51.399 --> 01:22:55.399
feelings of pity and compassion, typically, right? Nietzsche is,

1607
01:22:55.430 --> 01:22:58.439
of course, twisting, is saying, the, the novel adopts

1608
01:22:58.439 --> 01:23:01.540
this pathos that then presumably elicits in the Uh,

1609
01:23:01.640 --> 01:23:05.560
no, in the, in the, uh, common man, uh,

1610
01:23:05.720 --> 01:23:08.089
the feelings of distance, right? There is a distance

1611
01:23:08.089 --> 01:23:11.100
between me and this noble, right? The novel is,

1612
01:23:11.399 --> 01:23:14.640
uh, uh situated in a different place from me,

1613
01:23:14.750 --> 01:23:16.799
from the rest of us, right? That seems to

1614
01:23:16.799 --> 01:23:20.910
be, um. And then the issue is, OK, what

1615
01:23:20.910 --> 01:23:24.069
is the, how is it that this pathos generates

1616
01:23:24.069 --> 01:23:27.069
these other pathos, the internal pathos of distance, right?

1617
01:23:27.270 --> 01:23:30.180
Uh, Nietzsche says, this other pathos of distance, this,

1618
01:23:30.270 --> 01:23:34.109
this, trying to ennoble yourself is a, is a

1619
01:23:34.109 --> 01:23:36.990
pathos that gets generated only in aris we think

1620
01:23:36.990 --> 01:23:39.149
with the help of aristocratic societies. That's the way

1621
01:23:39.149 --> 01:23:41.060
it has always been and will always be. So,

1622
01:23:41.069 --> 01:23:45.209
it's very linked in Nietzsche's. Uh, OWN estimation with

1623
01:23:45.209 --> 01:23:48.529
aristocratic forms of government, OK? Because in aristocratic forms

1624
01:23:48.529 --> 01:23:54.129
of government, the socio-political pathos is the one that

1625
01:23:54.129 --> 01:23:58.689
eventually provokes in the population, by the way, the

1626
01:23:58.689 --> 01:24:02.009
population, not just, uh, I take it means the,

1627
01:24:02.129 --> 01:24:04.529
the, the slaves and the nobles, right? Or the,

1628
01:24:04.680 --> 01:24:06.939
the, the plebeians and the nobles, in both of

1629
01:24:06.939 --> 01:24:10.209
them, it provokes this inner pathos of distance, right?

1630
01:24:10.509 --> 01:24:12.310
And so, one question is, well, how is it

1631
01:24:12.310 --> 01:24:15.629
that this is working? Why is it that noble

1632
01:24:15.629 --> 01:24:19.890
societies, uh, or aristocratic societies as Nietzsche conceives them,

1633
01:24:19.990 --> 01:24:23.279
would generate these internal pathos of distance in, in

1634
01:24:23.279 --> 01:24:27.060
the individuals living in this society. And My answer

1635
01:24:27.060 --> 01:24:28.740
to that question is to say that the distance

1636
01:24:28.740 --> 01:24:30.819
is not just a matter of superiority or power

1637
01:24:30.819 --> 01:24:34.939
relations, right? That the noble is situated over here

1638
01:24:34.939 --> 01:24:37.560
and he commands, and he tells the, the plebeian

1639
01:24:37.560 --> 01:24:39.419
what to do and everybody else what to do,

1640
01:24:39.620 --> 01:24:41.680
and that, that, and that he keeps them away

1641
01:24:41.680 --> 01:24:44.220
and, and he, you know, keeps them enslaved and

1642
01:24:44.220 --> 01:24:46.779
as tools for his plans and all that stuff.

1643
01:24:46.939 --> 01:24:48.850
It's not just about that, it, it includes that,

1644
01:24:48.939 --> 01:24:51.100
but, but it's not just about that. It's about

1645
01:24:51.100 --> 01:24:54.500
the significance that the figure of the noble has.

1646
01:24:54.910 --> 01:24:57.430
In the eyes of himself and society and, and

1647
01:24:57.430 --> 01:25:00.660
the, and, and even the plebeian person. The significance

1648
01:25:00.660 --> 01:25:04.109
is that the novel represents the highest power and

1649
01:25:04.109 --> 01:25:07.830
splendor possible for the human type, OK? He represents

1650
01:25:07.830 --> 01:25:12.149
true nobility, OK? Obviously, he's supposed to represent true

1651
01:25:12.149 --> 01:25:16.189
nobility in healthy aristocracies, because Nietzsche is also very

1652
01:25:16.189 --> 01:25:18.149
careful, right? I mean, in Beyond Good and Evil,

1653
01:25:18.189 --> 01:25:20.129
he ends Beyond Good and Evil by telling you

1654
01:25:20.339 --> 01:25:22.490
what is noble, right? It's a section that says

1655
01:25:22.680 --> 01:25:24.830
what is noble. And it turns out when you

1656
01:25:24.830 --> 01:25:26.790
read that section that what is noble is, it's

1657
01:25:26.790 --> 01:25:29.950
something very difficult to achieve, OK? Nobility is very

1658
01:25:29.950 --> 01:25:32.629
rare in some sense. So, even when you have

1659
01:25:32.629 --> 01:25:37.069
aristocratic societies, I imagine Nietzsche would say most aristocratic

1660
01:25:37.069 --> 01:25:41.759
societies are corrupt aristocratic societies. They're not true aristocratic,

1661
01:25:41.950 --> 01:25:45.109
they're not healthy aristocratic societies. They are societies like

1662
01:25:45.109 --> 01:25:48.310
the French, uh, prior to the French Revolution societies

1663
01:25:48.310 --> 01:25:51.270
where they were just libertines. To be a libertine

1664
01:25:51.270 --> 01:25:53.419
is not to be noble to Nietzsche. Again, you've

1665
01:25:53.419 --> 01:25:57.759
got to fight that animal. Urges of just giving

1666
01:25:57.759 --> 01:26:01.359
into pleasure and excess and like living a life

1667
01:26:01.359 --> 01:26:04.000
that is just relaxed and exploiting others for the

1668
01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:06.200
sake of exploiting them and all that stuff. That's

1669
01:26:06.200 --> 01:26:10.939
not nobility for Nietzsche, OK? Um, SO, of course,

1670
01:26:11.160 --> 01:26:17.250
uh, Maybe he over-romanticizes aristocratic, uh, governments, right? But

1671
01:26:17.250 --> 01:26:18.979
we, we gotta work with what he's giving us.

1672
01:26:19.029 --> 01:26:22.189
So the idea is in a healthy, in a

1673
01:26:22.189 --> 01:26:26.950
true, in a genuine aristocracy, the aristocrat represents, actually

1674
01:26:26.950 --> 01:26:31.169
represents a person who is spiritually deep, who's spiritually

1675
01:26:31.509 --> 01:26:35.299
genius, who's spiritually, you know, giving us laws that

1676
01:26:35.299 --> 01:26:37.790
contribute to the genius in us and in everybody

1677
01:26:37.790 --> 01:26:44.830
else, presumably, OK? In that society. The distance that

1678
01:26:44.830 --> 01:26:46.950
is generated is the distance in which the novel

1679
01:26:46.950 --> 01:26:53.149
stands out as meaning-giving. It, it justifies everything else

1680
01:26:53.149 --> 01:26:56.990
that's happening in the society, the oppressive structures that

1681
01:26:56.990 --> 01:27:00.350
are happening, the way the novel oppresses the other

1682
01:27:00.350 --> 01:27:03.790
people or whatever. All of that is justified because

1683
01:27:03.799 --> 01:27:08.439
it produces this kind of human being that As

1684
01:27:08.439 --> 01:27:11.879
Nietzsche eloquently puts it, uh, restores our trust in

1685
01:27:11.879 --> 01:27:14.680
the future, in ourselves, in humanity, right? I mean,

1686
01:27:14.790 --> 01:27:17.020
he, he uses this kind of language, right? So,

1687
01:27:17.410 --> 01:27:20.879
OK, so you're producing beings that res restore our

1688
01:27:20.879 --> 01:27:23.379
trust in humanity and in ourselves and in everything.

1689
01:27:23.879 --> 01:27:27.580
No wonder that this kind of arrangement starts to

1690
01:27:28.359 --> 01:27:32.060
reflect back in me, into my psyche. By way

1691
01:27:32.060 --> 01:27:34.040
of demanding that I try to do the same,

1692
01:27:34.160 --> 01:27:35.919
that I try to become a genius, right? I

1693
01:27:35.919 --> 01:27:38.479
should do, I should become a noble aristocrat too.

1694
01:27:38.560 --> 01:27:42.040
I should try to ennoble my inner states as

1695
01:27:42.040 --> 01:27:45.720
much as I can, OK? Uh, I should seek

1696
01:27:45.720 --> 01:27:49.319
within myself the deepening of my soul, the deepening

1697
01:27:49.319 --> 01:27:52.839
of my spirit, of my intellect in the right

1698
01:27:52.839 --> 01:27:57.509
way, right? I should Fight against my animality and,

1699
01:27:57.589 --> 01:28:00.109
and, and for the late Nietzsche and certainly for

1700
01:28:00.109 --> 01:28:02.470
the Nietzsche of Beyond good and evil, against my

1701
01:28:02.470 --> 01:28:03.870
humanity, that's why I have to be beyond good

1702
01:28:03.870 --> 01:28:05.990
and evil. I have to be beyond morality a

1703
01:28:05.990 --> 01:28:07.339
little bit, which is the thing that makes me

1704
01:28:07.339 --> 01:28:10.250
human, right? Because part of what happened to Nietzsche

1705
01:28:10.250 --> 01:28:12.430
was he realized that the ideal of the genius

1706
01:28:12.430 --> 01:28:18.750
is easily corrupted, easily corruptible by My humanity, by,

1707
01:28:18.850 --> 01:28:21.029
by, by, by the aspects of my, my morality,

1708
01:28:21.109 --> 01:28:24.009
by, by the aspects of my humanity that could

1709
01:28:24.549 --> 01:28:28.470
uh stand in the way of the completion of

1710
01:28:28.470 --> 01:28:30.910
my humanity, the realization of my humanity in the

1711
01:28:30.910 --> 01:28:33.669
form of sovereignty, for instance, right? This is one

1712
01:28:33.669 --> 01:28:35.629
of the things he realizes early on in his,

1713
01:28:35.790 --> 01:28:37.350
and this is part of what, this is why

1714
01:28:37.350 --> 01:28:39.680
his next book is Human All Too Human. Right,

1715
01:28:39.729 --> 01:28:41.680
he's trying to figure out what are these human

1716
01:28:41.680 --> 01:28:45.319
all too human parts of my humanity that are

1717
01:28:45.319 --> 01:28:47.959
keeping me, that are, that are standing in the

1718
01:28:47.959 --> 01:28:50.799
way and that keep pinning me down to my

1719
01:28:50.799 --> 01:28:54.359
animality even to make me revert back into the

1720
01:28:54.359 --> 01:28:58.535
animal, belittle myself. Humiliate myself, humiliate my humanity to

1721
01:28:58.535 --> 01:29:00.975
the point of destroying it and all that stuff.

1722
01:29:01.174 --> 01:29:04.245
What are those parts? Oh, it's morality, right? It's

1723
01:29:04.245 --> 01:29:07.935
Christ Judo-Christian morality in particular, right? Especially, it's the

1724
01:29:07.935 --> 01:29:10.375
ascetic ideal, it's all those things. Those are the

1725
01:29:10.375 --> 01:29:13.294
things that stand in the way. OK, I gotta

1726
01:29:13.294 --> 01:29:17.174
overcome my humanity now, overcome those aspects, and hence,

1727
01:29:17.455 --> 01:29:21.134
the superhuman becomes the ideal, right? Let's overcome humanity.

1728
01:29:21.214 --> 01:29:25.279
Let's be superhuman now. So, And, and, and that's

1729
01:29:25.279 --> 01:29:26.839
what there are two strains in ways he's doing,

1730
01:29:26.919 --> 01:29:30.049
right? So, so I think um We need to

1731
01:29:30.049 --> 01:29:33.729
overcome our animality and our humanity, and this is

1732
01:29:33.729 --> 01:29:36.529
to ennoble ourselves, and Nietzsche thinks this is done

1733
01:29:36.529 --> 01:29:39.569
in a, in a healthy aristocratic society because it

1734
01:29:39.569 --> 01:29:41.970
has the pathos of distance, OK, and it's gonna

1735
01:29:41.970 --> 01:29:45.410
inject in us the pathos, uh, of distance in

1736
01:29:45.410 --> 01:29:47.419
some sense, in our souls, yeah,

1737
01:29:48.169 --> 01:29:51.189
OK, so I have just one last question then.

1738
01:29:51.569 --> 01:29:55.185
Is this pathos of distance since you Say it

1739
01:29:55.185 --> 01:29:58.095
would occur in an aristocratic society. Is it in

1740
01:29:58.095 --> 01:30:03.294
any way compatible with democracy, and what were Nietzsche's

1741
01:30:03.294 --> 01:30:05.384
more general ideas about democracy?

1742
01:30:05.584 --> 01:30:06.944
Yeah, I, I haven't done a lot of work.

1743
01:30:07.024 --> 01:30:10.625
There are good people doing work on Nietzsche's politics,

1744
01:30:10.634 --> 01:30:13.254
uh, that, that, you know, you should speak to,

1745
01:30:13.345 --> 01:30:18.100
uh, for this, for this, uh. Uh, QUESTION in

1746
01:30:18.100 --> 01:30:19.979
particular, but, you know, I, I haven't done a

1747
01:30:19.979 --> 01:30:23.140
lot of work on Nietzsche's political views really other

1748
01:30:23.140 --> 01:30:26.990
than these patterns of distance paper, but, uh, But

1749
01:30:26.990 --> 01:30:28.310
I mean, there, there are some things to say.

1750
01:30:28.350 --> 01:30:34.290
Obviously, Nietzsche had very uh precarious models of what

1751
01:30:34.620 --> 01:30:39.350
democracy, uh, you know, uh looks like or what

1752
01:30:39.350 --> 01:30:42.910
democracy is, right? He has the, the United States,

1753
01:30:43.029 --> 01:30:45.470
the oldest modern democracy, but that's like born in

1754
01:30:45.470 --> 01:30:47.470
a contradiction even, right? I mean, it's born in

1755
01:30:47.470 --> 01:30:50.069
white supremacy and like. All sorts of things that

1756
01:30:50.410 --> 01:30:53.370
contradict the very ideals that the democracy is supposedly

1757
01:30:53.370 --> 01:30:56.770
founded on. So, you know, like, uh, equality and

1758
01:30:56.770 --> 01:31:00.129
freedom and all those things that typi typify democratic

1759
01:31:00.129 --> 01:31:02.810
uh governments, right? A democracy is the government of

1760
01:31:02.810 --> 01:31:04.890
the people, by the people, for the people, so

1761
01:31:04.890 --> 01:31:08.330
that all the people can, You know, uh, uh,

1762
01:31:08.720 --> 01:31:13.000
increase their welfare, right? Their happiness, and, uh, their

1763
01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:15.319
conceptions of the good can coexist with each other,

1764
01:31:15.439 --> 01:31:18.279
can be, you know, uh, uh, can, can be

1765
01:31:18.279 --> 01:31:22.709
pursued, uh, without interfering with each other. Um, THAT'S

1766
01:31:22.709 --> 01:31:25.310
basically an idealized version of what a democracy should

1767
01:31:25.310 --> 01:31:28.149
be, but actual democracies are a mess, right, as

1768
01:31:28.149 --> 01:31:31.359
we know, right? And they're under threat nowadays. So,

1769
01:31:31.470 --> 01:31:33.270
you know, so it's a, it's a, it's, it's

1770
01:31:33.270 --> 01:31:36.000
a complicated thing. Nietzsche didn't really have even the

1771
01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:39.189
modern democracies that we have now where we could

1772
01:31:39.189 --> 01:31:41.379
see that maybe there are ways of handling some,

1773
01:31:41.609 --> 01:31:45.270
some of the issues that democracies, uh, uh, present.

1774
01:31:45.509 --> 01:31:48.669
So, his model is very precarious. He's convinced, of

1775
01:31:48.669 --> 01:31:51.350
course, he's, he presents himself as a radical aristocrat.

1776
01:31:51.700 --> 01:31:57.750
Um, AND, uh, As somebody who's pro-aristocracy, uh, aristocratic

1777
01:31:57.750 --> 01:32:01.379
forms of government, so he's very much against, uh,

1778
01:32:01.390 --> 01:32:05.310
democracy. It's a question whether he would accept that

1779
01:32:05.310 --> 01:32:08.939
you could produce the pathos of distance in a

1780
01:32:08.939 --> 01:32:12.310
democracy or not, OK? Because he's not, you know,

1781
01:32:12.390 --> 01:32:14.250
he's not thinking in those categories. He's not even,

1782
01:32:14.390 --> 01:32:17.299
you know, contemplating the possibility, I don't think. So,

1783
01:32:17.370 --> 01:32:19.609
it's a question for us, right? The question is,

1784
01:32:20.270 --> 01:32:22.910
Could we take this element if we think that

1785
01:32:22.910 --> 01:32:26.669
it's a valuable element in Nietzsche's philosophy and adapt

1786
01:32:26.669 --> 01:32:28.990
it to our democracies, right? And, and, and, and,

1787
01:32:29.129 --> 01:32:33.189
and, and make our democracies kind of uh organize

1788
01:32:33.189 --> 01:32:36.209
our democracies in such a way that we could

1789
01:32:36.589 --> 01:32:41.410
perhaps potentially um Uh, provoke the pathos of distance,

1790
01:32:41.529 --> 01:32:44.129
the enhancement of the human being in all our

1791
01:32:44.129 --> 01:32:46.410
citizens, right, or in, in, in, in our, in

1792
01:32:46.410 --> 01:32:48.450
our citizens or in the majority of them or

1793
01:32:48.450 --> 01:32:51.609
whatever. Help to help our citizens to see themselves

1794
01:32:51.609 --> 01:32:54.290
as somebody that is tasked with the, with the

1795
01:32:54.290 --> 01:32:58.520
issue of ennobling themselves, uh, of, of trying to

1796
01:32:58.529 --> 01:33:00.770
contribute to the ennoblement of the human being and

1797
01:33:00.770 --> 01:33:03.609
whatever else, um. That's a question for us. And,

1798
01:33:03.689 --> 01:33:06.049
and there, I don't know, I, I don't know

1799
01:33:06.049 --> 01:33:09.410
how I feel about uh what answer to give

1800
01:33:09.410 --> 01:33:11.569
because, um, I mean, to some extent, I think,

1801
01:33:11.649 --> 01:33:13.970
yes, we can, right? I mean, it's not, it

1802
01:33:13.970 --> 01:33:18.729
doesn't seem incompatible in any fundamental way with, um,

1803
01:33:18.740 --> 01:33:22.270
you know, uh, democracy, that we could, in fact,

1804
01:33:22.410 --> 01:33:26.009
organize our societies such that we're not just interested

1805
01:33:26.009 --> 01:33:28.799
in the welfare of the human being, And in

1806
01:33:28.799 --> 01:33:32.799
the conception of the good understood uh as very

1807
01:33:32.799 --> 01:33:36.560
personalistic, uh, conceptions of the good as coexisting which

1808
01:33:36.560 --> 01:33:38.600
is human, but that we could even give them

1809
01:33:38.600 --> 01:33:41.600
more, uh, ambitious goals, right, that the human beings

1810
01:33:41.600 --> 01:33:43.919
should have the ambitious goal of contributing to the

1811
01:33:43.919 --> 01:33:46.399
enhancement of the human being and the noblement of

1812
01:33:46.399 --> 01:33:48.080
the human being and the, the being that is

1813
01:33:48.080 --> 01:33:50.959
constantly working on itself and trying to become not

1814
01:33:50.959 --> 01:33:56.430
better, better, but, but, but nobler, right? Mhm. Higher,

1815
01:33:56.649 --> 01:33:59.640
finding rare states in himself, higher states in himself,

1816
01:33:59.720 --> 01:34:02.200
all this description that he's giving you there, OK?

1817
01:34:02.560 --> 01:34:05.680
I don't think there's anything inherently that, that would

1818
01:34:05.680 --> 01:34:08.120
stand in the way of that, especially because the

1819
01:34:08.120 --> 01:34:10.990
pathos of, uh, of distance, although it involves a

1820
01:34:10.990 --> 01:34:13.919
kind of contempt towards the, the person who's lower,

1821
01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:16.640
the person who's not ennobled, right? The person who's

1822
01:34:16.640 --> 01:34:19.919
not noble, who's too vulgar, who's like trying to

1823
01:34:19.919 --> 01:34:22.000
be a libertine or whatever, trying to give in

1824
01:34:22.000 --> 01:34:25.669
to his animal side, um. It involves a contempt

1825
01:34:25.669 --> 01:34:27.310
towards that from the point of view, from the

1826
01:34:27.310 --> 01:34:29.069
vantage point of the person who is trying to

1827
01:34:29.069 --> 01:34:32.459
ennoble himself. But it's not an essentializing contempt. It's

1828
01:34:32.459 --> 01:34:34.910
not a contempt that says, oh, you are vulgar

1829
01:34:34.910 --> 01:34:37.589
and there's no rede there's no redemption for you.

1830
01:34:37.669 --> 01:34:39.229
You are gonna be vulgar for the rest of

1831
01:34:39.229 --> 01:34:42.990
your life. You are just vulgar, period, right? Some

1832
01:34:42.990 --> 01:34:47.270
kind of essentially causally deterministic picture of like human

1833
01:34:47.270 --> 01:34:50.310
beings. No, the process of distance incorporates, as, as

1834
01:34:50.310 --> 01:34:53.279
you said, you know. The sovereign individual, certainly, presumably,

1835
01:34:53.359 --> 01:34:55.759
it incorporates this idea of, you are free, we

1836
01:34:55.759 --> 01:34:57.549
are free as noble, right? I can be a

1837
01:34:57.549 --> 01:34:59.540
master of a free will. So I can change

1838
01:34:59.540 --> 01:35:02.319
that. I can work on myself. I can try

1839
01:35:02.319 --> 01:35:06.680
to become spiritually more elevated, OK? Um, ANYBODY can.

1840
01:35:06.879 --> 01:35:09.439
And maybe if these vulgar people are not doing

1841
01:35:09.439 --> 01:35:11.319
it, it's because something in my society is not

1842
01:35:11.319 --> 01:35:14.450
working. Right, to make those people see that they

1843
01:35:14.450 --> 01:35:17.549
could do that. Maybe I should change my ins

1844
01:35:17.549 --> 01:35:19.819
institutions of higher learning, so that, you know, people

1845
01:35:19.819 --> 01:35:22.620
don't just think of their education as, oh, I,

1846
01:35:22.899 --> 01:35:24.540
I, I need to go to school to get

1847
01:35:24.540 --> 01:35:27.060
a diploma to get a job, OK? And that's

1848
01:35:27.060 --> 01:35:30.100
what I'm doing here in this higher, higher education

1849
01:35:30.100 --> 01:35:31.859
place. No, maybe I should go to the school

1850
01:35:31.859 --> 01:35:35.600
to Improve myself to like, learn things about myself,

1851
01:35:35.680 --> 01:35:38.620
to like, transform my being, to learn for the

1852
01:35:38.620 --> 01:35:42.560
sake of learning, and not, you know, uh for

1853
01:35:42.560 --> 01:35:44.240
the sake of getting a job or getting a

1854
01:35:44.240 --> 01:35:47.700
title or not this transactional way in which we've

1855
01:35:48.520 --> 01:35:52.689
Conceived of the, the higher educational system, right? This

1856
01:35:52.689 --> 01:35:55.540
kind of capitalistic way of thinking about education. No,

1857
01:35:55.799 --> 01:35:57.629
let's do the novel way of thinking about education.

1858
01:35:57.709 --> 01:36:00.879
Maybe that can help. Um, NOW, again, this is

1859
01:36:00.879 --> 01:36:02.359
something that we can do. I don't think, I

1860
01:36:02.359 --> 01:36:03.879
don't know if Nietzsche would have, would be on

1861
01:36:03.879 --> 01:36:08.100
board. Probably not. OK. Nietzsche's dangerous. He's a, he,

1862
01:36:08.229 --> 01:36:11.200
he, because there are, of course, uh, precisely because

1863
01:36:11.200 --> 01:36:14.120
he's a critic of democracy, um, we have to

1864
01:36:14.120 --> 01:36:17.100
recognize that there are And because he talks about

1865
01:36:17.100 --> 01:36:20.379
power and because he's anti-egalitarian, and because we have

1866
01:36:20.379 --> 01:36:22.740
to recognize that there are many elements in Nietzsche

1867
01:36:22.740 --> 01:36:25.299
that are proto-fascistic, even if it, it would be

1868
01:36:25.299 --> 01:36:29.660
a complete, uh, I think, uh, uh, twisting of

1869
01:36:29.660 --> 01:36:33.490
Nietzsche's philosophy to align him with fascistic, uh, uh,

1870
01:36:33.500 --> 01:36:37.100
ideology, OK? Um, BECAUSE he, there are many things

1871
01:36:37.100 --> 01:36:41.379
that he would, uh, be mortified about, um, if

1872
01:36:41.379 --> 01:36:44.240
he were aligned with that, right? Most fascists are

1873
01:36:44.303 --> 01:36:47.882
Just vulgar libertines, right, for him. That, that they're

1874
01:36:47.882 --> 01:36:50.853
not noble, they don't represent nobility at all, so

1875
01:36:50.853 --> 01:36:52.962
they are not really, it would be terrible. It

1876
01:36:52.962 --> 01:36:54.772
was just power for the sake of power and

1877
01:36:54.772 --> 01:36:57.172
they are just, you know, in it for themselves

1878
01:36:57.172 --> 01:37:01.493
and all that stuff. So, horrible, no way Nietzsche

1879
01:37:01.493 --> 01:37:03.493
would have been in on board with fascistic policies,

1880
01:37:03.612 --> 01:37:05.772
but Nietzsche is a guy who talks about power.

1881
01:37:05.893 --> 01:37:08.882
Nietzsche is a guy who talks about inequalities and

1882
01:37:08.936 --> 01:37:11.335
Hierarchies. He's a guy who talks about, uh, you

1883
01:37:11.335 --> 01:37:14.255
know, he's misogyny a little bit, right? He's, he,

1884
01:37:14.536 --> 01:37:16.166
he seems to have a, a little hatred of

1885
01:37:16.166 --> 01:37:18.576
women or certainly he's not on board with the

1886
01:37:18.576 --> 01:37:21.016
equality of women and, and stuff. He's not on

1887
01:37:21.016 --> 01:37:24.445
board with universal education either, right? He's like, he

1888
01:37:24.445 --> 01:37:27.576
wanted, uh, the, the institutions to not to open

1889
01:37:27.576 --> 01:37:32.206
up to, to allow people from all socioeconomic backgrounds

1890
01:37:32.206 --> 01:37:35.080
to come to the university. Um, RIGHT? He, he,

1891
01:37:35.200 --> 01:37:37.839
he thought he was an elitist, right? And so,

1892
01:37:37.919 --> 01:37:40.720
yeah, so, so it's a very dangerous, he, he

1893
01:37:40.720 --> 01:37:42.279
himself owned up to it, where he says, I,

1894
01:37:42.359 --> 01:37:44.399
I'm not a man, I'm dynamite. So, yeah, you

1895
01:37:44.399 --> 01:37:46.549
gotta handle him with a lot of care, right?

1896
01:37:46.959 --> 01:37:48.799
Because there are elements in each that can be

1897
01:37:48.799 --> 01:37:52.279
exploited in the, in the service of a very

1898
01:37:52.279 --> 01:37:56.870
fascistic, anti-democratic, uh, Form of government. But maybe there

1899
01:37:56.870 --> 01:37:59.910
are elements that can be used within democracy and,

1900
01:37:59.970 --> 01:38:02.069
and with democratic ways of thinking. And I think

1901
01:38:02.069 --> 01:38:05.270
this is, I don't see, of course, without having

1902
01:38:05.270 --> 01:38:09.509
analyzed it deeply, right? I don't see any reason

1903
01:38:09.509 --> 01:38:15.189
why democracies could not incorporate uh among the, the,

1904
01:38:15.290 --> 01:38:18.129
the things that they do. A, a way of

1905
01:38:18.129 --> 01:38:21.729
trying to encourage people in their, the citizens in

1906
01:38:21.729 --> 01:38:27.509
their, in their um societies to Adopt the pathos

1907
01:38:27.509 --> 01:38:30.149
of distance, to try to ennoble themselves, to try

1908
01:38:30.149 --> 01:38:34.990
to collaborate. In a project of ennobling humanity as

1909
01:38:34.990 --> 01:38:38.899
a whole, right? Um, I think they they could,

1910
01:38:39.080 --> 01:38:42.450
right? um. So yeah, that would be my answer.

1911
01:38:43.450 --> 01:38:46.490
OK, great. So let's send on that note then,

1912
01:38:46.609 --> 01:38:48.569
Doctor Zamos Gregueros. Uh,

1913
01:38:48.720 --> 01:38:49.209
PEOPLE are,

1914
01:38:49.370 --> 01:38:52.529
if people are interested, where can they find your

1915
01:38:52.529 --> 01:38:53.569
work on the

1916
01:38:53.569 --> 01:38:56.270
internet? You can find most of my, uh, work

1917
01:38:56.270 --> 01:38:58.770
online. Uh, I, I have, I'm not very good

1918
01:38:58.770 --> 01:39:02.089
at online presence, uh, you know, keeping a, a

1919
01:39:02.089 --> 01:39:04.689
steady online presence and stuff like that. I'm, I'm

1920
01:39:04.689 --> 01:39:07.000
kind of old fashioned a little bit, uh. In

1921
01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:10.600
this way, but, uh, you can find, uh, in

1922
01:39:10.600 --> 01:39:15.919
academia.edu, uh, some of my work that you can

1923
01:39:15.919 --> 01:39:18.910
download. You can find it in field papers. I'm

1924
01:39:18.910 --> 01:39:22.560
trying to also start to go to other, other

1925
01:39:22.560 --> 01:39:24.919
of these kinds of websites, but again, it's very

1926
01:39:24.919 --> 01:39:27.520
slow and I haven't been very proactive at, at,

1927
01:39:27.640 --> 01:39:29.240
at doing it in the right way. But you,

1928
01:39:29.359 --> 01:39:32.459
you, you'll find If you Google my name, you'll

1929
01:39:32.459 --> 01:39:35.540
probably find uh my work and can download it

1930
01:39:35.540 --> 01:39:37.580
for, for the most part for reading.

1931
01:39:37.700 --> 01:39:40.419
OK, great. So thank you so much for taking
