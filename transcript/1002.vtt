Hello, everybody. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:03.069 --> 00:00:05.710
Decent. I'm your host as always Ricard Lobs. And

3
00:00:05.719 --> 00:00:08.489
today I'm joined by Zion Lights. She is a

4
00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:11.609
science communicator, the author of the Ultimate Guide to

5
00:00:11.619 --> 00:00:15.539
Green Parenting and only a moment, founder of Emergency

6
00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:20.100
Reactor, former editor of the Hourglass newspaper and former

7
00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:23.870
spokesperson for Extinction Rebellion. And today we're going to

8
00:00:23.879 --> 00:00:27.200
talk a little bit about extinction rebellion, climate change,

9
00:00:27.209 --> 00:00:31.479
clean energy, ethical Parenting. So Z and welcome to

10
00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:33.040
the show, it's a pleasure to everyone.

11
00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:35.119
Hi, thanks for having me.

12
00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:39.659
So tell us first about extinction rebellion. So, uh

13
00:00:39.669 --> 00:00:43.560
how did you get involved with them? And perhaps,

14
00:00:43.569 --> 00:00:45.659
uh I mean, tell us a little bit about

15
00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.909
uh that bit of your story and then we

16
00:00:48.919 --> 00:00:51.689
might get a little bit into why you left

17
00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:55.110
the organization. And what are your general thoughts about

18
00:00:55.119 --> 00:00:55.349
it?

19
00:00:55.654 --> 00:00:57.014
Well, I was involved in quite a lot of

20
00:00:57.025 --> 00:00:59.544
different environmental groups from quite a young age. Um

21
00:00:59.555 --> 00:01:02.974
BECAUSE I, I really cared about, you know, deforestation

22
00:01:02.985 --> 00:01:05.525
and climate change and all these different issues. Um

23
00:01:05.535 --> 00:01:08.985
But I became very disillusioned with them particularly because

24
00:01:08.995 --> 00:01:10.974
um I felt that they were putting feelings before

25
00:01:10.985 --> 00:01:15.404
facts in a lot of instances. And, um, yeah,

26
00:01:15.415 --> 00:01:18.334
I ended up leaving numerous different groups actually and

27
00:01:18.345 --> 00:01:20.565
just sort of going my own way. Um, SO

28
00:01:20.574 --> 00:01:22.764
winning six year rebellion was founded here in, in

29
00:01:22.775 --> 00:01:25.989
Britain initially. I just, I ignored them. You know,

30
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.720
I thought it's just going to be the same

31
00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:31.279
old thing. Um, YOU know, I'm, I'm done doing

32
00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:32.739
this, I've been doing, I was doing this 10

33
00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:35.750
years ago, but they, they were very popular here.

34
00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:38.510
They're very successful. They, you know, initially they had

35
00:01:38.519 --> 00:01:40.569
really good media coverage. They had a lot of

36
00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:43.040
journalists on side, you know, they were, the messaging

37
00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:44.379
was ok. I was listening to what they were

38
00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:46.370
saying it was, it was quite positive actually at

39
00:01:46.379 --> 00:01:49.260
the beginning the movement. Um So I went to

40
00:01:49.269 --> 00:01:51.360
my local group, my local chapters to see what

41
00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:53.209
it was like. And to be honest, I felt

42
00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:54.919
that it wasn't for me. So I kind of

43
00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:56.739
turned up had a look and I, it was

44
00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:59.010
a huge meeting. There were like 100 people there.

45
00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.790
Um AT least really interested in how they could

46
00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:05.110
get involved. Um And at that point, you know,

47
00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:07.040
they were doing a lot more fun actions. It

48
00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:09.399
wasn't all blocking roads, they were quite creative. There

49
00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:10.880
was a lot of art, I thought it was

50
00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:13.649
quite positive movement. Um But I still sort of

51
00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:16.479
backed away and then I got, um, people had

52
00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:18.070
seen that I turned up and they put me

53
00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:21.009
in touch with, um, the founders basically kind of

54
00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:24.589
the core organizational group, not just a local chapter.

55
00:02:24.979 --> 00:02:28.089
And they said, look, we've seen your TED talk

56
00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:30.600
on stargazing. Would you be a spokesperson for us?

57
00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:32.229
And I kind of said, well, I've just been

58
00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:34.460
step, you know, just sort of stepped away actually.

59
00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:36.020
Um, I don't think it's for me and they

60
00:02:36.029 --> 00:02:38.850
said, well, we need someone who can do the

61
00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:40.839
communication and you'll have big TV slots. And I

62
00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:43.729
thought, well, if I don't do it, um, you

63
00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:46.289
know, they'll, they'll just have someone that doesn't represent

64
00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:48.550
the science doing it. So I, I agreed to

65
00:02:48.559 --> 00:02:50.699
do it. Um, ON that basis, I, and I

66
00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:53.809
did go down and, and join the, um, the

67
00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:58.410
Waterloo uh blockade where they, they, they blocked four

68
00:02:58.419 --> 00:03:02.160
or five different main roads in London. Um, I

69
00:03:02.169 --> 00:03:03.720
went down to have a look at that and

70
00:03:03.729 --> 00:03:05.619
it, you know, again, it was very positive movement.

71
00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:07.679
There was a lot of, um, good energy on

72
00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:09.460
the streets, there was a lot of public support

73
00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:12.940
which changed later. Um, SO onto the reasons for

74
00:03:12.949 --> 00:03:18.089
leaving. Um, YOU know, I, I basically watched them

75
00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:21.600
kind of spiral into a sort of doom, you

76
00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:24.839
know, a doomed spiral, a very negative apocalyptic view

77
00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:26.169
of the world that I would say that's not

78
00:03:26.179 --> 00:03:28.970
how they started out. Um, BUT I think those

79
00:03:28.979 --> 00:03:32.490
founders who had those opinions were pushing those views

80
00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:34.580
more and more and some of them were spokespeople.

81
00:03:34.589 --> 00:03:36.779
So I was then put in a difficult position

82
00:03:36.789 --> 00:03:39.729
of having to discuss things like the end of

83
00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:41.360
the world, you know, which I didn't want to

84
00:03:41.369 --> 00:03:42.910
have to. And I, and I would say, you

85
00:03:42.919 --> 00:03:44.410
know, on TV, I would say, wow, you know,

86
00:03:44.419 --> 00:03:46.210
that that's not true. And maybe we shouldn't have

87
00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:49.460
said that, but it, it, it, it increasingly became

88
00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:52.520
apparent that, uh, my values didn't align with the

89
00:03:52.529 --> 00:03:54.070
values of this group. So after about a year

90
00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:57.100
of doing the kind of TV slots, I felt

91
00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:00.649
that I should distance myself. Um And actually it

92
00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:04.479
was right after the, um, they did a train,

93
00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:06.639
a train action where they, they stood on several

94
00:04:06.649 --> 00:04:09.960
different trains in Britain in the underground actually on

95
00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:13.490
the tube. Um, AND some people were injured, they

96
00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:15.169
were pulled off the trains and that was kind

97
00:04:15.179 --> 00:04:16.589
of where I went. This is, you know, and

98
00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:18.100
when I spoke, I spoke to some of these

99
00:04:18.108 --> 00:04:21.309
people about that action, they said they really had

100
00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:23.829
fallen for this idea that it doesn't matter if

101
00:04:23.839 --> 00:04:25.350
we get attacked, it doesn't matter if we fall

102
00:04:25.359 --> 00:04:26.359
off the trains, it doesn't matter if people are

103
00:04:26.369 --> 00:04:28.790
late for work or lose their jobs. Climate change

104
00:04:28.799 --> 00:04:30.049
is that big a deal. And that's where I

105
00:04:30.059 --> 00:04:34.809
felt that they'd gone from being quite evidence based

106
00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:37.350
to quite cultish. And I think this can, you

107
00:04:37.359 --> 00:04:39.570
know, this can happen with any large group actually.

108
00:04:39.579 --> 00:04:44.079
I think sometimes they move so quickly. Um, PEOPLE'S

109
00:04:44.089 --> 00:04:47.029
common sense doesn't catch up with their feelings. So,

110
00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:49.450
anyway, I, yeah, so I left because my values

111
00:04:49.459 --> 00:04:50.769
didn't align with them anymore.

112
00:04:51.609 --> 00:04:54.149
But what do you mean when you say that

113
00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:58.160
over time they developed a sort of a apocalyptic

114
00:04:58.170 --> 00:05:00.480
view of the world. What does that mean?

115
00:05:00.739 --> 00:05:03.109
So, honestly, in the beginning it was so positive,

116
00:05:03.119 --> 00:05:05.670
you know, that we had good press coverage groups

117
00:05:05.679 --> 00:05:07.320
was sprung up all around the world, you know,

118
00:05:07.329 --> 00:05:09.450
and I felt like finally we can talk about

119
00:05:09.459 --> 00:05:11.739
climate change in a sensible way, we can talk

120
00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:14.160
about solutions. You know, I wanted to talk about

121
00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:17.570
things like nuclear power um uh which I couldn't

122
00:05:17.579 --> 00:05:22.130
do actually. But um yeah, I just noticed that,

123
00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:24.230
for example, there was a youth week, there was

124
00:05:24.239 --> 00:05:26.859
a very active youth wig of exus rebellion, a

125
00:05:26.869 --> 00:05:29.010
lot of young people who are concerned about climate.

126
00:05:29.019 --> 00:05:32.109
Now, for me, you know, um I would like

127
00:05:32.119 --> 00:05:34.109
to see those people have a really positive future,

128
00:05:34.119 --> 00:05:35.970
the best, the best future we can give them.

129
00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:38.070
And so I would talk to them about, you

130
00:05:38.079 --> 00:05:39.839
know, what are the solutions? How do we implement

131
00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:43.260
them? But they were very much being fed um

132
00:05:43.269 --> 00:05:46.779
a different story line by one of the, one

133
00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:49.299
of the founders actually, I would say, um and

134
00:05:49.309 --> 00:05:52.130
his followers who would say your future's been taken

135
00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:55.559
away from you. Um The world will end in

136
00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:59.920
12 years. Um THIS is, this is the fault

137
00:05:59.929 --> 00:06:06.750
of, of the current generation. Um, um, AND they've

138
00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:09.869
let you down and they should be punished even.

139
00:06:10.049 --> 00:06:11.489
Um, AND it's quite extreme. I thought it was

140
00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:13.709
quite extreme. But when I was speaking to the

141
00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:17.459
young, younger group I saw, yeah, increasingly they just

142
00:06:17.470 --> 00:06:19.790
became unreachable. You know, I started out having really

143
00:06:19.799 --> 00:06:22.799
good positive conversations and then they, the next time

144
00:06:22.809 --> 00:06:24.839
I saw them they were ranting about this is

145
00:06:24.850 --> 00:06:26.890
all, you know, this is all your fault and

146
00:06:26.899 --> 00:06:28.350
we're gonna take you down and blah, blah. And

147
00:06:28.359 --> 00:06:29.739
it was quite, it was the Greta line as

148
00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:31.119
well. Cos Greta was saying at the same time,

149
00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:32.869
you've taken my future and I was thinking you

150
00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:35.190
guys have one of the best, uh you know,

151
00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:36.989
some of the best opportunities in the world, actually

152
00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.459
very, very wealthy, live in a high income country,

153
00:06:40.470 --> 00:06:42.549
you know, um you have good education, you have

154
00:06:42.559 --> 00:06:45.850
healthcare, there's, if anything you could be talking about

155
00:06:45.859 --> 00:06:48.029
solutions and then they would say, well, that's, that's

156
00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:50.679
climate denial, that's climate denial. That's not recognizing how

157
00:06:50.690 --> 00:06:51.829
bad the problem is. But then I would say,

158
00:06:51.839 --> 00:06:53.940
well, if it's that bad and we're doomed, why

159
00:06:53.950 --> 00:06:56.429
do anything? But there was no reaching them, there

160
00:06:56.440 --> 00:06:57.829
was no reaching them. And when I saw that

161
00:06:57.839 --> 00:06:59.750
spiral and I mean, it really was quite extreme.

162
00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:00.880
There was a lot of people in those groups

163
00:07:00.890 --> 00:07:04.500
self harming, for example, they did an action um

164
00:07:04.510 --> 00:07:06.519
in London, I think it was at Westminster. I

165
00:07:06.529 --> 00:07:08.510
can't remember where it was. I mean, they did

166
00:07:08.519 --> 00:07:11.670
multiple whether they were, they were naked uh or,

167
00:07:11.679 --> 00:07:13.470
or naked from the waist up and were fully

168
00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:16.559
naked. And there were photos that came in from

169
00:07:16.570 --> 00:07:18.070
one of those actions that are, you know, they

170
00:07:18.079 --> 00:07:19.309
were sent around all of us before they go

171
00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:21.640
to press and you could see just, you know,

172
00:07:21.649 --> 00:07:23.500
cuts on their arms. I thought this was really

173
00:07:23.510 --> 00:07:25.570
extreme and they were, they just, you know, the

174
00:07:25.579 --> 00:07:28.320
media team selected the photos where you couldn't see

175
00:07:28.329 --> 00:07:30.609
the cuts. And I, and I would say to

176
00:07:30.619 --> 00:07:33.190
some of the the leaders, some of the the

177
00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:34.850
older people in the group and some of the

178
00:07:34.859 --> 00:07:38.029
founders, you know, we shouldn't be encouraging this, these

179
00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:41.690
people need help and they would say no, they're

180
00:07:41.700 --> 00:07:44.369
having an appropriate reaction to the climate emergency, which

181
00:07:44.380 --> 00:07:47.040
I don't agree with. Actually, I think that anxiety

182
00:07:47.049 --> 00:07:49.660
would exist whether or not climate change existed, you

183
00:07:49.670 --> 00:07:51.329
know, that anxiety is a problem that, that a

184
00:07:51.339 --> 00:07:53.570
lot of young people are having. And if anything,

185
00:07:53.579 --> 00:07:55.839
there were people encouraging that in, in the groups

186
00:07:55.950 --> 00:07:57.600
and the more I saw that kind of doom

187
00:07:57.609 --> 00:08:03.440
ridden, you know, uh narrative um and, and slide

188
00:08:03.450 --> 00:08:06.170
into more extreme actions like the train really just

189
00:08:06.179 --> 00:08:07.880
upset a lot of people, we went from having

190
00:08:07.890 --> 00:08:10.410
a lot of support to just and angering everybody.

191
00:08:10.779 --> 00:08:14.440
Um Yeah, I realized that somehow the balance had

192
00:08:14.450 --> 00:08:17.079
shifted and we weren't, we weren't a positive group

193
00:08:17.089 --> 00:08:19.010
anymore that wanted to see good change in the

194
00:08:19.019 --> 00:08:23.000
world. We were just, um, yeah, about apocalypse and,

195
00:08:23.010 --> 00:08:26.140
and doom and, and to me, you know, what's

196
00:08:26.149 --> 00:08:27.779
the point of any, if you really believe that?

197
00:08:27.790 --> 00:08:29.649
What's the point of doing anything? Why go block

198
00:08:29.660 --> 00:08:31.359
a road if you think the world will end

199
00:08:31.369 --> 00:08:33.979
tomorrow, what's the point? But I couldn't get through

200
00:08:33.989 --> 00:08:36.380
to people with that logic. So I, I left

201
00:08:37.859 --> 00:08:41.679
so when it comes to making people pay more

202
00:08:41.688 --> 00:08:44.669
attention to climate change, which of course is one

203
00:08:44.679 --> 00:08:47.718
of the biggest issues, if not the biggest global

204
00:08:47.729 --> 00:08:50.619
issue that we have to deal with uh at

205
00:08:50.630 --> 00:08:53.530
the moment and in the near future, I mean,

206
00:08:53.539 --> 00:08:56.200
uh I get to some extent, I get why

207
00:08:56.210 --> 00:08:59.849
would some people get desperate and uh do those

208
00:08:59.859 --> 00:09:02.330
sorts of things that you described there to get

209
00:09:02.340 --> 00:09:06.909
people's attention? But since it usually has such a

210
00:09:06.919 --> 00:09:11.510
negative impact on people in general, what they think

211
00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:14.830
about these movements, these groups, these activists, what would

212
00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:18.530
you say are perhaps or would be better ways

213
00:09:18.539 --> 00:09:22.090
of trying to get a more positive result when

214
00:09:22.099 --> 00:09:26.309
it comes to really trying to drive home the

215
00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:29.900
message that people really do have to pay attention

216
00:09:29.909 --> 00:09:30.489
to climate.

217
00:09:30.809 --> 00:09:33.210
The thing is that, that work has been done

218
00:09:33.219 --> 00:09:34.989
and that was something that extinction rebellion was good

219
00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:36.469
at, at the same time as kind of finance

220
00:09:36.479 --> 00:09:39.770
the future. And Greta's work, which was making people

221
00:09:39.780 --> 00:09:43.059
aware, but that isn't enough. Most people don't have

222
00:09:43.070 --> 00:09:44.830
a magic button that they can push and fix

223
00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:46.450
a problem. All it's done is given them a

224
00:09:46.460 --> 00:09:48.489
lot of anxiety. I'm not saying they shouldn't be

225
00:09:48.500 --> 00:09:50.229
made aware. But I think when you talk to

226
00:09:50.239 --> 00:09:52.960
people about the problems, you should always also, you

227
00:09:52.969 --> 00:09:56.119
know, include solutions. I think that's really important. Otherwise

228
00:09:56.130 --> 00:09:57.909
you're just, you know, putting a huge problem in

229
00:09:57.919 --> 00:10:00.849
someone's lap and then walking away. Um DID that

230
00:10:00.859 --> 00:10:04.380
help climate change? No, it didn't actually. Um YOU

231
00:10:04.390 --> 00:10:07.409
know, I think actually hyper focus on climate change

232
00:10:07.419 --> 00:10:09.469
is now a problem and that we should be

233
00:10:09.479 --> 00:10:12.609
really hyper focusing on what are the solutions to

234
00:10:12.619 --> 00:10:15.630
emissions and to still issues like deforestation, which are

235
00:10:15.640 --> 00:10:17.669
a big problem. Um You know, and lots of

236
00:10:17.679 --> 00:10:19.590
other issues that have have been pushed to the

237
00:10:19.599 --> 00:10:21.630
side because climate change has taken all the space.

238
00:10:21.640 --> 00:10:23.359
And now if you look at you want, if

239
00:10:23.369 --> 00:10:24.630
you want to do work in this area, it's

240
00:10:24.640 --> 00:10:27.349
all about climate and you think, well, it is

241
00:10:27.359 --> 00:10:29.219
a really important issue, but there are also lots

242
00:10:29.229 --> 00:10:31.239
of other important issues in the world that are

243
00:10:31.250 --> 00:10:34.419
now being neglected, like, you know, basic sanitation in,

244
00:10:34.429 --> 00:10:36.330
in, in some low income countries or access to

245
00:10:36.340 --> 00:10:39.739
certain technologies. Um And that sadly, you know, what,

246
00:10:39.750 --> 00:10:42.080
what it means is that because of that focus,

247
00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:44.260
a lot of the funding is just in the

248
00:10:44.270 --> 00:10:46.280
climate space and it's hard to get it now

249
00:10:46.289 --> 00:10:47.849
in other areas. And I have spoken to people

250
00:10:47.859 --> 00:10:50.359
of other groups say, you know, minority groups, if

251
00:10:50.369 --> 00:10:52.619
you like who've said this has all been sucked,

252
00:10:52.630 --> 00:10:54.520
this, all this money is being sucked up by

253
00:10:54.530 --> 00:10:58.510
this one? Cause um and you know, the problem,

254
00:10:58.520 --> 00:11:00.210
the problem that I see with it is that

255
00:11:00.219 --> 00:11:03.210
the, the cause is not focus on solutions so

256
00:11:03.219 --> 00:11:05.559
you can keep banging the same message. Fix it,

257
00:11:05.570 --> 00:11:07.469
fix it. We'll block a road if you don't

258
00:11:07.479 --> 00:11:10.989
fix it. Um But they refuse to talk about

259
00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.049
the things that actually could fix it. No one

260
00:11:13.059 --> 00:11:15.869
wants to talk about desalination, nuclear energy. I mean,

261
00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:17.679
all right, nuclear energy is much more popular now.

262
00:11:17.690 --> 00:11:19.580
But when I started out in this work a

263
00:11:19.590 --> 00:11:22.049
few years ago, I mean, I was really heavily

264
00:11:22.059 --> 00:11:24.489
attacked as an environmentalist for coming out and speaking

265
00:11:24.500 --> 00:11:26.710
out about nuclear energy has really changed a lot.

266
00:11:26.719 --> 00:11:28.140
There was not a day that went by where

267
00:11:28.150 --> 00:11:30.530
I didn't get all a shill or hate mail.

268
00:11:30.539 --> 00:11:32.890
All of that stock now. Completely stopped. So it's

269
00:11:32.900 --> 00:11:35.859
changed a lot. Um Because actually when you start

270
00:11:35.869 --> 00:11:38.059
talking about solutions, people are really keen, they want

271
00:11:38.070 --> 00:11:40.169
to hear, you know, what can we do? And

272
00:11:40.179 --> 00:11:42.559
in a way the, the environmental movement has lied

273
00:11:42.570 --> 00:11:45.669
to people, uh, you know, because they themselves have

274
00:11:45.679 --> 00:11:48.150
believed nonsense. Which is that? Oh, well, if you

275
00:11:48.159 --> 00:11:51.059
just, you know, um, turn off the tap while

276
00:11:51.070 --> 00:11:53.219
you're brushing your teeth or make sure you turn

277
00:11:53.229 --> 00:11:54.309
off the light when you leave the room, all

278
00:11:54.320 --> 00:11:56.280
the problems will be fixed. Well, yeah, sure. We

279
00:11:56.289 --> 00:11:59.619
shouldn't waste resources. I'm not disagreeing, but I don't

280
00:11:59.630 --> 00:12:01.619
think anyone really would disagree with that. Most of

281
00:12:01.630 --> 00:12:03.380
us are turning off the lights because it costs

282
00:12:03.390 --> 00:12:06.229
us money if we don't. Um, BUT frankly, we've

283
00:12:06.239 --> 00:12:09.869
been misled for decades, um, being told these are

284
00:12:09.880 --> 00:12:11.729
the solutions that will solve the problem. Well, actually

285
00:12:11.739 --> 00:12:12.880
quite a lot of us are doing that. I

286
00:12:12.890 --> 00:12:14.640
wrote an entire book on how to do that

287
00:12:14.770 --> 00:12:17.609
before. I kind of frankly just looked at the

288
00:12:17.619 --> 00:12:20.039
map and went, even if everybody does this, it

289
00:12:20.049 --> 00:12:23.250
is not going to really reduce our emissions significantly

290
00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:25.349
and nowhere near how much they need to, we

291
00:12:25.359 --> 00:12:28.250
need a big solution and that's clean energy and

292
00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:30.739
that's where I think the problem is where um

293
00:12:31.650 --> 00:12:34.270
those groups have not kind of talked about that

294
00:12:34.280 --> 00:12:35.710
and, and I've helped to talk about it and

295
00:12:35.719 --> 00:12:36.989
lots of people are now doing that, but there

296
00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:38.169
are lots of other things that we should be

297
00:12:38.179 --> 00:12:40.250
talking about, like desalination in countries that are going

298
00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:42.650
to suffer more water scarcity. Although actually, we're having

299
00:12:42.979 --> 00:12:46.479
problems here with that. Um YOU know, lots of

300
00:12:46.489 --> 00:12:48.570
different uh solutions that are out there. And I

301
00:12:48.580 --> 00:12:52.039
think if we can, you know, push the narrative

302
00:12:52.049 --> 00:12:53.799
into that, you know, take some of the funding

303
00:12:53.809 --> 00:12:56.750
away from talking about climate change and put it

304
00:12:56.760 --> 00:12:59.799
into fusion technology. For example, these are, these are

305
00:12:59.809 --> 00:13:02.960
really big solutions that could, could change everybody's life

306
00:13:02.969 --> 00:13:06.250
kind of overnight. Um As many new technologies do,

307
00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:09.780
but instead we're still just hyper focusing on what

308
00:13:09.789 --> 00:13:12.750
you do makes the biggest difference, you know, um

309
00:13:13.750 --> 00:13:17.289
small incremental changes and, and yeah, small changes can

310
00:13:17.299 --> 00:13:19.679
make a difference, you know, changing from a, a

311
00:13:19.690 --> 00:13:21.849
diesel car to an electric car that does make

312
00:13:21.859 --> 00:13:24.109
some difference. That that is an incremental improvement and

313
00:13:24.119 --> 00:13:26.570
that's something that someone can do. Um But still,

314
00:13:26.580 --> 00:13:30.090
even if we all do that, um that electricity

315
00:13:30.099 --> 00:13:32.280
comes from somewhere comes from the grid, right? And

316
00:13:32.289 --> 00:13:34.799
in the UK, that's still 60% fossil fuels. So

317
00:13:34.809 --> 00:13:37.510
again, nobody's, there's no kind of nuance in the

318
00:13:37.520 --> 00:13:40.849
debate. The slogans were very popular um in extinction

319
00:13:40.869 --> 00:13:44.260
rebellion. I helped to popularize them. Um But now

320
00:13:44.270 --> 00:13:48.489
I realize that, you know, they're problematic because they,

321
00:13:48.500 --> 00:13:51.400
they've boiled things down. So they simplified them so

322
00:13:51.409 --> 00:13:53.599
much when actually there's a really complex problem that

323
00:13:53.609 --> 00:13:57.409
involves many different um areas that need to be

324
00:13:57.419 --> 00:13:59.679
addressed, but also many different communities around the world

325
00:13:59.690 --> 00:14:01.830
who don't get a say who and who actually,

326
00:14:01.890 --> 00:14:03.390
you know, many of these people in low income

327
00:14:03.419 --> 00:14:06.130
countries are the people who will most be impacted

328
00:14:06.140 --> 00:14:07.580
by climate change. We need to be looking at

329
00:14:07.590 --> 00:14:08.919
what do they need, you know, do they need

330
00:14:08.929 --> 00:14:10.919
to build sea walls, for example, do they need

331
00:14:11.059 --> 00:14:14.299
to, to help with flood risk or better models

332
00:14:14.309 --> 00:14:16.690
for predicting weather which you know, something that is

333
00:14:16.700 --> 00:14:19.239
happening. A I is helping with that. Um But

334
00:14:19.250 --> 00:14:21.020
is there money going into that in terms of

335
00:14:21.030 --> 00:14:23.650
climate initiatives? No, no, it's not. It's it's going

336
00:14:23.659 --> 00:14:26.169
into people just speaking about the same things again

337
00:14:26.179 --> 00:14:28.450
and again, if you look at the sheer number

338
00:14:28.460 --> 00:14:30.909
of, of, of panels and things that happen on

339
00:14:30.919 --> 00:14:33.369
this and then people patting themselves on the back.

340
00:14:33.380 --> 00:14:35.830
Yeah, we had a great awareness panel about climate

341
00:14:35.840 --> 00:14:38.849
change. Awareness isn't the problem, the awareness is there,

342
00:14:38.960 --> 00:14:41.530
but awareness is not gonna do all that much

343
00:14:41.539 --> 00:14:44.669
unless it reaches the right people who understand what

344
00:14:44.679 --> 00:14:46.619
the right solutions are. And I still speak with

345
00:14:46.630 --> 00:14:48.979
politicians, you know, all over the world, not just

346
00:14:48.989 --> 00:14:52.049
here who don't understand what solutions are because they're

347
00:14:52.059 --> 00:14:54.520
not very science literate, but mostly the messaging hasn't

348
00:14:54.530 --> 00:14:56.460
reached them. So they're just, they're just stuck at

349
00:14:56.469 --> 00:14:58.309
the stage of panic or kind of going well,

350
00:14:58.320 --> 00:15:01.900
let's ignore it because it's a big insurmountable problem

351
00:15:01.909 --> 00:15:04.239
and it's not insurmountable. Actually, we have all the

352
00:15:04.250 --> 00:15:05.599
technology we need to fix it.

353
00:15:06.669 --> 00:15:08.549
So I I want to ask you more about

354
00:15:08.559 --> 00:15:11.859
the potential solutions with the focus on nuclear energy

355
00:15:11.869 --> 00:15:15.690
and also uh some other solutions that we usually

356
00:15:15.700 --> 00:15:19.929
hear from activists that perhaps have some limitations. But

357
00:15:19.940 --> 00:15:22.739
just before we get into that, as far as

358
00:15:22.750 --> 00:15:26.280
we know, according to the best cli climate science

359
00:15:26.289 --> 00:15:29.400
that we have and the best models. What would

360
00:15:29.409 --> 00:15:33.250
be some of the worst potential consequences of climate

361
00:15:33.260 --> 00:15:36.539
change for human society and the planet as a

362
00:15:36.580 --> 00:15:36.929
whole.

363
00:15:36.940 --> 00:15:39.109
So the worst, I mean, the worst model, you

364
00:15:39.119 --> 00:15:40.450
know, there's a lot, there's a lot that we

365
00:15:40.460 --> 00:15:43.090
don't know, but we know that we will have

366
00:15:43.099 --> 00:15:46.700
more unpredictable weather, more extreme weather we're seeing so

367
00:15:46.775 --> 00:15:48.445
of this in some parts of the world where

368
00:15:48.455 --> 00:15:50.804
there are, for example, more hurricanes, things like that,

369
00:15:51.034 --> 00:15:53.184
but it's very hard to actually tie them to

370
00:15:53.195 --> 00:15:55.544
climate change. All we can say is that these

371
00:15:55.554 --> 00:15:59.575
are now more common occurrences, unpredictable weather is more

372
00:15:59.585 --> 00:16:03.465
now common. Um uh Heat waves are now more

373
00:16:03.474 --> 00:16:06.525
common periods of flooding in all, you know, all

374
00:16:06.534 --> 00:16:08.835
around the world are more common and that is

375
00:16:08.844 --> 00:16:12.109
what the models predicted. So we can say, we

376
00:16:12.119 --> 00:16:14.119
said this would happen and now look it's happening

377
00:16:14.130 --> 00:16:15.549
even though a lot of people say, well, you

378
00:16:15.559 --> 00:16:18.119
can't directly tie it. Um And, but actually, you

379
00:16:18.130 --> 00:16:21.280
know, once we get more data, people will be

380
00:16:21.289 --> 00:16:22.940
scientists will be able to start tying it and

381
00:16:22.950 --> 00:16:26.179
say, well, this is really out of, you know,

382
00:16:26.190 --> 00:16:27.799
out of sync with what they were used to.

383
00:16:27.809 --> 00:16:31.979
But certainly we can say with um with climate

384
00:16:31.989 --> 00:16:33.789
change, as we used to call it global warming,

385
00:16:33.799 --> 00:16:35.270
which I think is kind of the more accurate

386
00:16:35.280 --> 00:16:38.849
term, but I I understand why it was changed.

387
00:16:39.039 --> 00:16:41.359
Um BECAUSE then people expect only a fluctuation of

388
00:16:41.369 --> 00:16:43.729
heat, but anyway. Um, WE have seen that, you

389
00:16:43.739 --> 00:16:46.440
know, we've seen that even in Britain, um, year

390
00:16:46.450 --> 00:16:49.219
on year, record highs and yeah, occasionally there'll be

391
00:16:49.229 --> 00:16:51.859
a dip but we're not measuring weather, we're measuring

392
00:16:51.869 --> 00:16:53.890
climate, which is a period of time, which is

393
00:16:53.900 --> 00:16:55.619
a lot, something, a lot of people don't understand.

394
00:16:55.630 --> 00:16:58.500
So, over a period of time it is incrementally

395
00:16:58.510 --> 00:17:01.309
getting, getting warmer and that is tied to our

396
00:17:01.320 --> 00:17:04.670
activities. I'm not even saying that's about your or

397
00:17:04.680 --> 00:17:07.069
my daily activities, which I think is where the

398
00:17:07.079 --> 00:17:09.500
messaging has gone wrong from an environmentalist kind of

399
00:17:09.510 --> 00:17:11.569
pointing fingers saying this was you, it is our

400
00:17:11.579 --> 00:17:14.189
the entire lifestyle of the world or at least

401
00:17:14.199 --> 00:17:17.439
the world that lives doesn't live in poverty. It

402
00:17:17.449 --> 00:17:20.108
is a consequence and that is measured in multiple

403
00:17:20.118 --> 00:17:23.750
different ways. Um You know, and that, that science

404
00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:25.449
is very solid and, you know, if you know

405
00:17:25.459 --> 00:17:29.410
anything about scientists, there's a lot of arguments about

406
00:17:29.420 --> 00:17:31.619
scientific consensus, right? There's a lot of, I mean,

407
00:17:31.630 --> 00:17:33.839
that's what it is. They argue about the data,

408
00:17:33.930 --> 00:17:37.020
you know, the really tiny pedantic bits of information

409
00:17:37.030 --> 00:17:38.829
until they can reach a consensus. Now for a

410
00:17:38.839 --> 00:17:41.729
lot of science, you know, it doesn't reach high

411
00:17:41.739 --> 00:17:45.439
numbers, you know, even some vaccines are 60% scientific

412
00:17:45.449 --> 00:17:47.630
consensus, you know, and I'm not saying people shouldn't

413
00:17:47.640 --> 00:17:51.020
have vaccines, I'm completely pro vaccination. But, and that's

414
00:17:51.030 --> 00:17:53.349
something that I used to work on incomes. But

415
00:17:53.359 --> 00:17:56.770
um with nuclear, you know, with, um with climate

416
00:17:56.780 --> 00:17:59.449
change, you've got the IPCC report. So the Intergovernmental

417
00:17:59.459 --> 00:18:02.250
Panel on climate change, it's an independent body. Lots

418
00:18:02.260 --> 00:18:04.560
of scientists work on that, not just climate scientists,

419
00:18:04.569 --> 00:18:07.709
but you know, um all kinds of oceanographers, geologists,

420
00:18:07.719 --> 00:18:11.089
people looking in at their fields. So what's what

421
00:18:11.099 --> 00:18:12.864
changes can we see and how do these all

422
00:18:12.875 --> 00:18:15.214
map up together to show a whole of what's

423
00:18:15.224 --> 00:18:17.724
happening to the world planet is warming, it is

424
00:18:17.734 --> 00:18:20.204
being caused by humans. But the good news is

425
00:18:20.214 --> 00:18:22.625
the report that they put out in 2018, the

426
00:18:22.635 --> 00:18:26.055
1.5 warming report, it also says we can fix

427
00:18:26.064 --> 00:18:28.555
this. And here's how and well, the problem is

428
00:18:28.564 --> 00:18:30.594
that everybody's focused on the bit where they've said

429
00:18:31.160 --> 00:18:33.479
guys, this could be really bad and they're not

430
00:18:33.489 --> 00:18:35.160
saying it will be really bad. There's, you know,

431
00:18:35.170 --> 00:18:36.890
there's leeway and they do use some of the

432
00:18:36.900 --> 00:18:40.069
worst modeling. So it might not be. But eventually,

433
00:18:40.079 --> 00:18:41.819
if the problem continues, it will still get to

434
00:18:41.829 --> 00:18:44.079
be that bad, right? So they're saying it all

435
00:18:44.089 --> 00:18:47.839
of these problems will happen. But um according to

436
00:18:47.849 --> 00:18:50.000
what, what the data tells us, but there are

437
00:18:50.010 --> 00:18:53.310
also, there's room for change, there's room to, to

438
00:18:53.319 --> 00:18:55.599
um you know, reduce some of those impacts and

439
00:18:55.609 --> 00:18:58.010
basically it comes down to reducing emissions. It's not

440
00:18:58.020 --> 00:19:00.930
that complicated, but it's not about just you and

441
00:19:00.939 --> 00:19:03.349
I turning off the lights. It's about where the

442
00:19:03.359 --> 00:19:05.839
power for those lights comes from, which is where

443
00:19:05.849 --> 00:19:08.069
the messaging has got lost, I think, and that's

444
00:19:08.079 --> 00:19:09.329
not all of it, you know, some of it

445
00:19:09.339 --> 00:19:11.180
is that we're talking about electricity there and there's

446
00:19:11.189 --> 00:19:14.489
still um you know, cars on the road and,

447
00:19:14.500 --> 00:19:16.619
and uh uh uh you know, gas boilers and

448
00:19:16.630 --> 00:19:18.160
things, but, but actually a lot of shifts are

449
00:19:18.170 --> 00:19:20.000
happening, you know, in the, in the UK, a

450
00:19:20.010 --> 00:19:21.880
lot of people are buying electric vehicles and I

451
00:19:21.890 --> 00:19:24.400
think one in 10 vehicles now is an electric

452
00:19:24.410 --> 00:19:27.040
vehicle. Um AND people are switching over to heat

453
00:19:27.050 --> 00:19:28.640
pumps and things like that. So I think the

454
00:19:28.650 --> 00:19:32.510
electrification will also happen. But ironically, a lot of

455
00:19:32.520 --> 00:19:35.449
environmentals are against electrification because they think we should

456
00:19:35.459 --> 00:19:37.560
use less and not just have these kind of

457
00:19:37.729 --> 00:19:40.739
um changes where we maintain the same lifestyles. But

458
00:19:40.750 --> 00:19:42.839
I don't think, I don't think that that's the

459
00:19:42.849 --> 00:19:44.410
right approach. I don't think people will give up

460
00:19:44.420 --> 00:19:46.109
those lifestyles and I don't think they should have

461
00:19:46.119 --> 00:19:50.900
to either. You know, I think people will always

462
00:19:51.369 --> 00:19:53.390
favor convenience. So what we need to do is

463
00:19:53.400 --> 00:19:56.930
make it convenient and cheap to have clean power.

464
00:19:56.939 --> 00:19:59.310
Now, that's where nuclear comes in, right. If all

465
00:19:59.319 --> 00:20:01.310
of the world or at least the kind of

466
00:20:01.319 --> 00:20:04.109
developing world at the time had decarbonised the way

467
00:20:04.119 --> 00:20:09.430
France did 19 eighties build 50 plus reactors. Um

468
00:20:09.439 --> 00:20:11.469
OVER a period of about a decade completely de

469
00:20:11.479 --> 00:20:14.410
decarbonise their grid and they built some renewables too.

470
00:20:14.739 --> 00:20:17.579
Um If everywhere had done that, we wouldn't, we

471
00:20:17.589 --> 00:20:20.459
wouldn't have had that 1.5 warming report from scientists

472
00:20:20.469 --> 00:20:23.170
saying this is how bad it is. And, and

473
00:20:23.180 --> 00:20:24.989
the point I was making earlier about the consensus

474
00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:28.160
that report has a 99% consensus, that's a huge

475
00:20:28.170 --> 00:20:30.890
amount. So, yeah, you can find 1% of scientists

476
00:20:30.900 --> 00:20:32.680
who contribute to that report, who will say no.

477
00:20:32.689 --> 00:20:35.250
Actually, I disagree and I think it's just, you

478
00:20:35.260 --> 00:20:37.920
know, solar layers or whatever, um whatever arguments they

479
00:20:37.930 --> 00:20:39.760
have and that's fine. You know, that's, that's good

480
00:20:39.770 --> 00:20:42.010
actually, because if it was 100% you might think

481
00:20:42.020 --> 00:20:43.579
why is there no one disagreeing? Where is the

482
00:20:43.589 --> 00:20:45.439
descent? This is how science works, right? You hash

483
00:20:45.449 --> 00:20:49.300
it out. But 99% um, consensus is a really

484
00:20:49.310 --> 00:20:52.469
high number that, you know, it's like, uh 99

485
00:20:52.479 --> 00:20:54.469
you know, you have nine, you have 100 engineers

486
00:20:54.479 --> 00:20:57.229
and 99 of them say don't get in that

487
00:20:57.239 --> 00:21:00.329
car, maybe not engineers, mechanics don't get in that

488
00:21:00.339 --> 00:21:03.869
car because, you know, it's got really high likelihood

489
00:21:03.949 --> 00:21:05.900
that it will crash if you get in it.

490
00:21:05.910 --> 00:21:08.410
And then 1% says no, one person says no,

491
00:21:08.420 --> 00:21:11.349
it's, it's fine. Um, I would, you know, maybe

492
00:21:11.359 --> 00:21:13.250
that one person's right in a, in a, you

493
00:21:13.260 --> 00:21:15.160
know, in a really small, there's a really small

494
00:21:15.170 --> 00:21:16.959
chance that they are but you, most people would

495
00:21:16.969 --> 00:21:19.560
listen to the 99 and that's, I think that's,

496
00:21:19.569 --> 00:21:22.300
it's really important to talk about the consensus because

497
00:21:22.310 --> 00:21:24.719
of that. But also to remember that same report

498
00:21:24.729 --> 00:21:28.530
has the same consensus for what the mitigation strategies

499
00:21:28.540 --> 00:21:30.469
are. And that's where nuclear power comes in actually.

500
00:21:30.479 --> 00:21:34.020
And that's, you know, not been implemented as quickly

501
00:21:34.030 --> 00:21:35.589
as it could have been. Uh SOME, a lot

502
00:21:35.599 --> 00:21:37.280
of countries in the east are doing it. But

503
00:21:37.290 --> 00:21:40.130
in the west we have, I think fallen for

504
00:21:40.140 --> 00:21:42.400
environmental rhetoric for so long, we've made it difficult

505
00:21:42.410 --> 00:21:44.989
to build it here now, which is ridiculous because

506
00:21:45.180 --> 00:21:46.540
you want to solve the problem. That's one of

507
00:21:46.550 --> 00:21:48.069
the biggest solutions that we have.

508
00:21:48.910 --> 00:21:52.489
Mhm So just before we get into nuclear power,

509
00:21:52.500 --> 00:21:55.459
just for the audience to understand a little bit

510
00:21:55.469 --> 00:21:58.800
better. Uh Some of these terms, I mean, because

511
00:21:58.810 --> 00:22:02.959
sometimes people use the term clean energy and uh

512
00:22:02.969 --> 00:22:06.930
it's a bit unclear in particular contexts and the

513
00:22:06.939 --> 00:22:10.250
way that sometimes people communicate about it, what that

514
00:22:10.260 --> 00:22:14.329
really means. So what types of uh energy sources

515
00:22:14.339 --> 00:22:18.089
fall under the rubric of a clean energy?

516
00:22:18.770 --> 00:22:21.540
So, yeah, you're right. It's complicated. I tend to

517
00:22:21.550 --> 00:22:24.410
go by the our world in data analysis um

518
00:22:24.420 --> 00:22:26.109
which you know, anyone can go and look at

519
00:22:26.119 --> 00:22:27.619
on their website because it's very thorough the way

520
00:22:27.630 --> 00:22:30.239
they've thought about it. Um And they're looking at,

521
00:22:30.250 --> 00:22:32.140
they're looking at emissions, but they're also looking at

522
00:22:32.150 --> 00:22:34.890
things like land footprint. So you've got on the

523
00:22:34.900 --> 00:22:39.469
clean side, you've got solar wind, hydro and nuclear.

524
00:22:39.839 --> 00:22:42.989
Um THEN under fossil fuels, you've got gas, coal.

525
00:22:43.280 --> 00:22:48.810
Um And actually I would say that gas ga,

526
00:22:49.160 --> 00:22:51.319
I think actually, again, there's a problem with lumping

527
00:22:51.329 --> 00:22:53.910
them together as fossil fuels because gas is probably,

528
00:22:53.920 --> 00:22:56.390
you know, gas compared to coal. If you choose,

529
00:22:56.400 --> 00:22:57.989
if you have to choose one, choose gas, it

530
00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:00.790
is much cleaner. It's not in the clean energy

531
00:23:00.800 --> 00:23:03.310
side, but for some countries where the choice is

532
00:23:03.319 --> 00:23:05.910
just gas or coal, they should absolutely have gas.

533
00:23:05.920 --> 00:23:08.560
I think again, this kind of western rhetoric influencing

534
00:23:08.569 --> 00:23:11.119
other nations saying, oh, you shouldn't be burning. Um

535
00:23:11.130 --> 00:23:13.540
ANY of these fuels is, is ridiculous. They are

536
00:23:13.550 --> 00:23:15.949
not able to, to, to leap ahead and have

537
00:23:15.959 --> 00:23:18.250
clean energy. But I I do think there's a

538
00:23:18.260 --> 00:23:22.430
lot of confusion with people use clean synonymously with

539
00:23:22.439 --> 00:23:25.689
renewables. And I think that's a problem because renewables,

540
00:23:25.699 --> 00:23:30.750
technically it's wind, solar, hydro and biomass biomass is

541
00:23:30.760 --> 00:23:33.310
not clean and should not be included in that.

542
00:23:33.319 --> 00:23:37.380
But actually if you look at um countries different

543
00:23:37.390 --> 00:23:40.079
kind of environmental top targets around the world, they

544
00:23:40.089 --> 00:23:41.739
c biomass. So a lot of the time they'll

545
00:23:41.750 --> 00:23:44.560
say, hey, we have 60% renewable energy. When you

546
00:23:44.569 --> 00:23:46.819
look at the figures, 50% of it is, is

547
00:23:46.829 --> 00:23:49.280
biomass. That's really problematic. I mean, we, we have

548
00:23:49.290 --> 00:23:51.640
it here as well. Um AND we count it

549
00:23:51.650 --> 00:23:53.880
as a climate solution and it, and it gets

550
00:23:53.890 --> 00:23:57.069
funded and subsidies when actually, you know, it's uh

551
00:23:57.079 --> 00:24:00.375
it's polluting very polluting. So it's not, it's not

552
00:24:00.385 --> 00:24:02.305
clean, but it's classed as renewable. So we shouldn't

553
00:24:02.314 --> 00:24:06.234
use renewables synonymously or renewables are all created, you

554
00:24:06.244 --> 00:24:09.155
know, like fossil fuels, they're d they're different. So,

555
00:24:09.444 --> 00:24:12.244
um, hydropower is extremely reliable. So I like to

556
00:24:12.255 --> 00:24:14.305
talk about reliable, clean energy. In which case, you

557
00:24:14.314 --> 00:24:16.984
just narrow it down to nuclear and hydro, hydro

558
00:24:16.994 --> 00:24:20.385
is great. Right. But it's geographically dependent that everyone

559
00:24:20.395 --> 00:24:22.829
can have a lot of hydropower. It also has

560
00:24:22.839 --> 00:24:24.770
more risks than nuclear power, which a lot of

561
00:24:24.780 --> 00:24:26.550
people don't believe. And I'd urge them to go

562
00:24:26.560 --> 00:24:28.920
and look up the Bir Dam disaster or any

563
00:24:28.930 --> 00:24:31.890
dam disaster really. And they'll say, oh, well, it

564
00:24:31.900 --> 00:24:34.030
doesn't, you know, displace people the way nuclear. Yes,

565
00:24:34.040 --> 00:24:38.219
it does. It completely flattens everything in its area,

566
00:24:38.229 --> 00:24:41.130
you know, um and has harmed a lot of

567
00:24:41.140 --> 00:24:42.790
people but that I'm not saying that we shouldn't

568
00:24:42.800 --> 00:24:45.670
build it. Um I just think it's interesting that

569
00:24:45.680 --> 00:24:48.089
people don't protest it, they don't tend to protest

570
00:24:48.099 --> 00:24:50.359
it the way they protested nuclear for a long

571
00:24:50.369 --> 00:24:53.819
time. Um Yeah. So the, the definitions I use

572
00:24:53.829 --> 00:24:56.939
are the, our world in data uh figures because

573
00:24:56.949 --> 00:25:00.180
they've really crunched the numbers and, and, and come

574
00:25:00.189 --> 00:25:01.739
out with that. But also it's again, it's in

575
00:25:01.750 --> 00:25:04.750
the IPCC report, they say you need, they say

576
00:25:04.760 --> 00:25:08.030
to decarbonize, uh we need a combination of nuclear

577
00:25:08.040 --> 00:25:09.689
renewables and there's no other way to do it.

578
00:25:09.880 --> 00:25:12.939
And that is actually, um if you look at

579
00:25:13.319 --> 00:25:15.660
all the industrialized nations in the world that have

580
00:25:15.670 --> 00:25:18.219
been able to decarbonise which to reach over 70

581
00:25:18.229 --> 00:25:20.819
or 80% clean energy mix in their grid. Uh

582
00:25:20.829 --> 00:25:22.430
They haven't been able to do it without a

583
00:25:22.439 --> 00:25:24.800
combination of nuclear and renewables. Even the countries that

584
00:25:24.810 --> 00:25:27.189
have a lot of hydropower, uh, like Sweden still

585
00:25:27.199 --> 00:25:29.839
use some nuclear, although they don't need as much

586
00:25:29.849 --> 00:25:30.780
as other countries.

587
00:25:32.030 --> 00:25:35.709
So when it comes to nuclear energy specifically, what

588
00:25:35.719 --> 00:25:37.550
would you say are perhaps some of the most

589
00:25:37.560 --> 00:25:42.089
common myths and misconceptions because sometimes the way people

590
00:25:42.099 --> 00:25:45.459
talk about nuclear energy, it seems like a boogeyman

591
00:25:45.469 --> 00:25:46.910
or something like that.

592
00:25:47.300 --> 00:25:49.060
I think it's changing a lot. But, um, there

593
00:25:49.069 --> 00:25:52.989
are a lot of ingrained old ideas. Um, WHICH

594
00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:56.319
is, yeah, you know, that it's, it's not safe,

595
00:25:56.329 --> 00:25:59.270
which isn't true that the waste is like, really

596
00:25:59.280 --> 00:26:01.810
dangerous, which isn't true. I mean, technically, yes, the

597
00:26:01.819 --> 00:26:04.599
waste is dangerous but so is medical waste. Um,

598
00:26:04.609 --> 00:26:06.430
YOU know, it's well managed is the main thing

599
00:26:06.439 --> 00:26:10.680
and it's never killed anyone. Um, WHEREAS, you know,

600
00:26:10.689 --> 00:26:13.260
fossil fuel waste is being extraordinary in this atmosphere.

601
00:26:13.540 --> 00:26:16.430
So, yeah, those are probably the main ones. But

602
00:26:16.439 --> 00:26:18.660
now I think actually the conversation shifted when I

603
00:26:18.670 --> 00:26:20.760
started out in this work years ago, those were

604
00:26:20.770 --> 00:26:23.479
the main arguments. Now, people seem to have moved

605
00:26:23.489 --> 00:26:24.770
forward that, you know, I think a lot of

606
00:26:24.780 --> 00:26:27.000
the information's out there and people have gone, ok,

607
00:26:27.010 --> 00:26:29.050
maybe we were wrong on those things. So they

608
00:26:29.060 --> 00:26:31.319
have different arguments now, which is, takes a long

609
00:26:31.329 --> 00:26:34.839
time to build and it's expensive. Um, NOW it

610
00:26:34.849 --> 00:26:37.930
can take a long time to build. Absolutely. Um,

611
00:26:38.089 --> 00:26:40.800
BUT the reason for that is because of regulations

612
00:26:40.810 --> 00:26:43.390
and other problems, not because of the technology. So,

613
00:26:43.400 --> 00:26:45.130
if you look in South Korea, other parts of

614
00:26:45.140 --> 00:26:48.640
the East, um United Arab Emirates, they're building them

615
00:26:48.650 --> 00:26:50.989
in, you know, four or five years, new reactors

616
00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:54.729
can be built really quickly. Um, WHEREAS I actually

617
00:26:54.739 --> 00:26:56.670
saw a study recently that said if we try

618
00:26:56.680 --> 00:26:59.599
to build uh an Apr 1000, which is South

619
00:26:59.609 --> 00:27:01.545
Korean reactor, we tried to build it here in

620
00:27:01.555 --> 00:27:04.444
the UK. It wouldn't even pass, pass the basic

621
00:27:04.454 --> 00:27:08.385
planning regulations for about seven years because it is

622
00:27:08.395 --> 00:27:12.005
so strict. But the regulations are more strict than

623
00:27:12.015 --> 00:27:15.125
for building a coal firepower station. That's how ridiculous

624
00:27:15.135 --> 00:27:16.545
it is. So these myths have had a real

625
00:27:16.555 --> 00:27:19.415
impact on real life and so it's kind of

626
00:27:19.425 --> 00:27:21.994
a perpetuating cycle because people say it takes too

627
00:27:22.005 --> 00:27:24.699
long to build and then they, they protest it

628
00:27:24.800 --> 00:27:26.489
and it takes even longer to build because, and

629
00:27:26.500 --> 00:27:29.219
that's happening here at size. Well, c uh because

630
00:27:29.229 --> 00:27:32.410
they um the environmental groups are taking size world

631
00:27:32.420 --> 00:27:35.619
to court saying your environmental standards aren't good enough.

632
00:27:35.630 --> 00:27:37.819
It's actually the corpus said that's not true. And

633
00:27:38.030 --> 00:27:39.310
you know, but now it's gone through an appeal

634
00:27:39.319 --> 00:27:41.250
process but it slows everything down, but mostly it

635
00:27:41.260 --> 00:27:43.739
costs a lot of money. So it becomes more

636
00:27:43.750 --> 00:27:46.810
expensive. It doesn't have to be expensive. So those

637
00:27:46.819 --> 00:27:48.920
are, they are. And they are myths, I would

638
00:27:48.930 --> 00:27:50.869
say, you know, they, if you just look at

639
00:27:50.880 --> 00:27:52.579
it on a sur surface level. Yeah. In the

640
00:27:52.589 --> 00:27:54.650
west, some of, some of the countries in the

641
00:27:54.660 --> 00:27:57.459
west in the UK is, it is expensive to

642
00:27:57.469 --> 00:27:58.800
build them and they do take a long time,

643
00:27:58.810 --> 00:28:00.609
but that's not inherent to the technology. So we

644
00:28:00.619 --> 00:28:03.500
need to really have some reform in the planning

645
00:28:03.510 --> 00:28:07.420
process there. Um, AND like reregulate nuclear, as I

646
00:28:07.430 --> 00:28:10.630
like to say, um other myths, I mean, I've

647
00:28:10.640 --> 00:28:12.329
heard some ridiculous myths over the years. I think

648
00:28:12.339 --> 00:28:14.020
a lot of them have died a slow death,

649
00:28:14.030 --> 00:28:16.130
which is great. Uh The funniest one I ever

650
00:28:16.140 --> 00:28:19.630
heard was that nuclear energy is sexist because it's

651
00:28:19.640 --> 00:28:21.670
like a hard energy and men like it. I

652
00:28:21.680 --> 00:28:24.060
know how ridiculous but that, you know, some people

653
00:28:24.069 --> 00:28:26.160
really believe that and they'll say wind and solar

654
00:28:26.170 --> 00:28:29.530
are natural because it's the elements uh which I

655
00:28:29.540 --> 00:28:31.380
think is funny because what's more natural than the

656
00:28:31.390 --> 00:28:33.589
atom actually if you want to use that logic.

657
00:28:33.599 --> 00:28:35.489
But anyway, it's not a logical argument. So we

658
00:28:35.500 --> 00:28:36.959
don't need to talk about it, but that's the

659
00:28:36.969 --> 00:28:38.170
funniest one I've ever heard.

660
00:28:39.079 --> 00:28:41.199
Do you think that when it comes to nuclear

661
00:28:41.209 --> 00:28:44.900
energy, we should consider a a and of course,

662
00:28:44.910 --> 00:28:47.390
I am not sure if we would think about

663
00:28:47.400 --> 00:28:50.209
this as a limitation and this is not a

664
00:28:50.280 --> 00:28:54.219
criticism of nuclear energy itself or nuclear power. But

665
00:28:54.229 --> 00:28:56.339
do you think that we should consider perhaps the

666
00:28:56.349 --> 00:28:59.420
availability of uranium or not.

667
00:29:00.010 --> 00:29:02.510
Um, YEAH, we should think about uranium, you know,

668
00:29:02.520 --> 00:29:04.979
where we get the reserves from. Um, A lot

669
00:29:04.989 --> 00:29:06.969
of them come from Kazakhstan. Canada has a lot

670
00:29:06.979 --> 00:29:10.900
of Australia has a lot. Um, THERE'S no immediate

671
00:29:10.910 --> 00:29:13.119
shortage. I just think it's a bit weird that

672
00:29:14.199 --> 00:29:16.939
the people who say it's going to run out,

673
00:29:17.040 --> 00:29:18.560
you know, it's going to run out in, in

674
00:29:18.569 --> 00:29:21.469
whatever, 4000 years are the same people who are

675
00:29:21.479 --> 00:29:23.339
saying there won't be a planet 4000 years. I

676
00:29:23.349 --> 00:29:25.479
always think that's a strange thing. You know, there

677
00:29:25.489 --> 00:29:28.119
won't be a habitable planet because they think like

678
00:29:28.130 --> 00:29:31.260
will be extinct. Life will be extinct. Um, BUT

679
00:29:31.270 --> 00:29:33.569
I've seen, I mean, I've seen people crunch the

680
00:29:33.579 --> 00:29:36.239
numbers on this. Um What is view is one

681
00:29:36.250 --> 00:29:38.839
of my go tos but Nick Turan who's crunched

682
00:29:38.849 --> 00:29:41.160
on the numbers and he said if we use

683
00:29:41.170 --> 00:29:45.199
breeder reactors, we've got 6 billion years worth of

684
00:29:45.209 --> 00:29:48.599
uranium. So it really, again, it depends on, it's

685
00:29:48.609 --> 00:29:51.260
not just about reserves, it's about how they're used,

686
00:29:51.270 --> 00:29:52.900
but I still think it's just, you know, it's

687
00:29:52.910 --> 00:29:54.910
a silly argument. It's like the whole peak oil.

688
00:29:54.920 --> 00:29:56.800
Do you remember that the peak oil we're hitting

689
00:29:56.810 --> 00:29:58.739
peak oil? Did, did that happen or did we

690
00:29:58.750 --> 00:30:01.339
find new reserves? In fact, we increasingly find better

691
00:30:01.349 --> 00:30:03.979
technologies for finding new reserves or for, for, for

692
00:30:03.989 --> 00:30:08.459
using, um, for using our resources better? Actually, we're

693
00:30:08.469 --> 00:30:10.199
really good at doing that. And with nuclear, you

694
00:30:10.209 --> 00:30:13.489
can recycle, right? Which very few countries do, which

695
00:30:13.500 --> 00:30:16.040
is unfortunate. But that's another thing that a little

696
00:30:16.050 --> 00:30:18.099
bit of uranium goes a long, long ways is

697
00:30:18.109 --> 00:30:20.119
what um I often tell people, you know, en

698
00:30:20.130 --> 00:30:24.250
energy density is really important. Um So, no, we're

699
00:30:24.260 --> 00:30:25.449
not going to run out of it any time

700
00:30:25.459 --> 00:30:27.969
soon. But I would say that even if, even

701
00:30:27.979 --> 00:30:30.760
if you did say I've calculated the numbers and

702
00:30:30.770 --> 00:30:34.979
I'm sure that without interventions, without finding more, we've

703
00:30:34.989 --> 00:30:38.040
got 1000 years, I really hope that we have

704
00:30:38.050 --> 00:30:42.349
better energy, you know, electricity generation sources in 1000

705
00:30:42.359 --> 00:30:44.579
years. I would hope that we have fusion and

706
00:30:44.589 --> 00:30:47.390
I know that's a big hope, but I can't

707
00:30:47.400 --> 00:30:49.819
imagine that our progress would stall that much. I

708
00:30:49.829 --> 00:30:51.209
mean, I think there'd have to be a really

709
00:30:51.219 --> 00:30:54.119
big significant event to stop. You know, if you

710
00:30:54.130 --> 00:30:56.699
look at what we have now compared to 40

711
00:30:56.709 --> 00:30:59.439
years ago, mobile phones A I internet and then

712
00:30:59.449 --> 00:31:02.880
40 years before that, it's really rapid change. We're

713
00:31:02.890 --> 00:31:04.770
in a real kind of technological era. I would

714
00:31:04.780 --> 00:31:08.459
expect there should be something, something better out there.

715
00:31:08.469 --> 00:31:10.280
And I, and I think nuclear is great, you

716
00:31:10.290 --> 00:31:14.469
know, don't get me wrong. But um yeah, I,

717
00:31:14.479 --> 00:31:16.189
I think it's a silly argument

718
00:31:17.510 --> 00:31:23.500
and about uh renewable energy because sometimes people, particularly

719
00:31:23.510 --> 00:31:27.170
activists talk about the different kinds of renewable energy

720
00:31:27.180 --> 00:31:30.170
as, as a sort of a panacea, right? And,

721
00:31:30.540 --> 00:31:33.969
but what are the limitations here in terms of

722
00:31:33.979 --> 00:31:36.989
the extent to which we can or could rely

723
00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:41.209
on renewable sources of energy to tackle climate change.

724
00:31:41.219 --> 00:31:43.380
So, I mean, people have different opinions on this.

725
00:31:43.390 --> 00:31:45.089
We're in the realm of opinion now, this is

726
00:31:45.099 --> 00:31:48.819
not representing uh solid data because there isn't any,

727
00:31:48.829 --> 00:31:51.930
it's very, you know, it's, it's completely variable because

728
00:31:51.939 --> 00:31:53.760
for example, in Britain, this is not a good

729
00:31:53.770 --> 00:31:54.979
place to have a lot of solar farms. It

730
00:31:54.989 --> 00:31:57.199
is not a very sunny country. I mean, it's

731
00:31:57.209 --> 00:31:58.780
spring now and we're lucky if we get any

732
00:31:58.790 --> 00:32:03.819
sunshine. Um, AND that's, that's, that's consistent. Um But

733
00:32:03.829 --> 00:32:06.979
then at the same time, even in, um, you

734
00:32:06.989 --> 00:32:09.329
know, some of the sunniest countries and in places

735
00:32:09.339 --> 00:32:12.099
like borne where they've built a lot of, um,

736
00:32:12.109 --> 00:32:16.510
solar power. It's still not, it's not, but it's

737
00:32:16.520 --> 00:32:18.660
not helping much with the grid and in the

738
00:32:18.670 --> 00:32:21.060
summer it might, you know. So, all right, here's

739
00:32:21.069 --> 00:32:23.199
an example. We, it's really windy here at the

740
00:32:23.209 --> 00:32:26.969
moment, ridiculously, windy gale force winds, things blowing across

741
00:32:26.979 --> 00:32:31.290
the garden. Um And because of that, we suddenly

742
00:32:31.300 --> 00:32:33.699
got a huge surge in wind power. All the

743
00:32:33.709 --> 00:32:36.829
articles in the reporting are saying, look at this,

744
00:32:36.839 --> 00:32:38.920
Britain's got all this wind power, we're gonna be

745
00:32:38.930 --> 00:32:40.859
wind, we're gonna be powered by wind in the

746
00:32:40.869 --> 00:32:43.540
future. All these journalists are missing the point that

747
00:32:43.550 --> 00:32:46.219
it's not normally this windy, you can't store it

748
00:32:46.229 --> 00:32:48.030
for when it's not windy. And I know that

749
00:32:48.040 --> 00:32:50.280
sounds really ridiculously simple. But that is the, that

750
00:32:50.290 --> 00:32:52.189
is the stage of communication we're at with a

751
00:32:52.199 --> 00:32:55.130
lot of these people. So, yeah, it's fine to

752
00:32:55.140 --> 00:32:57.130
have it because at the moment it's powering the

753
00:32:57.140 --> 00:32:58.989
grid and we're hardly use, we're using like 4%

754
00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:00.430
gas, which is really unusual for us. So it

755
00:33:00.439 --> 00:33:04.180
is good. But because the storage capability isn't there,

756
00:33:04.479 --> 00:33:07.520
it doesn't matter tomorrow or next week or for

757
00:33:07.530 --> 00:33:09.079
the rest of the year when it isn't very

758
00:33:09.089 --> 00:33:12.369
windy or isn't very sunny. And so what I'm

759
00:33:12.380 --> 00:33:15.380
trying to say is it's quite limited. It's not,

760
00:33:15.569 --> 00:33:17.969
it's not an abundant energy source, it's limited. Now,

761
00:33:17.979 --> 00:33:19.719
a lot of environmentalists know this and they will

762
00:33:19.729 --> 00:33:23.020
say, why can't we live with intermittent, you know,

763
00:33:23.300 --> 00:33:26.219
occasional energy. And I've know, I know environmentalists who've

764
00:33:26.229 --> 00:33:28.500
said I have panels on my roof and when

765
00:33:28.510 --> 00:33:30.770
I use what they supply and when they're not

766
00:33:30.780 --> 00:33:34.030
supplying, I don't, I don't use anything and that's

767
00:33:34.040 --> 00:33:37.180
fine if they, you know, don't mind that they

768
00:33:37.189 --> 00:33:39.510
miss their favorite TV program or whatever. But we

769
00:33:39.520 --> 00:33:41.609
need to be a bit more realistic that we

770
00:33:41.619 --> 00:33:44.349
need to keep, you know, fridges running, right. We

771
00:33:44.359 --> 00:33:46.689
need to keep the lights working if you need

772
00:33:46.699 --> 00:33:48.020
to need to, we don't want to go back

773
00:33:48.030 --> 00:33:50.849
to using candles at night because your, your panels

774
00:33:50.859 --> 00:33:53.599
um because you've run out of stored solar energy.

775
00:33:53.619 --> 00:33:55.469
So the, the issue really is that the storage

776
00:33:55.479 --> 00:33:58.560
isn't very good. Now, 15 years ago, I was

777
00:33:58.569 --> 00:34:01.109
a big advocate for, for wind and solar. And

778
00:34:01.119 --> 00:34:03.089
I would say if we put more money into

779
00:34:03.099 --> 00:34:05.449
it, if countries actually invested in it around the

780
00:34:05.459 --> 00:34:07.650
corner, we've got, we're gonna have amazing battery storage.

781
00:34:07.660 --> 00:34:09.010
And I think it's really sad that people are

782
00:34:09.020 --> 00:34:11.260
making those same arguments today because the fact is

783
00:34:11.270 --> 00:34:13.668
that in 15 years that hasn't happened, the storage

784
00:34:13.679 --> 00:34:16.100
has improved somewhat, but you're not going to change

785
00:34:16.110 --> 00:34:18.870
the basic fundamental laws of physics, right? That is,

786
00:34:18.879 --> 00:34:20.310
that is as good as the storage is gonna

787
00:34:20.320 --> 00:34:22.270
get. And actually we now have a case study

788
00:34:22.280 --> 00:34:24.850
study which is Germany. So Germany is a really

789
00:34:24.860 --> 00:34:26.770
good case study in answer to your question, which

790
00:34:26.780 --> 00:34:28.760
is how much can a can a country rely

791
00:34:28.770 --> 00:34:31.928
on this? All right, industrialized nation, you know, very

792
00:34:31.938 --> 00:34:35.217
successful nation, uh high quality of life. They've done

793
00:34:35.228 --> 00:34:37.967
really good stuff at, at reducing emissions by insulating

794
00:34:37.978 --> 00:34:40.438
houses and EVs and like, you know, all the

795
00:34:40.447 --> 00:34:41.697
kind of measures that you can do on the

796
00:34:41.708 --> 00:34:43.467
ground. They've done that and, and also people are

797
00:34:43.478 --> 00:34:46.029
very good at, you know, that taking shorter showers.

798
00:34:46.039 --> 00:34:47.967
So they, they've helped with the individual change, the

799
00:34:47.978 --> 00:34:52.820
behavioral change even then they built loads of, of

800
00:34:52.830 --> 00:34:55.770
wind turbines and solar pans. They built huge amounts,

801
00:34:55.780 --> 00:34:58.709
you know, they invested trillions in this not small

802
00:34:58.719 --> 00:35:02.479
amounts of money, trillions of euros phased out their

803
00:35:02.489 --> 00:35:04.610
coal fired power stations, phased out the nuclear power

804
00:35:04.620 --> 00:35:07.879
stations. What happened? I mean, everybody knows what happened

805
00:35:07.889 --> 00:35:11.219
by now, which is that your grid will fail

806
00:35:11.229 --> 00:35:13.100
like you and they did actually have to tell

807
00:35:13.110 --> 00:35:15.290
people in certain regions that they had to ration

808
00:35:15.570 --> 00:35:17.189
how much, you know, how long they could be

809
00:35:17.199 --> 00:35:19.969
in the shower for things like that. Uh Which

810
00:35:20.419 --> 00:35:23.800
I think actually just turns people against um clean

811
00:35:23.810 --> 00:35:26.540
energy or climate action because they don't like, they

812
00:35:26.550 --> 00:35:28.159
don't like that and it, and it upsets their

813
00:35:28.169 --> 00:35:30.850
lives, but mainly it's a case study to show

814
00:35:31.100 --> 00:35:32.659
you can't do it with the entire grid. You

815
00:35:32.669 --> 00:35:34.750
just can't, nowhere's been able to, and they really

816
00:35:34.760 --> 00:35:36.169
did try, they did put the money into it.

817
00:35:36.179 --> 00:35:37.840
They did have the best storage. They did set

818
00:35:37.850 --> 00:35:39.419
up all the poles and wires, they put all

819
00:35:39.429 --> 00:35:41.929
that money into it and it's not cheaper than,

820
00:35:41.939 --> 00:35:43.570
than if they put that money into nuclear. It's

821
00:35:43.580 --> 00:35:45.889
just not if they had put that money into

822
00:35:45.899 --> 00:35:52.379
nuclear, they'd have clean, reliable energy. Um, AND people

823
00:35:52.389 --> 00:35:57.320
wouldn't have to ration. Um, AND they would, the

824
00:35:57.330 --> 00:35:59.820
grid would be clean, but now instead they've had

825
00:35:59.830 --> 00:36:03.580
to reopen their, their, um, mothballed coal fired power

826
00:36:03.590 --> 00:36:05.459
stations. And as we've all seen, you know, now

827
00:36:05.469 --> 00:36:07.580
they're mining for, for, for lignite, which is the

828
00:36:07.590 --> 00:36:10.570
dirtiest fuel, right? It's the dirtiest coal, uh, which

829
00:36:10.580 --> 00:36:14.010
is terrible. It's ter, it's terrible for, um, you

830
00:36:14.020 --> 00:36:16.199
know, the fact that they had, they had clean

831
00:36:16.209 --> 00:36:19.020
power stations, legal power stations and out of fear

832
00:36:19.030 --> 00:36:22.500
of a tsunami, you know, because of what happened

833
00:36:22.510 --> 00:36:26.500
Fukushima. Um THEY, they shut them all down. But,

834
00:36:26.510 --> 00:36:28.919
but that, you know, I think in a way

835
00:36:28.929 --> 00:36:31.239
that had to happen because it is a case

836
00:36:31.250 --> 00:36:33.040
study for the world now where the people like

837
00:36:33.050 --> 00:36:35.020
me who used to say, well, nowhere's tried doing

838
00:36:35.030 --> 00:36:37.120
it can now say whoa, whoa, whoa, we tried.

839
00:36:37.429 --> 00:36:40.370
You can have 15 or 20% of wind and

840
00:36:40.379 --> 00:36:42.560
solar on your grid. You can, if it's hydro,

841
00:36:42.570 --> 00:36:44.149
obviously, you could have a lot more. But for

842
00:36:44.199 --> 00:36:46.719
wind and solar, that's the limit, the rest needs

843
00:36:46.729 --> 00:36:47.909
to come from somewhere else. And you need to

844
00:36:47.919 --> 00:36:49.800
be honest about that's either going to be fossil.

845
00:36:49.830 --> 00:36:51.310
Well, it's always going to be nuclear and you

846
00:36:51.320 --> 00:36:56.439
can't, you can't say it's neither. Um So that's

847
00:36:56.449 --> 00:36:57.800
where the technology is at. And I, and I

848
00:36:57.810 --> 00:37:01.909
honestly don't believe that it, that it can, that

849
00:37:01.919 --> 00:37:04.729
problem will be solved by better technology. I think

850
00:37:04.739 --> 00:37:06.530
that technology is the best that we're going to

851
00:37:06.760 --> 00:37:08.679
to get. And there are also drawbacks obviously in

852
00:37:08.689 --> 00:37:12.060
how much land they require. Um YOU know, nuclear

853
00:37:12.570 --> 00:37:14.979
requires a very small amount of land for, for

854
00:37:14.989 --> 00:37:17.790
the amount of energy it produces. But, you know,

855
00:37:19.719 --> 00:37:22.100
it's complicated. You know, if, if you're reusing land,

856
00:37:22.110 --> 00:37:24.679
that's just, it's not used for anything fine but

857
00:37:24.689 --> 00:37:28.030
don't bulldoze trees to build, you know, to build

858
00:37:28.040 --> 00:37:31.300
solar farms. Some places are doing that. Uh I

859
00:37:31.310 --> 00:37:33.820
think, I think when the hyper focus becomes on

860
00:37:33.830 --> 00:37:35.580
just emissions that's also a problem. We need to

861
00:37:35.590 --> 00:37:38.590
think about biodiversity as well and longevity of the

862
00:37:38.600 --> 00:37:40.820
resources. So you think, you know, a power plant

863
00:37:40.830 --> 00:37:44.020
is going to last at least 60 years. Whereas

864
00:37:44.530 --> 00:37:46.969
the turbines, solar panels we need replacing in about

865
00:37:46.979 --> 00:37:49.570
25 nobody thinks about this or about the cost

866
00:37:49.580 --> 00:37:51.639
in turn, by having to replace them. So there's

867
00:37:51.649 --> 00:37:54.780
a lot of different factors. But environmentally nuclear is

868
00:37:54.790 --> 00:37:57.689
the cleanest healthiest solution for the planet. And that's

869
00:37:57.699 --> 00:38:00.250
why I advocate for it. It's purely my reasoning.

870
00:38:00.709 --> 00:38:06.030
Mhm. So you're also interested in ethical parenting? What

871
00:38:06.040 --> 00:38:09.469
is that about? And how does it tie to

872
00:38:09.479 --> 00:38:11.010
uh, environmentalism?

873
00:38:11.229 --> 00:38:14.370
So, um, so initially when I started out with

874
00:38:14.379 --> 00:38:15.590
that, you know, and I wrote that book, it

875
00:38:15.600 --> 00:38:19.370
was because, um, I'd become a parent and the

876
00:38:19.379 --> 00:38:22.169
books that were on the market for green parents,

877
00:38:22.179 --> 00:38:24.570
for people who cared about environmental issues were full

878
00:38:24.580 --> 00:38:28.270
of nonsense, like, full of pseudoscience, honestly, like, don't

879
00:38:28.280 --> 00:38:32.889
vaccinate your kids, um, at all. Um, YOU know,

880
00:38:32.899 --> 00:38:37.679
um, don't, um, don't, don't drive, I mean, I

881
00:38:37.689 --> 00:38:40.629
don't, I don't drive but there were a lot

882
00:38:40.639 --> 00:38:42.290
of, there were a lot of things that they,

883
00:38:42.300 --> 00:38:47.489
these books, um, argued for that were just impractical

884
00:38:47.500 --> 00:38:50.280
for most parents, like, and actually, it's being a

885
00:38:50.290 --> 00:38:55.310
non driver has had some significant challenges, but mostly

886
00:38:55.320 --> 00:38:57.590
they were just, you know, also I would say

887
00:38:57.939 --> 00:39:00.560
it's not always true, it's not always true. But,

888
00:39:00.570 --> 00:39:05.889
you know, if, if you think about most people's

889
00:39:05.899 --> 00:39:08.439
daily lifestyles. We rely on a lot of different

890
00:39:08.449 --> 00:39:10.679
things. Right. Like we rely on being able to

891
00:39:10.689 --> 00:39:12.070
get from A to B, we have to do

892
00:39:12.080 --> 00:39:15.020
school runs, we have to choose how we feed

893
00:39:15.030 --> 00:39:17.050
our kids. And a lot of these books were

894
00:39:17.060 --> 00:39:20.729
just throwing rubbish out there saying, you know, here's

895
00:39:20.739 --> 00:39:22.530
the diet that you need to give your child

896
00:39:22.540 --> 00:39:24.260
or you should have. Here's the way you should

897
00:39:24.270 --> 00:39:26.570
even just how you should give birth. A home

898
00:39:26.580 --> 00:39:28.370
birth is natural. Don't give, I mean, I know

899
00:39:28.379 --> 00:39:29.879
it, it probably sounds extreme to you, but this

900
00:39:29.889 --> 00:39:31.709
was what I was coming across again and again.

901
00:39:32.090 --> 00:39:33.659
And so I kind of put those books aside

902
00:39:33.669 --> 00:39:36.290
and said, every single book that I looked at

903
00:39:36.300 --> 00:39:38.969
at that time was saying these and I thought

904
00:39:38.979 --> 00:39:41.719
it was dangerous. And actually, by the way, I

905
00:39:41.729 --> 00:39:43.800
would love to know who's crunched the data to

906
00:39:43.810 --> 00:39:47.810
say that homebirth is more environmentally friendly than, you

907
00:39:47.820 --> 00:39:49.620
know, than, than a hospital.

908
00:39:49.629 --> 00:39:51.969
But I mean, I also don't understand the old

909
00:39:52.020 --> 00:39:52.750
bit about

910
00:39:53.790 --> 00:39:56.360
why, why do they come? Right. So that's why

911
00:39:56.370 --> 00:39:58.419
I kind of, I broaden it. I'd say it's

912
00:39:58.429 --> 00:40:01.600
ethical her. But I, but then they're saying it's

913
00:40:01.610 --> 00:40:04.659
unethical to, to give your baby an injection. And

914
00:40:04.669 --> 00:40:06.060
then I would ask, well, are you saying that

915
00:40:06.070 --> 00:40:08.520
they should have no medicine? Well, and actually, actually,

916
00:40:08.530 --> 00:40:10.590
some of these books actually did say that they

917
00:40:10.600 --> 00:40:14.080
said hoop the natural remedies. I mean, it's dangerous.

918
00:40:14.090 --> 00:40:16.590
Honestly, some of it is really dangerous and you'd

919
00:40:16.600 --> 00:40:18.659
be surprised at how many people follow this advice

920
00:40:18.669 --> 00:40:21.520
because the books scare them. You know, I read

921
00:40:21.530 --> 00:40:23.080
the books with a huge prince of salt. Like

922
00:40:23.090 --> 00:40:24.780
this is a true, you know, they're saying that

923
00:40:24.790 --> 00:40:26.620
my baby would die if they have too much

924
00:40:26.629 --> 00:40:29.129
paracetamol. That's not true. You know, I mean, you

925
00:40:29.139 --> 00:40:31.090
know, give babies paracetamol but, you know, when they're

926
00:40:31.100 --> 00:40:34.270
older cow or whatever, the branded version for kids.

927
00:40:34.330 --> 00:40:37.379
So what I did, so I went, what I

928
00:40:37.389 --> 00:40:39.939
did was decide someone needs to put out a

929
00:40:39.949 --> 00:40:44.179
sensible book that actually meets the concerns these people

930
00:40:44.189 --> 00:40:46.149
have of green or ethical parity and maybe just

931
00:40:46.159 --> 00:40:48.479
define it a little bit. So I did actually

932
00:40:48.489 --> 00:40:51.939
look into things like the emissions caused by having

933
00:40:51.949 --> 00:40:54.239
a homebirth versus, you know, a hospital. But it

934
00:40:54.250 --> 00:40:56.229
is, I mean, it's negligible, right? Because there's just

935
00:40:56.239 --> 00:41:00.209
too many different factors involved. But all right, people

936
00:41:00.219 --> 00:41:01.689
would say one's natural on the other. But then

937
00:41:01.699 --> 00:41:03.629
I would say, well, then you're saying it's natural

938
00:41:03.639 --> 00:41:05.310
for a lot of babies to die in, in,

939
00:41:05.320 --> 00:41:07.489
in childbirth and it's fine, it is fine to

940
00:41:07.500 --> 00:41:09.310
have a hummus to put that out there. But

941
00:41:09.469 --> 00:41:12.510
what annoyed me was the amount of misinformation about

942
00:41:12.520 --> 00:41:15.149
it but also kind of the pressure, you know,

943
00:41:15.159 --> 00:41:18.919
from these groups and books, the pressure to do

944
00:41:18.929 --> 00:41:22.409
X because it supposedly is more ethical and moral

945
00:41:22.439 --> 00:41:24.949
um and more environmentally friendly somehow. So I went

946
00:41:24.959 --> 00:41:26.510
away and I crunched the numbers and then some

947
00:41:26.520 --> 00:41:28.010
things, there was a lot of data, for example,

948
00:41:28.020 --> 00:41:31.199
nappies, you know, there's data on, on cloth nappies

949
00:41:31.209 --> 00:41:34.610
versus with regular nappies. But actually if you, there

950
00:41:34.620 --> 00:41:36.600
are still ways to use cloth nappies, like if

951
00:41:36.610 --> 00:41:38.399
you're regularly tumble, drying them and things like that,

952
00:41:38.580 --> 00:41:41.639
that makes them less environmentally friendly than disposable. So

953
00:41:42.080 --> 00:41:44.510
I did, I, I crunched, I crunched all the

954
00:41:44.520 --> 00:41:46.139
data on that. And I, and I, there's a

955
00:41:46.149 --> 00:41:48.530
chapter on each thing and even just traveling the

956
00:41:48.540 --> 00:41:50.780
travel bit, I've kind of said, you know, if

957
00:41:50.790 --> 00:41:52.199
you really want to give up your car, there

958
00:41:52.209 --> 00:41:55.790
are different ways you can um the different kinds

959
00:41:55.800 --> 00:41:57.360
of bikes you can use for kids like ir

960
00:41:57.389 --> 00:42:00.340
real kind of detailed deep dive. But mainly the

961
00:42:00.350 --> 00:42:02.570
thing for me was to get people to think

962
00:42:02.580 --> 00:42:05.389
about those nuanced opinions rather than what they're being

963
00:42:05.399 --> 00:42:07.090
fed in these books, which I honestly think are

964
00:42:07.100 --> 00:42:09.479
quite dangerous. And at the time, there wasn't anything

965
00:42:09.489 --> 00:42:10.850
like it. That was the first kind of book

966
00:42:10.860 --> 00:42:12.649
of its kind. And actually I had to, I

967
00:42:12.659 --> 00:42:14.649
had a discussion with my uh publisher about it

968
00:42:14.659 --> 00:42:16.429
because I wanted a chapter on vaccines. And they

969
00:42:16.439 --> 00:42:18.590
said, wow, does that really fall under this? And

970
00:42:18.600 --> 00:42:20.129
I said, but the thing is all the competing

971
00:42:20.139 --> 00:42:23.889
books, do they do discuss vaccines? But it's all

972
00:42:23.899 --> 00:42:27.250
negative. It's saying there's so much mercury and, and

973
00:42:27.260 --> 00:42:29.679
autism and all this terrible stuff. That isn't true.

974
00:42:29.689 --> 00:42:32.679
Right. That vaccines do not cause autism and even

975
00:42:32.689 --> 00:42:35.070
if they did autism is not like, you know,

976
00:42:35.080 --> 00:42:37.479
a disease that is so evil. Like some people

977
00:42:37.489 --> 00:42:40.989
are autistic. It's ok. You know. Anyway, I, I

978
00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:42.649
really didn't like the way these books talked about

979
00:42:42.659 --> 00:42:45.570
those people. So II, I wrote it and I,

980
00:42:45.580 --> 00:42:47.389
and I actually had a huge, I had a

981
00:42:47.399 --> 00:42:50.469
huge backlash to that chapter about vaccinations. Huge. I

982
00:42:50.479 --> 00:42:52.580
had a, I had hate mail people leaving me

983
00:42:52.590 --> 00:42:54.389
one star reviews just because of that chapter. I

984
00:42:54.399 --> 00:42:56.669
even had people saying, hey, I liked all the

985
00:42:56.679 --> 00:42:59.239
other chapters pro you know, cos obviously they agreed

986
00:42:59.250 --> 00:43:01.260
with it but not, I don't like this. I,

987
00:43:01.270 --> 00:43:02.659
I had a little bit of push back on

988
00:43:02.669 --> 00:43:05.149
the home but saying no, it definitely is better

989
00:43:05.459 --> 00:43:07.989
and f you know, fine, some people aren't going

990
00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:09.590
to change their minds. But I hope that it,

991
00:43:10.199 --> 00:43:12.330
I think it did provide something for other people

992
00:43:12.340 --> 00:43:13.840
like me who just genuinely, you know, we just

993
00:43:13.850 --> 00:43:15.520
care about these issues and we think, oh, well,

994
00:43:15.530 --> 00:43:17.070
I'll just get this book. It's in the library

995
00:43:17.080 --> 00:43:18.860
or it's got good reviews in the Guardian. I

996
00:43:18.870 --> 00:43:21.439
read it because because of that and then they,

997
00:43:21.449 --> 00:43:24.060
they'd open it and they'd get lots of misinformation.

998
00:43:24.070 --> 00:43:27.300
And no, I think misinformation is a problem everywhere.

999
00:43:27.310 --> 00:43:29.250
But the main issue is when it's not counted

1000
00:43:29.260 --> 00:43:31.030
because then you just won't even see that. It's

1001
00:43:31.040 --> 00:43:33.060
misinformation, you have to be able to see counter

1002
00:43:33.080 --> 00:43:34.889
arguments, even if you then fall on this side

1003
00:43:34.989 --> 00:43:36.610
of the argument. Fine. You've made up your mind

1004
00:43:36.620 --> 00:43:37.750
but you have to be able to see it.

1005
00:43:37.760 --> 00:43:39.300
So, what I did was put that stuff out

1006
00:43:39.310 --> 00:43:41.100
there at a time when no one was really

1007
00:43:41.110 --> 00:43:45.330
doing it in those spaces. Um, SO, yeah, that's,

1008
00:43:45.340 --> 00:43:47.310
you know, and now I would say now it's

1009
00:43:47.320 --> 00:43:50.209
changed my opinions of what it means to be.

1010
00:43:50.219 --> 00:43:51.879
An ethical parent have changed a lot. You know,

1011
00:43:51.889 --> 00:43:54.750
I, my parents are, my kids are aware of

1012
00:43:55.389 --> 00:43:57.949
climate change but they, they're not, they're not anxious,

1013
00:43:57.959 --> 00:44:00.090
they're not anxious kids. They don't have e anxiety,

1014
00:44:00.100 --> 00:44:01.360
they're not like the end of the world is

1015
00:44:01.370 --> 00:44:04.429
happening. They're very aware of solutions and they think

1016
00:44:04.439 --> 00:44:06.040
around the problems. And I think I actually, we

1017
00:44:06.050 --> 00:44:08.219
really need younger generations to be doing that because

1018
00:44:08.229 --> 00:44:10.330
they will inherit quite a lot of problems as

1019
00:44:10.340 --> 00:44:11.679
they grow up. And we don't want them to

1020
00:44:11.689 --> 00:44:14.020
just freeze and say we're doomed and give up.

1021
00:44:14.030 --> 00:44:16.520
We want them to, to be really interested in,

1022
00:44:16.530 --> 00:44:19.399
in the solutions. Um And I think that's actually

1023
00:44:19.409 --> 00:44:21.209
for me, that's the more ethical way of doing

1024
00:44:21.219 --> 00:44:23.310
it. But, you know, ethics, ethics is a very

1025
00:44:23.320 --> 00:44:26.199
broad term and it means something different to everybody

1026
00:44:26.209 --> 00:44:29.679
and it's not, it's not, it's not data driven,

1027
00:44:29.689 --> 00:44:31.959
but that book is 100% data driven. I mean,

1028
00:44:31.969 --> 00:44:34.020
I read like 200 studies that are referenced in

1029
00:44:34.030 --> 00:44:35.600
the back in the back where I said I

1030
00:44:35.610 --> 00:44:37.679
have actually looked at these things that these other

1031
00:44:37.689 --> 00:44:41.560
books are saying and here is what, here's what

1032
00:44:41.570 --> 00:44:43.429
the science says and you can go away and

1033
00:44:43.439 --> 00:44:46.510
make up your own mind. But yeah, mainly it

1034
00:44:46.520 --> 00:44:48.989
was, it was a response to the, to the

1035
00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:51.340
prevailing kind of consensus of books out there that

1036
00:44:51.350 --> 00:44:51.979
I wrote that.

1037
00:44:52.949 --> 00:44:57.260
No, it really baffles me how so many environmentalists

1038
00:44:57.270 --> 00:45:03.399
activists particularly use the label natural as if anything

1039
00:45:03.409 --> 00:45:08.060
that's natural is good when disease is natural, death

1040
00:45:08.070 --> 00:45:11.000
is natural when it comes to birth. I mean,

1041
00:45:11.010 --> 00:45:15.439
infant mortality is natural as well. A mother mortality

1042
00:45:15.449 --> 00:45:18.270
or female mortality. So, I mean, I just,

1043
00:45:18.870 --> 00:45:21.830
it's interesting though because that it really, I think

1044
00:45:21.840 --> 00:45:25.590
influences a lot of people who, um, who don't

1045
00:45:25.600 --> 00:45:28.510
hold those beliefs in an extreme way but, but

1046
00:45:28.520 --> 00:45:30.739
it's, they've heard it so much that even so

1047
00:45:30.750 --> 00:45:32.330
that's why even a lot of people are people

1048
00:45:32.340 --> 00:45:34.800
who don't know a lot about electricity or electricity

1049
00:45:34.810 --> 00:45:37.429
generation. They will think, oh, well, isn't wind and

1050
00:45:37.439 --> 00:45:39.320
solar more natural? And I said, well, all of

1051
00:45:39.330 --> 00:45:42.590
it requires mining and materials and a workforce and

1052
00:45:42.780 --> 00:45:45.500
you know, people constructing that, you know, it's not,

1053
00:45:45.510 --> 00:45:48.669
you're not just getting energy from the sun, you're,

1054
00:45:48.679 --> 00:45:51.229
this is, this is, these are big pieces of

1055
00:45:51.409 --> 00:45:53.360
infrastructure and they say, oh, I hadn't really thought

1056
00:45:53.370 --> 00:45:54.780
about that, but I always think it's interesting that

1057
00:45:54.790 --> 00:45:57.070
they've assumed it's more natural and I don't know

1058
00:45:57.080 --> 00:45:58.810
why it would be more natural than, for example,

1059
00:45:58.820 --> 00:46:01.669
splitting the atom. Um It's a real, it's really

1060
00:46:01.679 --> 00:46:04.149
just an ideology that seeped into quite a lot

1061
00:46:04.159 --> 00:46:07.290
of people's thinking until it's challenged again, that misinformation

1062
00:46:07.300 --> 00:46:09.739
just lives in there, kind of rent free. And

1063
00:46:09.750 --> 00:46:11.010
then when it's challenged, a lot of people will

1064
00:46:11.020 --> 00:46:12.340
say, oh, yeah, I didn't think of that, but

1065
00:46:12.350 --> 00:46:15.760
it's amazing to me how far that natural terminology

1066
00:46:15.770 --> 00:46:18.489
has gone. Same with GMO S, right. It's another

1067
00:46:18.500 --> 00:46:20.639
thing I talk about, people say, oh, well, they,

1068
00:46:20.649 --> 00:46:22.179
they're not, they're not natural. And I said, well,

1069
00:46:22.189 --> 00:46:25.629
why don't they cause XYZ problems? Well, no, you,

1070
00:46:25.639 --> 00:46:27.780
you have food on your plate because we have

1071
00:46:27.790 --> 00:46:31.199
GE gene editing genetic, you know, we should be,

1072
00:46:31.209 --> 00:46:32.850
we should be thankful for this, this is a

1073
00:46:32.860 --> 00:46:36.669
good thing. But again that these fear, fearful stories

1074
00:46:36.679 --> 00:46:39.070
and ideas of what's natural versus what isn't really

1075
00:46:39.080 --> 00:46:41.110
seeped into people's brains. But actually, if you look

1076
00:46:41.120 --> 00:46:43.754
at around you, nothing is natural. Nothing, not even

1077
00:46:43.764 --> 00:46:46.495
landscapes, you know, not even, I mean, not even

1078
00:46:46.514 --> 00:46:49.455
the hillsides and that we've engineered our entire environment,

1079
00:46:49.465 --> 00:46:51.905
right? We, we're really honest about it. Um, AND

1080
00:46:51.915 --> 00:46:54.344
that's ok because that's if, if we do it,

1081
00:46:54.465 --> 00:46:56.715
surely it is natural. We're part of nature. That's,

1082
00:46:56.725 --> 00:46:59.514
that's the arguments I make. But you have to

1083
00:46:59.524 --> 00:47:00.725
do a lot of thinking to get there, I

1084
00:47:00.735 --> 00:47:02.544
think. And, uh, yeah, a lot of people just

1085
00:47:02.554 --> 00:47:05.334
land on this old idea of. Uh, IN fact,

1086
00:47:05.344 --> 00:47:07.254
I saw something recently, which I thought was interesting,

1087
00:47:07.264 --> 00:47:09.024
which is a you gov poll. It's like a

1088
00:47:09.750 --> 00:47:12.479
independent data survey here in the UK. And it

1089
00:47:12.489 --> 00:47:16.169
asked people, um, if they thought, you know, previous

1090
00:47:16.179 --> 00:47:18.899
generation life was better for previous generations. A lot

1091
00:47:18.909 --> 00:47:20.560
of them said, you know, no, you know, a

1092
00:47:20.570 --> 00:47:23.320
lot to be fair, you know, 70% no life

1093
00:47:23.330 --> 00:47:25.620
is better now. But you'd be surprised. A chunk

1094
00:47:25.629 --> 00:47:27.389
of people that said life was better in the

1095
00:47:27.399 --> 00:47:31.780
17th century and the 18th century, you'd be surprised.

1096
00:47:31.790 --> 00:47:33.419
You know, and I know I've known those people

1097
00:47:33.429 --> 00:47:34.679
so I believe it. But I could see a

1098
00:47:34.689 --> 00:47:36.600
lot of people in the comments on this, this

1099
00:47:36.610 --> 00:47:39.379
uh this data, like who believes that what? You'd

1100
00:47:39.389 --> 00:47:42.500
be surprised. A lot of these really hardcore environmentalists

1101
00:47:42.510 --> 00:47:45.379
or activists that is really what they believe. They

1102
00:47:45.389 --> 00:47:47.340
re, it's not a myth to say they think

1103
00:47:47.350 --> 00:47:49.040
we should go back to living on the land

1104
00:47:49.050 --> 00:47:52.070
in poverty. They, they really think that's better for

1105
00:47:52.080 --> 00:47:54.860
the planet and for, well, not for people but

1106
00:47:54.870 --> 00:47:55.629
for the planet.

1107
00:47:56.820 --> 00:47:59.840
Yeah. May maybe they should go back to and

1108
00:47:59.850 --> 00:48:03.870
to a gathering because agriculture is also not natural.

1109
00:48:04.120 --> 00:48:05.929
Well, you know, some of them, I mean, again,

1110
00:48:05.939 --> 00:48:08.239
I maybe I've known the more extreme wing but

1111
00:48:08.250 --> 00:48:10.100
I, some of them do you know? So I

1112
00:48:10.110 --> 00:48:13.409
know someone in London, uh who was a spokesperson

1113
00:48:13.429 --> 00:48:16.300
in the rebellion who is not on the grid.

1114
00:48:16.439 --> 00:48:19.030
He has solar panels when they run out. He

1115
00:48:19.040 --> 00:48:21.260
has, he just lives without, he doesn't use a

1116
00:48:21.270 --> 00:48:24.030
flush toilet. He uses his garden and he has

1117
00:48:24.040 --> 00:48:27.350
a compost loo and um he doesn't have a

1118
00:48:27.360 --> 00:48:30.860
fridge. So cos you know, he, he has, he,

1119
00:48:30.870 --> 00:48:34.199
he lives with internet. So his view is everyone

1120
00:48:34.209 --> 00:48:36.050
could live like this because I live like this.

1121
00:48:36.570 --> 00:48:41.760
My view visiting there was um nobody wants to

1122
00:48:41.770 --> 00:48:44.159
live like this. Like I have relatives in India

1123
00:48:44.169 --> 00:48:46.550
living in poverty who are forced to live like

1124
00:48:46.560 --> 00:48:48.800
this, who do not want to live like this.

1125
00:48:48.820 --> 00:48:52.250
But also it's a very high maintenance lifestyle. This

1126
00:48:52.260 --> 00:48:54.729
idea that it's like slow and natural and lovely

1127
00:48:54.739 --> 00:48:56.280
is not like he's having to do a lot

1128
00:48:56.290 --> 00:48:58.800
of work. Um And a lot of mental labor

1129
00:48:58.810 --> 00:49:00.689
I would say to, you know, if you buy

1130
00:49:00.699 --> 00:49:02.600
butter, how long is it going to last for

1131
00:49:02.610 --> 00:49:05.449
without a fridge? You know, when can he cook?

1132
00:49:05.459 --> 00:49:07.479
It can only cook it when there's enough solar

1133
00:49:07.489 --> 00:49:10.320
generation. So he's going by the weather and fine,

1134
00:49:10.330 --> 00:49:12.149
that's his lifestyle. But he lives a very middle

1135
00:49:12.159 --> 00:49:14.040
class lifestyle. He's able to do that because he

1136
00:49:14.050 --> 00:49:15.959
doesn't, you know, he's paid off his house and

1137
00:49:15.969 --> 00:49:17.270
he doesn't have a job and he doesn't have

1138
00:49:17.280 --> 00:49:20.620
Children. That's not most people, most of us cannot

1139
00:49:20.629 --> 00:49:23.919
live like that, you know. Um So yeah, it's

1140
00:49:23.929 --> 00:49:25.560
this real bubble of and I would say there

1141
00:49:25.570 --> 00:49:28.129
are very privileged kind of wealthy people who are

1142
00:49:28.139 --> 00:49:30.449
doing it so we can do it. Everyone can

1143
00:49:30.459 --> 00:49:32.489
do it. Um, I can tell you a funny

1144
00:49:32.500 --> 00:49:34.530
story. Years ago I got, I got invited to

1145
00:49:34.540 --> 00:49:36.719
meet to, um, go see these hippies out at

1146
00:49:36.729 --> 00:49:39.449
this place called Stewards Wood. So they're basically, there's

1147
00:49:39.459 --> 00:49:41.790
a national park here where I live, um, called

1148
00:49:41.800 --> 00:49:44.229
D Dart. No, Ma Dartmoor National Park. And they

1149
00:49:44.239 --> 00:49:46.629
set up camp there and the council wanted to

1150
00:49:46.639 --> 00:49:48.435
evict them because it's a to live there. And

1151
00:49:48.445 --> 00:49:49.774
they said, well, we've got in the land, we're

1152
00:49:49.784 --> 00:49:51.514
living on the land and there was a legal

1153
00:49:51.524 --> 00:49:53.185
case and you know, I was in with the

1154
00:49:53.195 --> 00:49:55.274
hippies. So all the hippies say it's, it's outrageous.

1155
00:49:55.284 --> 00:49:57.165
They shouldn't kick them off. They're living sustainably. So

1156
00:49:57.175 --> 00:49:58.205
I thought I'm gonna go down there and I'm

1157
00:49:58.215 --> 00:49:59.625
going to write an article, I'm gonna help the

1158
00:49:59.635 --> 00:50:01.564
cause. So I went down there to write an

1159
00:50:01.574 --> 00:50:05.419
article and help the cause I was absolutely heartbroken

1160
00:50:05.429 --> 00:50:07.860
because they were not living off the land. They

1161
00:50:07.870 --> 00:50:11.070
were getting huge grocery deliveries from Tesco, you know,

1162
00:50:11.080 --> 00:50:14.060
from, from Sainsbury's huge deliveries that would have to,

1163
00:50:14.070 --> 00:50:15.469
they'd have to pay for extra petrol because they

1164
00:50:15.479 --> 00:50:16.909
had to come so far out in the middle

1165
00:50:16.919 --> 00:50:20.110
of nowhere. Um They, they, yeah, they had a

1166
00:50:20.120 --> 00:50:21.979
few chickens, they had a few chickens, they had

1167
00:50:21.989 --> 00:50:23.969
a few eggs from, you know, they were growing

1168
00:50:23.979 --> 00:50:26.459
a few vegetables very little though. Very little of

1169
00:50:26.469 --> 00:50:29.340
it. Um Fine. They were using water from a

1170
00:50:29.350 --> 00:50:32.169
nearby river. Ok. Fine. So they weren't connected, they

1171
00:50:32.179 --> 00:50:33.879
weren't connected to the grid at all. So they

1172
00:50:33.889 --> 00:50:36.010
were doing little bits and pieces. But I would

1173
00:50:36.020 --> 00:50:38.560
say their carbon footprint was way higher than anyone

1174
00:50:38.570 --> 00:50:40.550
living in a city. I mean, while I was

1175
00:50:40.560 --> 00:50:43.320
there interviewing one of them, this guy's name was

1176
00:50:43.330 --> 00:50:46.260
Merlin. Right. I was interviewing him. What's the lifestyle

1177
00:50:46.270 --> 00:50:48.270
like? Why should you be allowed to stay here?

1178
00:50:48.370 --> 00:50:50.530
He said he had to like answer the phone.

1179
00:50:50.540 --> 00:50:52.899
He said his mum had, his mum was here.

1180
00:50:53.060 --> 00:50:54.560
So I went out to have a look and

1181
00:50:54.570 --> 00:50:57.379
his mum had come to pick up his laundry

1182
00:50:58.239 --> 00:51:00.540
to take it home and wash it in a

1183
00:51:00.550 --> 00:51:02.790
washing machine and dry it in a tumble dryer.

1184
00:51:02.800 --> 00:51:04.929
I'm not exaggerating. This is a true story and

1185
00:51:04.939 --> 00:51:06.709
bring it back. So, and she had to dry

1186
00:51:06.719 --> 00:51:08.129
from the city. So it was a 40 minute

1187
00:51:08.139 --> 00:51:10.899
drive each way. She's washing and tumble, drying it

1188
00:51:10.909 --> 00:51:12.639
because they didn't have a way to wash clothes.

1189
00:51:13.270 --> 00:51:16.350
They didn't want to spend all day washing clothes

1190
00:51:16.360 --> 00:51:18.600
and then drying damp clothes indoors. I mean, it's

1191
00:51:18.610 --> 00:51:20.300
very wet here. So you'll be lucky if you

1192
00:51:20.310 --> 00:51:23.330
can dry them outdoors. Um And, and every few

1193
00:51:23.340 --> 00:51:25.310
days she'd do this. So they all had this,

1194
00:51:25.320 --> 00:51:30.060
this whole community was relying on ordinary civilization but

1195
00:51:30.070 --> 00:51:32.020
claiming, oh, we're off grid and we don't need

1196
00:51:32.030 --> 00:51:33.669
any of that. So as soon as I saw

1197
00:51:33.679 --> 00:51:35.010
it was a lie, I didn't write about it

1198
00:51:35.020 --> 00:51:37.379
at all. Um, AND I was nice enough not

1199
00:51:37.389 --> 00:51:39.340
to go away and write a horrible piece about

1200
00:51:39.350 --> 00:51:41.949
it. Um, BUT that's what I, that's what I

1201
00:51:41.959 --> 00:51:44.260
saw from that community and I think, you know,

1202
00:51:44.270 --> 00:51:46.320
it's a lie. Really, isn't it? Even the people

1203
00:51:46.330 --> 00:51:49.219
that have the means and the energy and time

1204
00:51:49.229 --> 00:51:51.260
to do it, they're not able to do it

1205
00:51:51.270 --> 00:51:54.060
and they were eventually evicted simply because they were

1206
00:51:54.070 --> 00:51:56.209
told if they could show that they were living,

1207
00:51:56.310 --> 00:51:59.620
you know, sustainably within certain parameters, they actually might

1208
00:51:59.629 --> 00:52:01.020
be able to stay and they couldn't meet those

1209
00:52:01.030 --> 00:52:05.889
parameters because they couldn't sustain a lifestyle themselves. They

1210
00:52:05.899 --> 00:52:08.020
couldn't provide them, they couldn't provide enough food for

1211
00:52:08.030 --> 00:52:12.100
themselves. They couldn't. So, and who, who was picking

1212
00:52:12.110 --> 00:52:14.330
up their waste? The council was having to pick

1213
00:52:14.340 --> 00:52:16.449
up their waste. So when you live in ordinary

1214
00:52:16.459 --> 00:52:18.850
society, you have to pay right in my tax

1215
00:52:18.860 --> 00:52:20.919
money, it comes out, they pick up my recycling

1216
00:52:20.929 --> 00:52:22.689
and my waste. Well, they were, they were basically

1217
00:52:22.699 --> 00:52:24.129
refusing to do that because they were living on

1218
00:52:24.139 --> 00:52:26.209
the land saying we're sustainable, but they were just,

1219
00:52:26.219 --> 00:52:27.679
it was piling up. So the council had to

1220
00:52:27.689 --> 00:52:28.689
pick it up. So there were a lot of

1221
00:52:28.699 --> 00:52:31.179
problems there. We kind of go if only there

1222
00:52:31.189 --> 00:52:32.929
was a solution to this. It is, it's called

1223
00:52:32.939 --> 00:52:35.199
living in this city where I live. All of

1224
00:52:35.209 --> 00:52:37.310
these problems are solved and my carbon program is

1225
00:52:37.320 --> 00:52:41.840
much lower, much lower because, you know, it's just

1226
00:52:41.850 --> 00:52:45.120
much lo, uh, yeah, anyway, many different reasons. But

1227
00:52:45.129 --> 00:52:47.189
especially the f, the food, you know, and actually

1228
00:52:47.199 --> 00:52:49.300
I get my, some of my vegetables I get

1229
00:52:49.310 --> 00:52:51.370
from a local farm which is fairly sustainable because

1230
00:52:51.379 --> 00:52:53.659
they drop them off to a farmers market, which

1231
00:52:53.669 --> 00:52:55.100
they do every week. Anyway, lots of people pick

1232
00:52:55.110 --> 00:52:57.300
up the food there and that, you know, in

1233
00:52:57.310 --> 00:52:59.020
a small way, I do that. Uh I, I

1234
00:52:59.030 --> 00:53:00.989
think it's better. I'm supporting the local farmer. I

1235
00:53:01.000 --> 00:53:03.540
know the guy. He's a great guy, but that's

1236
00:53:03.550 --> 00:53:05.790
not gonna feed everyone. I'm not under an illusion

1237
00:53:05.800 --> 00:53:07.209
that just because I got a little bit there,

1238
00:53:07.219 --> 00:53:08.689
it is gonna feed everyone in the same way.

1239
00:53:08.699 --> 00:53:10.239
We can't be in an illusion just because it's

1240
00:53:10.250 --> 00:53:11.850
really windy today and we have lots of wind

1241
00:53:11.860 --> 00:53:13.739
power that's gonna be every day forever. The amount

1242
00:53:13.750 --> 00:53:15.510
of journalists that were saying that was shocking to

1243
00:53:15.520 --> 00:53:17.209
me because they were saying this is the future

1244
00:53:17.219 --> 00:53:18.320
and I was like, what do you know about

1245
00:53:18.330 --> 00:53:20.159
the future that it's gonna be windy every day?

1246
00:53:20.169 --> 00:53:22.189
You know? Do you know that about the future?

1247
00:53:22.199 --> 00:53:23.899
What they were saying was, if we build more,

1248
00:53:23.909 --> 00:53:25.750
we'll get more. But that's not, that's not how

1249
00:53:25.760 --> 00:53:28.360
it works, right? Because we're not controlling the weather.

1250
00:53:28.689 --> 00:53:31.189
I know you understand that. But these, you know,

1251
00:53:31.199 --> 00:53:33.520
quite high fi genist didn't understand it. So I

1252
00:53:33.909 --> 00:53:36.310
had a few conversations with people about it, but

1253
00:53:37.080 --> 00:53:39.250
that's where, you know, the nuance of the conversation

1254
00:53:39.260 --> 00:53:41.689
needs to happen and it's not happening. And I

1255
00:53:41.699 --> 00:53:43.270
really think we need to move forward into that

1256
00:53:43.280 --> 00:53:46.030
bit because you can't implement solutions if you're still

1257
00:53:46.040 --> 00:53:49.590
stuck on myths, uh essentially believing myths.

1258
00:53:50.709 --> 00:53:53.830
So just to wrap up our conversation, let me

1259
00:53:53.840 --> 00:53:56.729
ask you one final question. So when it comes

1260
00:53:56.739 --> 00:53:59.649
to climate change and the ways we can tackle

1261
00:53:59.659 --> 00:54:02.250
it, of course, we talked here a lot about

1262
00:54:02.260 --> 00:54:05.649
technological solutions. But of course, there would be other

1263
00:54:05.659 --> 00:54:10.330
kinds of systemic solutions through politics, regulations and all

1264
00:54:10.340 --> 00:54:13.050
of that. But uh I mean, another set of

1265
00:54:13.060 --> 00:54:16.875
solutions that we've also touched on and many of

1266
00:54:16.885 --> 00:54:20.865
the activists focus the most on uh occur at

1267
00:54:20.875 --> 00:54:24.345
an individual level like changing some of our habits

1268
00:54:24.355 --> 00:54:26.266
and all of that. But I mean, that, that's

1269
00:54:26.275 --> 00:54:28.506
all great and it's great when people do that.

1270
00:54:28.516 --> 00:54:31.275
But at the same time, sometimes it seems that

1271
00:54:31.426 --> 00:54:34.615
activists tend to be a little bit more realistic

1272
00:54:34.625 --> 00:54:37.535
when it comes to, oh, you should do this,

1273
00:54:37.545 --> 00:54:39.996
you should stop doing that and so on. And

1274
00:54:40.006 --> 00:54:44.261
they think that we can solve most of the

1275
00:54:44.271 --> 00:54:48.802
issue if people just stopped, I don't know, driving

1276
00:54:48.812 --> 00:54:54.602
or using or started using evs or uh taking

1277
00:54:54.612 --> 00:54:58.041
shorter showers or something like that. So uh how

1278
00:54:58.052 --> 00:55:00.852
do you balance perhaps uh or what do you

1279
00:55:00.862 --> 00:55:03.842
think is most important here? I mean, what we

1280
00:55:03.852 --> 00:55:06.481
can do at an individual level or on a

1281
00:55:06.491 --> 00:55:07.602
systemic level.

1282
00:55:09.110 --> 00:55:12.830
So, I mean, on an individual level, I don't

1283
00:55:12.840 --> 00:55:15.090
think it makes that much difference. Most of these

1284
00:55:15.100 --> 00:55:17.760
things just don't, I mean, yeah. All right, switch

1285
00:55:17.770 --> 00:55:19.989
to an ev drive a bit less, get a

1286
00:55:20.000 --> 00:55:23.780
bike fine. There's still really small amount and I

1287
00:55:23.790 --> 00:55:25.669
know what people say. If everybody does it, it's

1288
00:55:25.679 --> 00:55:28.610
more, again, they're doing that in Germany, they still

1289
00:55:28.620 --> 00:55:30.750
need a lot of electricity and they're still having

1290
00:55:30.760 --> 00:55:32.659
to use coal to power that. So we have

1291
00:55:32.669 --> 00:55:35.040
a case study. I'm not saying we shouldn't do

1292
00:55:35.050 --> 00:55:37.080
these common sense things and some things are more,

1293
00:55:37.149 --> 00:55:40.540
more um some things are more obvious than others.

1294
00:55:40.550 --> 00:55:42.070
So one thing that we don't talk about enough,

1295
00:55:42.080 --> 00:55:44.550
I think is insulating houses. So in the UK,

1296
00:55:44.560 --> 00:55:47.149
you know, we have really terrible insulation, the house,

1297
00:55:47.159 --> 00:55:48.649
the homeowner has to pay for it. So there's

1298
00:55:48.659 --> 00:55:51.290
no real incentive, but a lot of houses are

1299
00:55:51.300 --> 00:55:54.379
drafty. Um And cost a lot of money now.

1300
00:55:54.389 --> 00:55:56.070
All right, fine. If the homeowner could put up

1301
00:55:56.080 --> 00:55:57.510
money, they will do it because it will save

1302
00:55:57.520 --> 00:55:59.590
them money in the long run because they have

1303
00:55:59.600 --> 00:56:02.120
less damp and they use less electricity. But actually

1304
00:56:02.129 --> 00:56:03.699
a lot of people are landlords, a lot of

1305
00:56:03.709 --> 00:56:05.860
people are renting from landlords and the landlords have

1306
00:56:05.870 --> 00:56:08.110
no incentive to do it. There's some things like

1307
00:56:08.120 --> 00:56:10.300
that really simple, which they have done well in

1308
00:56:10.310 --> 00:56:14.750
Germany to incentivize or provide money for, um, or,

1309
00:56:14.760 --> 00:56:16.689
you know, loans for people to be able to

1310
00:56:16.699 --> 00:56:18.570
do that. It's a really obvious thing because we

1311
00:56:18.580 --> 00:56:22.199
are just leaking heat. We're, we're wasting heat, you

1312
00:56:22.209 --> 00:56:24.959
know, uh, in quite a dominantly cold country. I

1313
00:56:24.969 --> 00:56:26.479
know it's not as cold as other countries but

1314
00:56:26.489 --> 00:56:28.010
it feels like it's very cold here all the

1315
00:56:28.020 --> 00:56:30.479
time. Um, AND we do have very drafty damp

1316
00:56:30.760 --> 00:56:33.389
houses so that, that's, you know, a simple thing.

1317
00:56:33.639 --> 00:56:36.989
Um There is a move towards electrification that does

1318
00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:38.590
need to happen. And again, I know a lot

1319
00:56:38.600 --> 00:56:40.489
of people don't like the idea, but it just

1320
00:56:40.500 --> 00:56:42.229
does need to happen. It's common sense. We need

1321
00:56:42.239 --> 00:56:44.649
to electrify everything and then we need to have

1322
00:56:44.659 --> 00:56:47.169
a clean electricity grid. That's, that's a big chunk.

1323
00:56:47.179 --> 00:56:48.199
It's not all of the problems, it's a big

1324
00:56:48.209 --> 00:56:50.429
chunk of the problem. But in terms of individual

1325
00:56:50.439 --> 00:56:53.270
actions, honestly, I would say talking about the solutions

1326
00:56:53.280 --> 00:56:57.310
is really important. Um And fighting for solutions is

1327
00:56:57.320 --> 00:56:59.679
really important because historically, we've always had people that

1328
00:56:59.689 --> 00:57:01.729
fight on the basis of problems. That's what activists

1329
00:57:01.739 --> 00:57:03.889
do, right? You find the problem and you focus

1330
00:57:03.899 --> 00:57:06.919
on the problem that doesn't solve the problem. And

1331
00:57:06.929 --> 00:57:10.209
you know that what you need is the instigators

1332
00:57:10.219 --> 00:57:13.270
and the change makers who actually care about the

1333
00:57:13.280 --> 00:57:16.530
evidence, care about the scientific solutions to push those

1334
00:57:16.540 --> 00:57:17.899
words and you have got people doing it. Some

1335
00:57:17.909 --> 00:57:20.610
really important people like James Hanson, um you know,

1336
00:57:20.620 --> 00:57:23.320
the grandfather of climate change as people like to

1337
00:57:23.330 --> 00:57:25.770
call him. He, he's a big advocate for nuclear

1338
00:57:25.780 --> 00:57:27.500
na. And one of the things he says is

1339
00:57:27.639 --> 00:57:29.500
that to young people, his message to young people,

1340
00:57:29.510 --> 00:57:32.000
the most important thing you do um is work

1341
00:57:32.010 --> 00:57:34.729
in the nuclear industry. That's what he said. Um

1342
00:57:35.110 --> 00:57:38.489
Which, yeah, ok. We need engineers and builders and

1343
00:57:38.899 --> 00:57:42.100
my, my thoughts and wishes are not going to,

1344
00:57:42.110 --> 00:57:45.159
to solve today's problems. It is the engineers and

1345
00:57:45.169 --> 00:57:47.149
the builders that are going to do it. Politicians

1346
00:57:47.159 --> 00:57:49.250
can make sure those things are implemented and that

1347
00:57:49.260 --> 00:57:50.860
we, we can use that as a pressure point.

1348
00:57:50.870 --> 00:57:52.629
So in terms of in individual action, we should

1349
00:57:52.639 --> 00:57:55.719
have those conversations with politicians. I'm not saying send

1350
00:57:55.729 --> 00:57:58.459
your MP hate mail. I'm saying have conversations because

1351
00:57:58.469 --> 00:58:00.540
a lot of them um actually when I started

1352
00:58:00.550 --> 00:58:02.350
talking about, about nuclear, I reached out to a

1353
00:58:02.360 --> 00:58:06.250
lot of them here, journalists, editors, politicians, and actually

1354
00:58:06.260 --> 00:58:08.699
a lot of them said privately they already agreed.

1355
00:58:08.709 --> 00:58:09.959
And I said, well, why don't you write or

1356
00:58:09.969 --> 00:58:12.110
talk about it or the public doesn't want to?

1357
00:58:12.250 --> 00:58:14.469
So, ok, I'm gonna go and commission some, some

1358
00:58:14.479 --> 00:58:16.520
data here and find out what the public wants.

1359
00:58:16.540 --> 00:58:18.310
Ok. It's come back and it said actually, they

1360
00:58:18.320 --> 00:58:20.479
really support this. Will you talk about it now?

1361
00:58:20.489 --> 00:58:22.709
And then they started to, but they only know

1362
00:58:23.389 --> 00:58:25.870
um what the public thinks about often. They don't

1363
00:58:25.879 --> 00:58:27.629
look, they're not even looking at data points, right?

1364
00:58:27.639 --> 00:58:30.000
They're not scientifically literate people. They're just looking at

1365
00:58:30.010 --> 00:58:32.120
their emails and when they open their emails, they

1366
00:58:32.129 --> 00:58:34.739
get 50 people saying I hate the fact that

1367
00:58:34.750 --> 00:58:36.770
you're putting in an EV pump in my area.

1368
00:58:37.209 --> 00:58:39.489
They think nobody wants this. We shouldn't do this.

1369
00:58:39.500 --> 00:58:41.580
We sh you know, that, that really is how,

1370
00:58:41.590 --> 00:58:44.060
that, that's, that's a, you know, one of the

1371
00:58:44.070 --> 00:58:46.590
flaws of democracy, that's just how it works. It's

1372
00:58:46.600 --> 00:58:49.030
people powered, but it's all the negatives. So we

1373
00:58:49.040 --> 00:58:52.389
really need people to send in those emails and

1374
00:58:52.399 --> 00:58:54.540
say, actually, I think this is a really good

1375
00:58:54.550 --> 00:58:56.520
idea that you have a low traffic neighborhood, for

1376
00:58:56.530 --> 00:58:58.699
example, or that you're putting in the EV pumps

1377
00:58:58.709 --> 00:59:02.179
or you know, what measures are you taking practical

1378
00:59:02.189 --> 00:59:04.979
measures? And do you support clean energy? Um Even

1379
00:59:04.989 --> 00:59:06.709
if it's not in your region, it's important that

1380
00:59:06.719 --> 00:59:08.750
people are talking about it and know what solutions

1381
00:59:08.760 --> 00:59:10.709
are. And I speak to some quite high level

1382
00:59:10.719 --> 00:59:14.350
individuals who don't know and they'll literally uh hop

1383
00:59:14.360 --> 00:59:16.459
on a call and they'll say, can you explain

1384
00:59:16.469 --> 00:59:17.889
to me why we need nuclear? I mean that

1385
00:59:17.899 --> 00:59:21.370
that's where we're starting. Um What's wrong with what's

1386
00:59:21.379 --> 00:59:25.030
wrong with coal? All right. OK. Um You'd be

1387
00:59:25.040 --> 00:59:27.110
surpri you'd be surprised. I'm not talking about ordinary

1388
00:59:27.120 --> 00:59:28.810
lay people. I'm talking about people in high positions

1389
00:59:28.820 --> 00:59:32.010
of power. So those conversations are so important and,

1390
00:59:32.020 --> 00:59:34.810
and it also, so my, my answer to your

1391
00:59:34.820 --> 00:59:38.389
question is talk about solutions because also um there

1392
00:59:38.399 --> 00:59:40.620
is so much hyper focus on the negatives and

1393
00:59:40.629 --> 00:59:43.649
the problems and that's still really prevalent. And then

1394
00:59:43.659 --> 00:59:46.620
when you do hear solutions like, hey, we're excited

1395
00:59:46.629 --> 00:59:49.389
cos it's so windy today. They're false, they're false

1396
00:59:49.399 --> 00:59:52.050
solutions because it's simplified. It makes a good story

1397
00:59:52.060 --> 00:59:54.469
or a good slogan. Well, the solutions aren't actually

1398
00:59:54.479 --> 00:59:57.620
good stories and slogans are really quite complicated. So

1399
00:59:57.629 --> 00:59:59.530
we need people who talk about the nuance and

1400
00:59:59.540 --> 01:00:01.500
the data and talk about it to key figures

1401
01:00:01.510 --> 01:00:05.139
like local representatives, you know, use a demo democratic

1402
01:00:05.149 --> 01:00:08.360
process um or get, get involved, go to meetings

1403
01:00:08.370 --> 01:00:10.770
and have a voice. Um AND, and speak to

1404
01:00:10.780 --> 01:00:14.370
different audiences, you know, speak to speak to people

1405
01:00:14.379 --> 01:00:18.729
who maybe aren't that interested in electricity, but they

1406
01:00:18.739 --> 01:00:20.719
care about climate change cos they're not, that's not

1407
01:00:20.729 --> 01:00:23.689
being added up. They just think. Well, I, I

1408
01:00:23.699 --> 01:00:25.659
use my bike today so it's fine. Well, actually

1409
01:00:25.669 --> 01:00:29.520
the, the systemic problems are far bigger, much bigger.

1410
01:00:29.649 --> 01:00:33.239
Um And if we implement big solutions, then that's

1411
01:00:33.250 --> 01:00:35.409
gonna have way more of an impact than, you

1412
01:00:35.419 --> 01:00:39.629
know, um putting on one less wash cycle a

1413
01:00:39.639 --> 01:00:41.889
week, that's just the truth, isn't it? You can

1414
01:00:41.899 --> 01:00:43.649
still put on one lash wash cycle a week

1415
01:00:43.659 --> 01:00:45.709
if you want to. But all of us doing

1416
01:00:45.719 --> 01:00:48.750
it isn't going to, it isn't going to make

1417
01:00:48.760 --> 01:00:51.729
her dad right on, on the emissions. It's just

1418
01:00:51.739 --> 01:00:53.520
not going to make a dent. What's going to

1419
01:00:53.530 --> 01:00:55.520
make a dent is we'll bring lots of clean

1420
01:00:55.530 --> 01:00:58.709
energy. That's, that's it and then electrifying as much

1421
01:00:58.719 --> 01:00:59.949
as we can so we can get off the

1422
01:00:59.959 --> 01:01:02.750
re the remaining fossil fuels. Um It's not a

1423
01:01:02.760 --> 01:01:05.129
complicated message, but it's still a message that needs

1424
01:01:05.139 --> 01:01:07.790
to be put out there because it's um I

1425
01:01:07.800 --> 01:01:12.050
think it's not um it's still not countering that

1426
01:01:12.060 --> 01:01:14.350
apocalyptic dude. My narrative enough.

1427
01:01:16.159 --> 01:01:20.030
Great. So let's send that message. And where can

1428
01:01:20.040 --> 01:01:21.679
people find you on the

1429
01:01:22.139 --> 01:01:33.620
internet? Like I was, I've done a piece on,

1430
01:01:33.750 --> 01:01:35.969
on uh the need for gas in low income

1431
01:01:36.409 --> 01:01:39.919
countries, things like that. Um And they're heavily referenced.

1432
01:01:39.929 --> 01:01:41.090
So, you know, don't, you don't have to take

1433
01:01:41.100 --> 01:01:42.649
my word for it on these calls. I always

1434
01:01:42.659 --> 01:01:45.199
say anything that I say in any podcast interview,

1435
01:01:45.290 --> 01:01:46.510
you can go and have a look at the

1436
01:01:46.520 --> 01:01:48.229
article and you can click the links and it

1437
01:01:48.239 --> 01:01:50.550
will take you to the source and you can

1438
01:01:50.560 --> 01:01:52.250
look at the data and I urge people to

1439
01:01:52.260 --> 01:01:53.810
do that because I think a lot of people

1440
01:01:53.820 --> 01:01:57.010
get um you know, like uh they feel like,

1441
01:01:57.020 --> 01:01:59.120
oh with science, it's too complicated. It's not for

1442
01:01:59.129 --> 01:02:00.719
me. And I said that that's not true. You

1443
01:02:00.729 --> 01:02:03.020
know, anyone can understand some of these really basic

1444
01:02:03.030 --> 01:02:04.989
concepts. You just need to know where to look

1445
01:02:05.030 --> 01:02:09.060
and to understand the difference between, you know, um

1446
01:02:09.850 --> 01:02:13.429
some, it's some blog post that, that says, so

1447
01:02:13.439 --> 01:02:17.250
it's, you know, uh the sun is causing climate

1448
01:02:17.260 --> 01:02:20.189
change and the sun will fix it whatever arguments

1449
01:02:20.199 --> 01:02:22.820
people are making. Um And actually look at oh

1450
01:02:22.830 --> 01:02:25.949
our wood and data or the IPCC or, you

1451
01:02:25.959 --> 01:02:29.310
know, any the, the UN data or anywhere that

1452
01:02:29.320 --> 01:02:32.750
puts out really good numbers. Um AND good summaries

1453
01:02:32.760 --> 01:02:35.459
of those for the people that aren't so mathematically

1454
01:02:35.469 --> 01:02:39.459
inclined as well. But yeah, I would urge people

1455
01:02:39.469 --> 01:02:40.000
to have a look.

1456
01:02:40.610 --> 01:02:42.959
Great. So I'm leaving links to that in the

1457
01:02:42.969 --> 01:02:45.659
