00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:03.319
Hello everyone. Welcome to a new episode of The

2
00:00:03.319 --> 00:00:06.679
Dissenter. I'm your host, as always, Ricardo Lopes, and

3
00:00:06.679 --> 00:00:10.319
today I'm joined by Doctor Ashley Randall. She's professor

4
00:00:10.319 --> 00:00:13.460
in the School of Counseling and Counseling Psychology at

5
00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:17.520
Arizona State University. And today we're going to talk

6
00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.600
about relationship science, sexual minority and gender diverse individuals

7
00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:26.530
in romantic relationships, and some other related topics. So,

8
00:00:26.799 --> 00:00:29.120
Doctor Randall, welcome to the show. It's a huge

9
00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:30.159
pleasure to everyone.

10
00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:32.799
Thank you so much for having me, Ricardo.

11
00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:37.270
So before we get into the more specific topics,

12
00:00:37.369 --> 00:00:41.009
let me just start with a more general question.

13
00:00:41.169 --> 00:00:45.610
So what is relationship science and what kinds of

14
00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:47.209
questions do you tackle there?

15
00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:50.200
Yeah, so this is a great question and one

16
00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:53.400
that I hope will really entice everyone to fall

17
00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:56.900
in love, um, no pun intended, with relationship science.

18
00:00:57.599 --> 00:01:03.040
Essentially, relationship science is the discovery of how it

19
00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:08.500
is that people or groups, um, either initiate, form.

20
00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:13.269
Engage in relationship maintenance behaviors and unfortunately, right, we

21
00:01:13.269 --> 00:01:15.760
know that not all relationships work out, and so

22
00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:19.160
there's also elements of studying relationship dissolution or breakup.

23
00:01:19.279 --> 00:01:22.360
Yet essentially, if you think about all the relationships

24
00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:24.680
that we have in the world, whether that be

25
00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:29.544
with our parents, our caregivers, our siblings. Neighbors, friends,

26
00:01:29.625 --> 00:01:32.944
romantic partner, employees, you can kind of go on

27
00:01:32.944 --> 00:01:36.864
and on. Um, WE and relationship science study all

28
00:01:36.864 --> 00:01:39.584
of these elements and, and try to understand what

29
00:01:39.584 --> 00:01:44.745
really makes people have good, healthy, and, uh, beneficial

30
00:01:44.745 --> 00:01:45.925
relationships in their lives.

31
00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:51.599
And so you study the experiences of sexual minority

32
00:01:51.599 --> 00:01:55.459
and gender diverse individuals in romantic relationships. I mean,

33
00:01:55.879 --> 00:01:59.599
what got you interested in that topic specifically? Is

34
00:01:59.599 --> 00:02:04.400
it because they constitute a group of marginalized individuals

35
00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:07.599
that perhaps do not receive too much attention in

36
00:02:07.599 --> 00:02:12.220
relationship science, or do they have any particular interesting

37
00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:14.279
traits or some other reason?

38
00:02:15.029 --> 00:02:17.949
Yes, um, so a little bit of, um, both

39
00:02:17.949 --> 00:02:19.990
professional and personal, so I think that one of

40
00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:22.830
the things we always think about is that oftentimes

41
00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:25.059
people study things that are important or, you know,

42
00:02:25.179 --> 00:02:27.509
salient to their own identity and so that's one

43
00:02:27.509 --> 00:02:30.949
element for me, um, of studying, uh, sexual minority

44
00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:35.119
individuals, yeah, from a, you know, more. SCIENTIFIC and

45
00:02:35.119 --> 00:02:38.380
um professional side of things is that I started

46
00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:40.460
my career really looking at the role of stress

47
00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:44.539
in close relationships and without any defining factors of

48
00:02:44.539 --> 00:02:47.369
trying to understand, well, for certain groups of couples,

49
00:02:47.419 --> 00:02:50.639
are these how processes may work out or for

50
00:02:50.779 --> 00:02:54.559
under certain context, how do things, you know, uh,

51
00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:58.220
necessarily matriculate. And so I think that in doing

52
00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:00.820
the research and as I continued to grow as

53
00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:03.460
a scholar and collaborate with others is that my

54
00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:06.059
mind really started to expand thanks to the help

55
00:03:06.059 --> 00:03:09.100
of collaborators and um talks and everything like that

56
00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:12.759
that I've been engaging with with continuing education. Of

57
00:03:12.759 --> 00:03:16.039
really trying to elevate the voices of those who

58
00:03:16.039 --> 00:03:20.199
have been traditionally underrepresented in our science and of

59
00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:23.720
particular interest, um, has become the role of the

60
00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:27.539
lived experiences of sexual minority and gender diverse individuals

61
00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:30.720
and myself, along with many collaborators really look at

62
00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:33.279
this also from a global lens, um, because we

63
00:03:33.279 --> 00:03:37.240
know that unfortunately, there's uh a predominant voice of

64
00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:40.639
those who identify. Um, AS white and those who

65
00:03:40.639 --> 00:03:43.559
come from, uh, North America or currently living in

66
00:03:43.559 --> 00:03:46.919
North America that are overrepresented. And so it's really

67
00:03:46.919 --> 00:03:49.960
with the, the thought of elevating those voices that,

68
00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:53.199
um, are so incredibly important that have, right, some

69
00:03:53.199 --> 00:03:57.619
of these disparaging, um, situations that may predispose them

70
00:03:57.619 --> 00:04:02.789
negatively to psychological, um, physical health issues, etc. um,

71
00:04:02.839 --> 00:04:05.119
THAT I really started to pivot and, and look

72
00:04:05.119 --> 00:04:06.860
towards, uh, these topics.

73
00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:10.009
Yes, and please correct me if I'm wrong, but

74
00:04:10.009 --> 00:04:13.970
I would imagine that relationship sciences with other kinds

75
00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:19.329
of behavioral or psychological sciences, must be perhaps focused

76
00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:24.748
on. Uh, HETEROSEXUAL couples because they constitute the majority

77
00:04:24.748 --> 00:04:29.148
and so I would imagine that perhaps studying sexual

78
00:04:29.148 --> 00:04:34.709
minority and gender diverse individuals would also expand uh

79
00:04:34.709 --> 00:04:38.859
the view we have of uh romantic relationships,

80
00:04:39.188 --> 00:04:41.628
correct? Absolutely, Ricardo, and I think that like, you

81
00:04:41.628 --> 00:04:43.308
know, I mean, it's an interesting question because I

82
00:04:43.308 --> 00:04:45.389
think the data is a little bit more challenging

83
00:04:45.389 --> 00:04:48.109
to try to pin down, um, obviously because of.

84
00:04:48.165 --> 00:04:51.364
Uh, SOCIOPOLITICAL climates all over the globe about whom

85
00:04:51.364 --> 00:04:54.404
identifies as such. Yet one of the things that

86
00:04:54.404 --> 00:04:57.005
we know from scholars, not myself, but certainly prior

87
00:04:57.005 --> 00:05:00.644
work, um, is that the relationship components of how

88
00:05:00.644 --> 00:05:04.605
people engage in daily, you know, engage in daily

89
00:05:04.605 --> 00:05:07.125
functioning, so to speak, of their relationships are quite

90
00:05:07.125 --> 00:05:11.125
similar amongst those that identify as heterosexual and are

91
00:05:11.125 --> 00:05:14.644
in a relationship with, um, you know, a same

92
00:05:15.204 --> 00:05:18.220
same gendered person. Um, AND so it's really trying

93
00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:21.760
to then not necessarily understand what's going on within,

94
00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:25.609
right, that relationship, but trying to understand the broader,

95
00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:30.279
uh, systemic factors that impact individuals within those relationships.

96
00:05:31.119 --> 00:05:35.000
And so, you mentioned briefly that you were interested

97
00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:40.220
in stress theory. So what is minority stress theory

98
00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:44.820
and how does it impact, uh, romantic relationships?

99
00:05:45.279 --> 00:05:48.200
Excellent question. So Ricardo, as you probably are quite

100
00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:50.119
familiar with and hopefully the viewers as well, is

101
00:05:50.119 --> 00:05:52.799
that all good questions originate from a theory or

102
00:05:52.799 --> 00:05:55.279
a framework which helps guide us in terms of

103
00:05:55.279 --> 00:05:57.079
how it is that we, um, you know, view

104
00:05:57.079 --> 00:05:59.420
the world and, and view the lens. So one

105
00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:02.859
of the predominant theories that we look at in

106
00:06:02.859 --> 00:06:06.010
our research is minority stress theory. And this is

107
00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:10.290
a term that has become quite popular by Elan

108
00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:13.010
Meyer and colleagues, but we certainly want to acknowledge

109
00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:17.010
previous and historical contributions or prior contributions rather from

110
00:06:17.010 --> 00:06:20.630
Brooks and colleagues. But essentially what minority stress theory

111
00:06:20.769 --> 00:06:26.079
posits is that because of one's identity. That they

112
00:06:26.079 --> 00:06:31.320
may be predisposed to experiencing stress in their social

113
00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:34.119
environments. Now, in this case, minority stress theory would

114
00:06:34.119 --> 00:06:37.679
posit that if one holds any type of minority

115
00:06:37.679 --> 00:06:41.339
identity in a majority culture or a majority society,

116
00:06:41.839 --> 00:06:46.279
then because of laws, regulations, maybe even viewpoints of

117
00:06:46.279 --> 00:06:49.959
the predominant majority, that that could predispose them to

118
00:06:49.959 --> 00:06:54.970
stress. So, in our context, looking at um identifying

119
00:06:54.970 --> 00:06:58.920
as lesbian, gay, or bisexual, that um could be

120
00:06:59.179 --> 00:07:03.119
an element, certainly of a minoritized identity. And so

121
00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:07.214
within living in a heteronormative society, these individuals are

122
00:07:07.214 --> 00:07:12.054
actually predisposed to greater reports of stress because of

123
00:07:12.054 --> 00:07:16.454
elements of potential lack of belonging, um, increased discrimination

124
00:07:16.454 --> 00:07:19.725
or higher reports of discrimination in the workplace, um,

125
00:07:19.815 --> 00:07:21.894
lack of family acceptance, etc.

126
00:07:22.779 --> 00:07:27.540
Mhm. And how does uh minority stre, what are

127
00:07:27.540 --> 00:07:33.239
the implications of minority stress for understanding uh how

128
00:07:34.019 --> 00:07:39.140
stress impacts the relationship from outside and from within

129
00:07:39.140 --> 00:07:43.299
in the case of outside, for example, the context

130
00:07:43.299 --> 00:07:46.220
of the workplace and other places like that. So

131
00:07:46.220 --> 00:07:47.679
could you tell us about that?

132
00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:51.380
Yes, absolutely. So one of the things that um

133
00:07:51.380 --> 00:07:54.829
that people may not. Um, I would say explicitly

134
00:07:54.829 --> 00:07:58.149
think about, is that we have different sources of

135
00:07:58.149 --> 00:08:00.220
stress. So even Ricardo, if I ask you, like,

136
00:08:00.230 --> 00:08:02.149
what stresses you out, you don't have to answer

137
00:08:02.149 --> 00:08:05.470
that, um, yet, what stresses you out, you may

138
00:08:05.470 --> 00:08:09.950
think of something that is, right, solely affecting you,

139
00:08:10.070 --> 00:08:13.390
something that's affecting yourself and your family members, what

140
00:08:13.390 --> 00:08:16.339
have you. Yet there are two different sources of

141
00:08:16.339 --> 00:08:18.899
stress that my colleague and I have identified, or

142
00:08:18.899 --> 00:08:21.940
at least um identified through the literature, um, which

143
00:08:21.940 --> 00:08:25.179
are those stressors that happen outside of the relationship,

144
00:08:25.299 --> 00:08:28.220
which we think about as external stressors, which would

145
00:08:28.220 --> 00:08:30.660
be the examples of discrimination and everything as you

146
00:08:30.660 --> 00:08:34.419
noted, and alternatively, there's stress inside the relationship, right?

147
00:08:34.500 --> 00:08:37.500
So differing partner goals, um, annoying habits from one's

148
00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:41.450
partner, etc. Yet what people fail to realize is

149
00:08:41.450 --> 00:08:45.969
that oftentimes, we start to compartmentalize, and understandably so,

150
00:08:46.049 --> 00:08:47.770
our lives, and please know that I'm coming from

151
00:08:47.770 --> 00:08:51.049
an individualistic uh culture and and perspective in that

152
00:08:51.049 --> 00:08:54.450
regard, um, wherein it's, this has something to do

153
00:08:54.450 --> 00:08:56.710
with work, has nothing to do with my relationship.

154
00:08:57.640 --> 00:09:00.320
Well, what's interesting is that we often bring our

155
00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:03.619
stress home, not surprising, right? So that way, we

156
00:09:03.619 --> 00:09:08.280
are either verbally or non-verbally communicating how these outside

157
00:09:08.280 --> 00:09:11.960
experiences are affecting us now and how we're bringing

158
00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:15.320
those into the home environment. So while minority stress

159
00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:18.359
theory would help us identify some of those outside

160
00:09:18.359 --> 00:09:23.659
or external stressors, it's constructs like stress spillover. And

161
00:09:23.659 --> 00:09:27.099
stress crossover that allow us to really understand how

162
00:09:27.099 --> 00:09:30.940
stress can spill over from outside the relationship to

163
00:09:30.940 --> 00:09:34.739
inside the relationship, and then also crossover from my

164
00:09:34.739 --> 00:09:37.090
experience to my partner's experience as well.

165
00:09:38.590 --> 00:09:43.000
And how do couples in general deal with stress?

166
00:09:44.789 --> 00:09:46.750
Well, this is a great question, and I wish

167
00:09:46.750 --> 00:09:49.190
that I had one overarching answer for all of

168
00:09:49.190 --> 00:09:52.669
this. However, um, as any good scientist would probably

169
00:09:52.669 --> 00:09:55.070
say, it depends, right? It depends on a lot

170
00:09:55.070 --> 00:09:58.739
of factors, it depends on a lot of ways

171
00:09:58.739 --> 00:10:01.989
in which couples have identified within their even their

172
00:10:01.989 --> 00:10:06.229
subsystem of what works. Now, from an empirical side

173
00:10:06.229 --> 00:10:08.710
of things, what we have determined is that it's

174
00:10:08.710 --> 00:10:14.299
incredibly important. That partners verbalize their stress to their

175
00:10:14.299 --> 00:10:18.580
partner. Now John Gottman and colleagues have often thought

176
00:10:18.580 --> 00:10:22.219
that upwards of 93% of our communication is nonverbal.

177
00:10:22.309 --> 00:10:24.940
So if we come home and we're upset and

178
00:10:24.940 --> 00:10:27.739
we're not talking to our partner, we are immediately

179
00:10:27.739 --> 00:10:30.340
going into the office or immediately jumping on a

180
00:10:30.340 --> 00:10:34.330
phone call. Or what have you, and not engaging,

181
00:10:34.570 --> 00:10:37.179
we're still communicating, right? We're communicating that we don't

182
00:10:37.179 --> 00:10:40.619
have time to engage with our partners. So it's

183
00:10:40.619 --> 00:10:44.500
very important that we have couples rely on that

184
00:10:44.500 --> 00:10:47.539
7% of verbal communication, because what we find in

185
00:10:47.539 --> 00:10:50.330
the literature is that if couples are able to

186
00:10:50.330 --> 00:10:53.419
communicate verbally to their stress, their partner is then

187
00:10:53.419 --> 00:10:56.979
better equipped to then actually provide that support to

188
00:10:56.979 --> 00:10:58.500
them in a positive manner.

189
00:11:00.179 --> 00:11:03.250
And when it comes to dealing with stress, are

190
00:11:03.250 --> 00:11:07.130
there any particularities of being part of a social

191
00:11:07.130 --> 00:11:10.929
minority that people have to deal with?

192
00:11:11.909 --> 00:11:15.119
Absolutely, right. So, Ricardo, we had noted just in

193
00:11:15.119 --> 00:11:18.419
terms of the earlier example of minority stress theory.

194
00:11:18.809 --> 00:11:22.270
Yet, if we think with inside the individual, um,

195
00:11:22.359 --> 00:11:25.320
there are sources of stress that pertain to one's

196
00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:28.960
like identity, right? So some individuals, and I'm predominantly

197
00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:33.479
talking about sexual minority individuals, they could have negative

198
00:11:33.479 --> 00:11:38.239
thoughts or, you know, experiences about their own identity

199
00:11:38.239 --> 00:11:41.799
in the context of a larger community setting. So,

200
00:11:42.109 --> 00:11:45.909
that term is often referred to as internalized homophobia,

201
00:11:46.109 --> 00:11:50.020
meaning I have internalized what it, like the negative

202
00:11:50.020 --> 00:11:51.950
aspects of what it may mean to be a

203
00:11:51.950 --> 00:11:55.429
sexual minority individual because of my outside sources and

204
00:11:55.429 --> 00:11:58.869
my outside community. Then if we start to broaden

205
00:11:58.869 --> 00:12:01.590
out the individual perspective to look at the family

206
00:12:01.590 --> 00:12:05.690
unit, um, certainly sources of stress could be surrounding,

207
00:12:05.909 --> 00:12:09.630
um, you know, not being accepted for one's sexual

208
00:12:09.630 --> 00:12:13.630
orientation, um, not being accepted, um, not only within

209
00:12:13.630 --> 00:12:16.349
the immediate family unit, but within the larger family

210
00:12:16.349 --> 00:12:20.179
unit. If we think about community elements, um, if

211
00:12:20.179 --> 00:12:24.609
one is living in a predominantly conservative community, um,

212
00:12:24.619 --> 00:12:28.419
or predominantly conservative culture, there may actually be both

213
00:12:28.419 --> 00:12:32.010
implicit and explicit laws that preclude them from engaging

214
00:12:32.010 --> 00:12:35.530
in that behavior and engaging in those relationships. So

215
00:12:35.530 --> 00:12:37.690
what you can see from just those, you know,

216
00:12:37.849 --> 00:12:40.250
quick, um, examples is that there really is a

217
00:12:40.250 --> 00:12:44.280
multiplicative effect of how much stress can then be,

218
00:12:44.530 --> 00:12:47.450
um, you know, affecting these individuals and, and of

219
00:12:47.450 --> 00:12:50.890
course I'm ignoring uh quite a large um statement

220
00:12:50.890 --> 00:12:53.369
point of, you know, we can look across the

221
00:12:53.369 --> 00:12:56.630
globe in terms of our sociopolitical climates to understand,

222
00:12:56.650 --> 00:12:59.010
um, some of the targets that these individuals are

223
00:12:59.010 --> 00:13:01.090
either directly or indirectly facing.

224
00:13:01.750 --> 00:13:05.049
Mhm, YES, I and I would imagine also things

225
00:13:05.049 --> 00:13:09.549
like social condemnation because I mean people who are

226
00:13:09.549 --> 00:13:14.270
part of uh same-sex couples, for example, or have

227
00:13:14.270 --> 00:13:19.479
some sort of gender identity that is minoritarian. Tend

228
00:13:19.479 --> 00:13:23.599
to be more or at least more than the

229
00:13:23.599 --> 00:13:28.479
general population tend to be targets of discrimination and

230
00:13:28.479 --> 00:13:34.080
social condemnation because of their minority identities,

231
00:13:34.320 --> 00:13:36.799
right? Absolutely, absolutely.

232
00:13:37.869 --> 00:13:42.880
Um, AND what is the relationship between sexual orientation,

233
00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:46.820
discrimination, something that I was sort of alluding to,

234
00:13:47.080 --> 00:13:50.659
and depression among same-sex couples.

235
00:13:51.159 --> 00:13:54.200
Yes, well, Ricardo, it would probably not surprise anyone

236
00:13:54.599 --> 00:13:57.969
that if we are um experiencing or if individuals

237
00:13:57.969 --> 00:14:02.440
are experiencing higher, you know, rates of discrimination, higher

238
00:14:02.440 --> 00:14:05.539
rates of internalized homophobia, that what we have found

239
00:14:06.390 --> 00:14:09.039
in our research, and these are partnered individuals, so

240
00:14:09.039 --> 00:14:11.679
even though they're in a romantic relationship. AND have

241
00:14:11.679 --> 00:14:15.200
that um hopefully support buffer in place is that

242
00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:20.359
we're still finding associations and positive associations between those

243
00:14:20.359 --> 00:14:25.000
experiences and individual reports of depression, anxiety, and even

244
00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:28.359
generalized stress. So said differently is that it's not

245
00:14:28.359 --> 00:14:32.630
surprising if individuals. Or groups of individuals whom 1

246
00:14:32.630 --> 00:14:35.969
may come across to say, I'm not really feeling

247
00:14:35.969 --> 00:14:38.630
like that great. I'm not really feeling like myself.

248
00:14:38.710 --> 00:14:42.309
I'm, I'm having trouble, right, having motivation. I feel

249
00:14:42.309 --> 00:14:45.590
anxious in these situations. And then if we look

250
00:14:45.590 --> 00:14:48.770
to see, well, are you also experiencing, you know,

251
00:14:49.270 --> 00:14:52.750
elements of discrimination in your life or internalized homophobia,

252
00:14:53.030 --> 00:14:55.830
it's not surprising that we're seeing that that association

253
00:14:55.830 --> 00:14:56.289
exists.

254
00:14:57.979 --> 00:15:01.140
And I would imagine that, I mean, because of

255
00:15:01.140 --> 00:15:06.260
discrimination, discrimination can affect the, in certain cases, the

256
00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:10.380
relationship itself, right in the sense that if people

257
00:15:10.380 --> 00:15:15.059
feel socially discriminated because of the kind of romantic

258
00:15:15.059 --> 00:15:20.380
relationship they have, they might start having negative feelings

259
00:15:20.380 --> 00:15:24.299
about the relationship itself. Is, I mean, is that

260
00:15:24.299 --> 00:15:25.640
something that happens or?

261
00:15:26.200 --> 00:15:28.679
Absolutely, Ricardo. I mean, and it's not surprising, right?

262
00:15:28.799 --> 00:15:31.419
So I think sometimes we would like to think

263
00:15:31.640 --> 00:15:33.679
um that we exist in a vacuum, so to

264
00:15:33.679 --> 00:15:36.440
speak, or that our experiences don't impact others, yet

265
00:15:36.440 --> 00:15:40.760
that's absolutely impossible because we're social beings, right? We're

266
00:15:40.760 --> 00:15:45.190
constantly interacting with others, um, we are seeing individuals,

267
00:15:45.289 --> 00:15:47.830
um, maybe even for a second, a more engaging

268
00:15:47.830 --> 00:15:50.719
and longer conversations, but we're still impacted by those

269
00:15:50.719 --> 00:15:54.450
dynamics. And so because of how much partners are

270
00:15:54.450 --> 00:15:58.159
connected with one another and share that interdependence, um,

271
00:15:58.250 --> 00:16:01.609
it is not surprising then that those negative experiences

272
00:16:01.609 --> 00:16:05.000
can not only affect, like myself as an example,

273
00:16:05.210 --> 00:16:07.969
but they can also negatively impact my partner's outcomes

274
00:16:07.969 --> 00:16:08.549
as well.

275
00:16:09.309 --> 00:16:13.640
Mhm. And can depression be mitigated? And if so,

276
00:16:14.010 --> 00:16:16.969
which factors play a role in that mitigation?

277
00:16:18.010 --> 00:16:21.190
So depression can absolutely be mitigated, and Ricardo, just

278
00:16:21.190 --> 00:16:24.190
to um not bore the, the listeners of this

279
00:16:24.190 --> 00:16:26.489
podcast of how long we could go on about

280
00:16:26.489 --> 00:16:28.330
this, I'm gonna broaden it or bring it in

281
00:16:28.330 --> 00:16:30.090
a little bit just in terms of the context

282
00:16:30.090 --> 00:16:33.809
that we're talking about, um, in that one of

283
00:16:33.809 --> 00:16:35.960
the areas that we focus on in our research

284
00:16:35.960 --> 00:16:40.669
is really operating from a strength-based perspective, meaning, We

285
00:16:40.669 --> 00:16:44.909
recognize that these negative, um, constructs or negative ideas

286
00:16:44.909 --> 00:16:48.669
exist or, or negative experiences exist rather. Yet what

287
00:16:48.669 --> 00:16:50.200
it is that we try to do is say,

288
00:16:50.630 --> 00:16:53.570
because these exist, are there things that we can

289
00:16:55.059 --> 00:16:58.070
Have couples, have individuals who are in relationships think

290
00:16:58.070 --> 00:17:01.489
about to actually offset some of these negative experiences.

291
00:17:01.950 --> 00:17:03.789
And a lot of the work that we've done,

292
00:17:03.989 --> 00:17:06.589
um, both here within the US and then also

293
00:17:06.589 --> 00:17:09.229
from a global perspective as well, is look at

294
00:17:09.229 --> 00:17:12.910
the role of dyadic coping. And what this means

295
00:17:12.910 --> 00:17:15.069
is that if I'm in a relationship with my

296
00:17:15.069 --> 00:17:18.848
partner, And we are that unit that I mentioned,

297
00:17:19.180 --> 00:17:21.660
is that my experiences of stress and how I'm

298
00:17:21.660 --> 00:17:24.300
gonna cope with these things are really reliant on

299
00:17:24.300 --> 00:17:27.209
my partner as well, so we're a team. So

300
00:17:27.209 --> 00:17:28.650
one of the things that we look at is

301
00:17:28.650 --> 00:17:31.239
that if I am then communicating that stress to

302
00:17:31.239 --> 00:17:35.010
my partner, and my partner then responds positively to

303
00:17:35.010 --> 00:17:38.530
me, not saying that's great that you're stressed, yet

304
00:17:38.530 --> 00:17:41.719
rather, how can I help you, maybe think about

305
00:17:41.719 --> 00:17:44.265
some of these things. I'm really sorry that's. Happening,

306
00:17:44.314 --> 00:17:47.435
how can I emotionally support you? What we find

307
00:17:47.435 --> 00:17:51.194
is that those levels of depression and general reports

308
00:17:51.194 --> 00:17:54.594
of stress and anxiety are actually decreased. So it's

309
00:17:54.594 --> 00:17:57.515
really looking towards how we can encourage couples to

310
00:17:57.515 --> 00:18:00.574
communicate about these stressors, because it not only has

311
00:18:01.194 --> 00:18:04.045
impacts for oneself, but also the relationship.

312
00:18:05.489 --> 00:18:07.849
Yes, and I would imagine that in this particular

313
00:18:07.849 --> 00:18:13.469
case, because usually it would be both partners experiencing

314
00:18:15.449 --> 00:18:20.329
depression due to discrimination that they would tend to

315
00:18:20.329 --> 00:18:24.569
be a little bit more understanding. Toward each other,

316
00:18:24.630 --> 00:18:29.569
I mean, because they're both experiencing similar things, correct?

317
00:18:30.050 --> 00:18:32.810
Yeah, perhaps, Ricardo, and there's a lot of really

318
00:18:32.810 --> 00:18:35.449
interesting um research that I think still needs to

319
00:18:35.449 --> 00:18:38.849
be done, of course, is that there's this idea,

320
00:18:38.969 --> 00:18:43.520
right, of understanding. If one partner identifies as such,

321
00:18:43.770 --> 00:18:47.410
right, how does that other partner's identity also impact

322
00:18:47.410 --> 00:18:50.890
their joint experiences? So what we are starting to

323
00:18:50.890 --> 00:18:52.290
do with some of the data that we have

324
00:18:52.290 --> 00:18:55.290
is to look at if one partner identifies as

325
00:18:55.290 --> 00:18:58.630
a sexual minority individual, so lesbian, gay, or bisexual,

326
00:18:58.930 --> 00:19:02.599
the other partner may identify as heterosexual, right? Because

327
00:19:02.609 --> 00:19:05.290
we can be attracted to different people. So in

328
00:19:05.290 --> 00:19:09.310
those. Context, just from a sexual orientation identity perspective,

329
00:19:09.680 --> 00:19:14.250
are we seeing different relationship, um, maintenance behaviors, so

330
00:19:14.250 --> 00:19:16.849
behaviors that, you know, continue to allow the relationship

331
00:19:16.849 --> 00:19:19.729
to continue? Are we seeing different dynamics on a

332
00:19:19.729 --> 00:19:24.890
daily perspective? And essentially, ultimately, what are the resources

333
00:19:24.890 --> 00:19:29.089
that we can have based on empirical science to

334
00:19:29.089 --> 00:19:32.709
help people live healthy and happy lives?

335
00:19:34.319 --> 00:19:38.030
So what is the advice you would give couples

336
00:19:38.030 --> 00:19:41.520
who are facing stress, particularly if they are part

337
00:19:41.520 --> 00:19:43.479
of a minority?

338
00:19:44.239 --> 00:19:46.959
This is a great question. And I often say

339
00:19:46.959 --> 00:19:48.699
that if I could figure out how to solve

340
00:19:48.920 --> 00:19:51.670
for everyone not to have stress, then, um, that

341
00:19:51.670 --> 00:19:53.680
would be the ideal situation, and I think it's

342
00:19:53.680 --> 00:19:56.520
quite a lofty goal. Um, SO that being said

343
00:19:56.520 --> 00:20:00.000
is that I think one, recognizing and owning one's

344
00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:04.199
experience. Um, ONE has to realize that unfortunately, there

345
00:20:04.199 --> 00:20:06.680
are a multitude of stressors that exist in the

346
00:20:06.680 --> 00:20:09.920
world, and, um, it's almost at times trying to

347
00:20:09.920 --> 00:20:12.665
figure out. What are the stressors and, and what

348
00:20:12.665 --> 00:20:15.265
is it, not only the stressors that I'm experiencing,

349
00:20:15.344 --> 00:20:18.864
but why are these so stressful for me? And

350
00:20:18.864 --> 00:20:20.224
I know that that may seem a little bit

351
00:20:20.224 --> 00:20:23.974
counterintuitive, yet all of us may have missed a

352
00:20:23.974 --> 00:20:26.984
deadline, um, or all of us may have had

353
00:20:26.984 --> 00:20:31.479
a troubling interaction with a family member. Ricardo, like

354
00:20:31.479 --> 00:20:34.140
if you have that stress, that might mean something

355
00:20:34.310 --> 00:20:36.040
a little bit different for you than it would

356
00:20:36.040 --> 00:20:40.040
for me. So I think one, turning inward and

357
00:20:40.040 --> 00:20:42.660
trying to understand why is this so important for

358
00:20:42.660 --> 00:20:44.800
me, or what is the stress that's really going

359
00:20:44.800 --> 00:20:49.219
on. And then having time to then communicate that

360
00:20:49.219 --> 00:20:52.939
to one's romantic partner and even one's community of

361
00:20:52.939 --> 00:20:55.020
support, right? So I think that it's important to

362
00:20:55.020 --> 00:20:58.780
think about, um, that we surround ourselves with, you

363
00:20:58.780 --> 00:21:02.260
know, high-quality relationships, and it's the quality, not the

364
00:21:02.260 --> 00:21:04.900
quantity. So I think being able to identify those

365
00:21:04.900 --> 00:21:08.739
stressors and then communicating to those that we think

366
00:21:08.739 --> 00:21:10.939
will be able to provide us that support, and

367
00:21:10.939 --> 00:21:13.439
I think also telling people, this is what I

368
00:21:13.439 --> 00:21:16.180
need. I need you to just listen, right? Or

369
00:21:16.180 --> 00:21:17.699
I need you to help me figure this out,

370
00:21:17.839 --> 00:21:20.300
because oftentimes we assume what people want and then

371
00:21:20.300 --> 00:21:23.540
we may start offering suggestions, but in actuality, that's

372
00:21:23.540 --> 00:21:24.420
not what people need.

373
00:21:25.109 --> 00:21:29.709
Mhm. And where can individuals go if they are

374
00:21:29.709 --> 00:21:33.530
interested in these topics, the topics we covered today?

375
00:21:34.260 --> 00:21:37.270
Yeah, absolutely, Ricardo. So one, I'm self-serving. I'm happy

376
00:21:37.270 --> 00:21:39.180
to, of course, to share a link to a

377
00:21:39.180 --> 00:21:41.819
website or any publications that I have. There are

378
00:21:41.819 --> 00:21:46.569
also some phenomenal resources um through the American Psychological

379
00:21:46.569 --> 00:21:50.979
Association, um, website. And so under the American Psychological

380
00:21:50.979 --> 00:21:54.500
Association website, there are different divisions and so in

381
00:21:54.500 --> 00:21:59.010
particular Division 17, the Society of Counseling Psychology. Uh,

382
00:21:59.170 --> 00:22:02.119
Division 44, the Society of Sexual Orientation and Gender

383
00:22:02.119 --> 00:22:06.609
Diversity, and even Society, uh, excuse me, Division 52,

384
00:22:06.890 --> 00:22:10.209
the Society for Global Psychology, all of these different

385
00:22:10.209 --> 00:22:14.400
societies will have relevant resources particular to these groups,

386
00:22:14.489 --> 00:22:16.489
so I would encourage individuals to check those out.

387
00:22:17.719 --> 00:22:20.760
Great, and if people are interested, where can they

388
00:22:20.760 --> 00:22:23.550

389
00:22:24.160 --> 00:22:27.229
