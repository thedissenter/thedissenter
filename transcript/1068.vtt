00:00:00.239 --> 00:00:02.809
Hello, everyone. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:02.809 --> 00:00:05.760
Dissenter. I'm your host, as always, Ricardo Wabson to

3
00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:09.520
the MGN by Doctor Kristen Gosi. She's an award-winning

4
00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:12.119
author and professor and chair of Russian and East

5
00:00:12.119 --> 00:00:15.680
European Studies at the University of Pennsylvania. She is

6
00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:18.500
the author of Many different books, but today we're

7
00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:22.850
going to talk about why women have better sex

8
00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:27.649
and socialism and other arguments for economic independence. So,

9
00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:30.329
Doctor Goy, welcome to the show. It's a pleasure

10
00:00:30.329 --> 00:00:30.969
to everyone.

11
00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:32.849
Thanks so much for inviting me.

12
00:00:33.819 --> 00:00:37.659
OK, so let me start by asking you because

13
00:00:37.659 --> 00:00:41.540
uh I imagine that some people will be taken

14
00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:44.409
aback by the title of your book. So what

15
00:00:44.409 --> 00:00:46.409
is the its premise?

16
00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:50.250
So, I mean, the basic premise is pretty simple.

17
00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:56.830
It's that when women have Economic autonomy when they

18
00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:59.509
can actually take care of themselves. They live in

19
00:00:59.509 --> 00:01:03.150
a society which supports them and supports their roles

20
00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:07.989
in societies, that they choose their partners, their romantic

21
00:01:07.989 --> 00:01:13.029
partners in particular, out of love and affection and

22
00:01:13.029 --> 00:01:17.980
shared interests or mutual inclinations, rather than the ability

23
00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:22.139
of that romantic partner to pay the bills. And

24
00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:28.839
so, Yeah. Basically, when you are free, uh, in

25
00:01:28.839 --> 00:01:32.239
terms of you're not worrying about whether you have

26
00:01:32.239 --> 00:01:35.199
enough food to eat, or whether, you know, you

27
00:01:35.199 --> 00:01:37.839
don't have a place to live or whether, you

28
00:01:37.839 --> 00:01:40.160
know, you can survive and see the doctor or

29
00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:42.800
see the take care of your children, you're going

30
00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:44.980
to make a different set of choices. You're essentially

31
00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:47.660
more free in your life. And you're going to

32
00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:50.419
choose your partner on a different set of criteria

33
00:01:50.419 --> 00:01:53.339
rather than in a society where you have very

34
00:01:53.339 --> 00:01:55.260
limited rights and the only way that you can

35
00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:58.169
guarantee a basic social safety net is to find

36
00:01:58.169 --> 00:01:59.900
a partner who has a lot of money and

37
00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:01.580
is willing to spend it on you and your

38
00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.900
children.

39
00:02:03.089 --> 00:02:06.830
Mhm. So, uh, I also want to ask you

40
00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:09.970
about the specific definition here, which I think is

41
00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:13.009
important because in the book, you talk a lot

42
00:02:13.009 --> 00:02:16.250
about the social impacts of the political and economic

43
00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:21.330
transition from state socialism to capitalism in Eastern European

44
00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:24.490
countries. So what is state socialism?

45
00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.649
Yeah, so that's a kind of a clunky term,

46
00:02:27.779 --> 00:02:32.339
um, that I had to use because originally when

47
00:02:32.339 --> 00:02:35.419
this book was written, it was during the first

48
00:02:35.419 --> 00:02:40.389
Trump administration, and it was for a largely American

49
00:02:40.389 --> 00:02:44.929
audience. I had absolutely no idea at the time

50
00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:48.699
that it would, like, have 15 translations, and then

51
00:02:48.699 --> 00:02:51.809
I would have to be explaining my terminology to

52
00:02:51.809 --> 00:02:55.970
um people who know better. But so because Americans

53
00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:59.649
don't understand socialism generally speaking. And so the reason

54
00:02:59.649 --> 00:03:02.970
I use the term state socialism in the book

55
00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:08.410
was specifically to distinguish between the 20th century socialist

56
00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:11.250
countries in Eastern Europe, what they themselves would have

57
00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:16.419
called really existing socialist countries, versus the democratic socialist

58
00:03:16.419 --> 00:03:20.000
countries of of Scandinavia. And these are countries where

59
00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.600
you still have much more of a market in,

60
00:03:22.779 --> 00:03:23.779
you know, sort of more of a like kind

61
00:03:23.779 --> 00:03:25.830
of a market socialism sort of thing going on,

62
00:03:25.839 --> 00:03:29.089
but you also have guaranteed democratic freedoms and a

63
00:03:29.089 --> 00:03:32.059
parliamentary system with free and fair and open elections,

64
00:03:32.339 --> 00:03:35.100
which was a different system than existed in Eastern

65
00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:37.580
Europe. So it was a way of trying to

66
00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:39.979
distinguish between what was going on in Eastern Europe

67
00:03:39.979 --> 00:03:43.199
and what was going on in Scandinavia. Um, BUT

68
00:03:43.199 --> 00:03:46.759
essentially, the, the reason I use this term, and

69
00:03:46.759 --> 00:03:49.429
I think it's very important for the Marxists among

70
00:03:49.429 --> 00:03:53.800
people, um, among your listeners, is that if you're

71
00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:57.039
a very orthodox Marxist, you understand that socialism is

72
00:03:57.039 --> 00:04:02.759
a transitory stage between capitalism and ultimately communism. And

73
00:04:02.759 --> 00:04:05.600
so countries in Eastern Europe, with a very few

74
00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:11.149
exceptions were led by communist parties. So they called

75
00:04:11.149 --> 00:04:14.729
themselves the Bulgarian Communist Party, right? With the exception

76
00:04:14.729 --> 00:04:17.070
of Eastern Germany, which was the Socialist Unity Party,

77
00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:20.250
but most of them were communist parties. People identified

78
00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:23.480
as communists and the West, we tended to call

79
00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:27.760
them communists because that was a scarier word, but

80
00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:33.100
they themselves admitted that the stage of of of

81
00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:36.790
history that they were in was socialism. And so

82
00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:40.950
they recognized that communism nowhere had been achieved. Communism

83
00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:44.429
was the goal, but socialism was the reality. And

84
00:04:44.429 --> 00:04:48.019
so I wanted to make it very clear, particularly

85
00:04:48.019 --> 00:04:50.600
because this was a historical moment when Bernie Sanders

86
00:04:51.059 --> 00:04:55.130
And this was before Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. This was really

87
00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:59.059
Bernie Sanders' moment, uh, where people understood socialism to

88
00:04:59.059 --> 00:05:02.010
mean Bernie Sanders, which is a very different thing

89
00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:03.660
than what was going on in Eastern Europe at

90
00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:06.380
that time. So state socialism was a term that

91
00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:11.299
I used to name this uh form of socialism

92
00:05:11.299 --> 00:05:14.140
as it existed in Eastern Europe in the 20th

93
00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:14.660
century.

94
00:05:15.989 --> 00:05:21.329
OK. So in the countries where state socialism operated,

95
00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:23.260
what would you say are some of the main

96
00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:26.739
ways in which the lives of women differed from

97
00:05:26.739 --> 00:05:30.130
what we tend to see in capitalist countries?

98
00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:33.059
Right. So, I mean, and there are so many

99
00:05:33.059 --> 00:05:35.125
ways that it's gonna be really hard. To do

100
00:05:35.125 --> 00:05:37.885
this in a short period of time. Because, look,

101
00:05:37.964 --> 00:05:41.204
for the first, in the first case, right? There

102
00:05:41.204 --> 00:05:43.885
was from the very beginning, and we're, we're not

103
00:05:43.885 --> 00:05:46.165
even talking about state socialism in Eastern Europe now.

104
00:05:46.204 --> 00:05:49.404
We're talking about utopian socialism in France in the

105
00:05:49.404 --> 00:05:54.684
late 18th and 19th centuries, where the socialism and

106
00:05:54.684 --> 00:05:58.964
women's emancipation were always connected, going all the way

107
00:05:58.964 --> 00:06:03.649
back to Flora Tristan. And certainly angel and certainly

108
00:06:03.649 --> 00:06:06.910
people like Alexander Colonai and August Bebel in Germany.

109
00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:12.000
Everybody understood that socialism, women's emancipation was a key

110
00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.600
component of socialism. And so what happens in the

111
00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:17.519
Eastern bloc is that from the very get-go, from

112
00:06:17.519 --> 00:06:21.309
the founding, the, the Bolshevik revolution in, in 1917

113
00:06:21.309 --> 00:06:24.519
and on, um, and then the founding of all

114
00:06:24.519 --> 00:06:27.470
of these people's republics after World War II in

115
00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:31.799
the East European states. Everybody understood that women's emancipation

116
00:06:31.799 --> 00:06:33.399
had to be achieved through a certain set of

117
00:06:33.399 --> 00:06:35.959
policies, and what that meant in reality was that

118
00:06:35.959 --> 00:06:39.200
women joined the labor force in much higher numbers

119
00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:41.600
at a much earlier period of time than they

120
00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:44.359
did in the West. It meant that governments invested

121
00:06:44.359 --> 00:06:47.829
very, very heavily in women's professional education and training,

122
00:06:48.279 --> 00:06:52.109
and also made sure that they had employment opportunities,

123
00:06:52.399 --> 00:06:55.359
then at a comparable period of time in the

124
00:06:55.359 --> 00:06:58.790
West. There are so many statistics that I could

125
00:06:58.790 --> 00:07:01.130
show you about, like, for instance, the number of

126
00:07:01.130 --> 00:07:03.309
engineers in the Soviet Union versus the number of

127
00:07:03.309 --> 00:07:05.790
engineers in the United States in like the 70s.

128
00:07:05.950 --> 00:07:08.980
It would be like below 100 compared to like,

129
00:07:09.149 --> 00:07:13.429
thousands um in the Soviet Union. So, that was

130
00:07:13.429 --> 00:07:15.750
the first thing. But then the second thing, and

131
00:07:15.750 --> 00:07:18.920
this is a very important point. Is that they

132
00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:22.549
understood that women had childcare responsibilities, that women had

133
00:07:22.549 --> 00:07:26.839
socially reproductive responsibilities in the home as well as

134
00:07:26.839 --> 00:07:32.480
their primary labor responsibilities in society. And so starting

135
00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:35.839
really in the Soviet Union with Alexandra Kalonai, who

136
00:07:35.839 --> 00:07:38.359
was initially the commissar of social welfare and then

137
00:07:38.359 --> 00:07:40.160
later became the head of the women's section of

138
00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:44.700
the Communist Party, they instituted a series of very

139
00:07:44.700 --> 00:07:49.019
interesting policies. That allowed for the creation of kindergartens

140
00:07:49.019 --> 00:07:52.579
and crushes, that allowed for the socialization of much

141
00:07:52.579 --> 00:07:56.619
housework, that would be public cafeterias, public canteens, public

142
00:07:56.619 --> 00:08:03.809
laundries, massive investments in public transportation. Designing architecture so

143
00:08:03.809 --> 00:08:05.809
that all of the amenities that a woman would

144
00:08:05.809 --> 00:08:07.519
need in order to take care of her home

145
00:08:07.519 --> 00:08:10.130
or within walking distance of her place of residence.

146
00:08:10.570 --> 00:08:13.839
There were a whole series of policies put into

147
00:08:13.839 --> 00:08:17.429
place to support women's roles as both mothers and

148
00:08:17.429 --> 00:08:21.700
workers. In the West, there was nothing. Not only

149
00:08:21.700 --> 00:08:25.100
were women, you know, forced to stay home, they

150
00:08:25.100 --> 00:08:28.980
were economically dependent on their husbands, and they didn't

151
00:08:28.980 --> 00:08:31.299
have any of these amenities or services. I mean,

152
00:08:31.339 --> 00:08:33.690
in the United States, many of our top universities

153
00:08:33.690 --> 00:08:37.440
actually didn't allow women to attend them until very,

154
00:08:37.539 --> 00:08:40.619
very late. So it was only during World War

155
00:08:40.619 --> 00:08:44.638
II. That women were allowed to go into the

156
00:08:44.638 --> 00:08:47.799
labor force because all of the men were fighting

157
00:08:47.799 --> 00:08:49.879
on the front lines. But as soon as the

158
00:08:49.879 --> 00:08:52.508
war was over and the soldiers started coming home

159
00:08:52.508 --> 00:08:55.708
in West European and American in Western European and

160
00:08:55.708 --> 00:08:59.119
North American contexts, women were. Basically shoved back into

161
00:08:59.119 --> 00:09:00.969
the home to take care of the kids and

162
00:09:00.969 --> 00:09:02.809
cook the meals and be surrounded by their fancy

163
00:09:02.809 --> 00:09:05.929
shiny new appliances, whereas in the Soviet Union and

164
00:09:05.929 --> 00:09:09.570
in the Eastern bloc countries, women became full members

165
00:09:09.570 --> 00:09:11.929
of society in the Soviet Union. Many women fought

166
00:09:11.929 --> 00:09:15.250
in the military during the Second World War. So

167
00:09:15.250 --> 00:09:19.289
it was an entirely different conception of gender and

168
00:09:19.289 --> 00:09:22.650
gender roles. And finally, and I think this is

169
00:09:22.650 --> 00:09:26.609
a point that doesn't get discussed often enough, is

170
00:09:26.609 --> 00:09:30.890
that in these countries, women usually had lower retirement

171
00:09:30.890 --> 00:09:34.289
ages. So in a country like Bulgaria, women, if

172
00:09:34.289 --> 00:09:37.119
you had 2 or more children, you retired at

173
00:09:37.119 --> 00:09:40.849
50. Most women, if you had, you know, 1

174
00:09:40.849 --> 00:09:45.075
child or 0, you retired. 55, whereas men usually

175
00:09:45.075 --> 00:09:48.034
retired at 60. So, there was also a way

176
00:09:48.034 --> 00:09:52.224
in which women's labor in the home was recognized

177
00:09:52.224 --> 00:09:57.184
as labor, and it was compensated directly in, um,

178
00:09:57.275 --> 00:10:00.275
monetary terms, but more importantly, through these sort of

179
00:10:00.275 --> 00:10:03.424
transfers of all of these extra amenities in society

180
00:10:03.994 --> 00:10:07.875
that supported women and also with a lower retirement

181
00:10:07.875 --> 00:10:08.315
age.

182
00:10:09.789 --> 00:10:13.739
OK, but of course, these countries were not perfect

183
00:10:14.109 --> 00:10:17.210
when it came to women and how they how

184
00:10:17.210 --> 00:10:19.789
they dealt with women, they failed women in different

185
00:10:19.789 --> 00:10:23.739
ways. I mean, just to mention a few examples,

186
00:10:24.179 --> 00:10:28.030
they failed to include the concern for same-sex couples.

187
00:10:28.150 --> 00:10:31.320
Abortion served as a primary form of birth control

188
00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:34.260
in certain countries, at least where it was available.

189
00:10:34.750 --> 00:10:38.489
Uh, MEN, even though they tried to be involved

190
00:10:38.489 --> 00:10:43.229
in things like housework and childcare, uh, they resisted

191
00:10:43.229 --> 00:10:46.369
challenges to traditional gender roles and stuff like that.

192
00:10:46.460 --> 00:10:49.450
So, could you tell us about those examples and

193
00:10:49.450 --> 00:10:53.159
perhaps give us other examples of ways by which

194
00:10:53.409 --> 00:10:56.760
even state socialist countries failed women?

195
00:10:57.219 --> 00:10:59.049
Sure, yeah, I mean, so the one thing that's

196
00:10:59.049 --> 00:11:01.229
very clear in the book, and I've actually been

197
00:11:01.229 --> 00:11:03.830
criticized for this, is that I don't say that

198
00:11:03.830 --> 00:11:06.229
this was a paradise, right? That, that, in fact,

199
00:11:06.270 --> 00:11:10.309
there were these negative aspects. And um the big

200
00:11:10.309 --> 00:11:13.030
ones, of course, are societal wide, right? You had

201
00:11:13.030 --> 00:11:16.030
consumer shortages, you had travel restrictions, you had the

202
00:11:16.030 --> 00:11:18.950
secret police, you had, there were aspects of the

203
00:11:18.950 --> 00:11:23.109
society that were less than desirable. So, some people

204
00:11:23.109 --> 00:11:25.109
have said, oh well, it doesn't matter if women

205
00:11:25.109 --> 00:11:28.059
were happier, like it was an unfree society. So

206
00:11:28.059 --> 00:11:31.289
that's it the the whole argument is um not

207
00:11:31.289 --> 00:11:34.640
worth having. I think it is worth having because

208
00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:38.239
it's a perfect controlled experiment to show how women's

209
00:11:38.239 --> 00:11:41.239
lives are different between different economic systems, and that's

210
00:11:41.239 --> 00:11:43.000
why I think it's worth going into the data

211
00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:46.309
and actually looking at this example. That being said,

212
00:11:46.599 --> 00:11:50.799
there are some definite downsides. Um, I would say

213
00:11:50.809 --> 00:11:53.909
that, so in not in not in all countries

214
00:11:53.909 --> 00:11:57.630
was abortion available. Uh, IN the Soviet Union during

215
00:11:57.630 --> 00:12:00.080
the, the Stalin period, it was outlawed. It had

216
00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:02.489
been very liberal from 1920. In fact, the Soviet

217
00:12:02.489 --> 00:12:04.159
Union was the first country in the world to

218
00:12:04.159 --> 00:12:07.669
guarantee a woman, uh, first trimester abortion on demand.

219
00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:10.559
It was outlawed in 1936, and then as soon

220
00:12:10.559 --> 00:12:13.500
as Stalin died, it was made legal again. In

221
00:12:13.500 --> 00:12:17.359
Romania, you had abortion until 1966, and then with

222
00:12:17.359 --> 00:12:22.159
Ceausescu's concern about population decline, it was very strictly.

223
00:12:22.789 --> 00:12:27.070
Women's, um, he basically nationalized women's uteruses, and in

224
00:12:27.070 --> 00:12:30.130
Albania you also had a very strict anti-abortion regime,

225
00:12:30.169 --> 00:12:33.919
but in all the other countries, there it was

226
00:12:33.919 --> 00:12:37.640
freely available to a greater or lesser extent. And

227
00:12:37.640 --> 00:12:40.239
um and it is true that it particularly in

228
00:12:40.239 --> 00:12:43.400
the Soviet Union, many women used it as a

229
00:12:43.400 --> 00:12:46.000
form of birth control. Abortion became a very, very

230
00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:49.070
common thing. That was not true in all countries.

231
00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:54.309
Um, EASTERN Germany had hormonal birth control widely available,

232
00:12:54.679 --> 00:12:58.919
and they, um they tried. I've read articles from

233
00:12:58.919 --> 00:13:01.479
the 80s of the East Germans trying to convince

234
00:13:01.479 --> 00:13:04.640
Soviet women to use hormonal birth control. But Soviet

235
00:13:04.640 --> 00:13:07.770
women rejected. They didn't want to use hormonal birth

236
00:13:07.770 --> 00:13:11.119
control when abortion was so easily available. So some

237
00:13:11.119 --> 00:13:14.859
of this is, um, driven by the women themselves.

238
00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:17.799
So if women are choosing to have abortions, that's

239
00:13:17.799 --> 00:13:20.239
a good thing that they're available to them, you

240
00:13:20.239 --> 00:13:23.599
know, that's not a bad thing. Um, AND it's

241
00:13:23.599 --> 00:13:26.320
the irony, of course, is that in, in communist

242
00:13:26.320 --> 00:13:30.520
Poland, women had free, safe access to abortion, and

243
00:13:30.520 --> 00:13:32.640
then as soon as they became a democracy, they

244
00:13:32.640 --> 00:13:37.510
lost that. Um, Sweden got abortion because so many

245
00:13:37.510 --> 00:13:41.140
Swedish women were going to Poland during communism to

246
00:13:41.140 --> 00:13:43.739
get abortions, and basically the Swedish government said this

247
00:13:43.739 --> 00:13:46.059
is really embarrassing that our women have to go

248
00:13:46.059 --> 00:13:48.820
to a communist country to deal with their reproductive

249
00:13:48.820 --> 00:13:52.710
rights, we should liberalize abortion. So, So again, I,

250
00:13:52.789 --> 00:13:55.059
I realized that abortion is a very tricky topic,

251
00:13:55.109 --> 00:13:57.789
but if you believe in the right of women's

252
00:13:57.789 --> 00:14:00.869
bodily autonomy, it is true that these East European

253
00:14:00.869 --> 00:14:03.909
countries were the first to guarantee it, and they

254
00:14:03.909 --> 00:14:06.950
tried to make it available to people when it

255
00:14:06.950 --> 00:14:10.320
was necessary. Um, THAT doesn't mean that it was

256
00:14:10.320 --> 00:14:13.840
ideal or it was perfect. Um, AND yes, it

257
00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:16.000
would have been better perhaps if more women had

258
00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.080
used hormonal birth control in the Soviet Union, but

259
00:14:18.080 --> 00:14:20.520
it was their choice, and I think that's something

260
00:14:20.520 --> 00:14:23.869
that needs to be taken into account. What were

261
00:14:23.869 --> 00:14:26.469
the other things? I mean, so there was gender

262
00:14:26.469 --> 00:14:29.070
segregation in the labor force. That was a big

263
00:14:29.070 --> 00:14:34.940
problem, um, in terms of women were generally relegated

264
00:14:34.940 --> 00:14:37.750
to what we would think of as more feminized

265
00:14:37.750 --> 00:14:40.989
sectors of the economy, things like textiles and food

266
00:14:40.989 --> 00:14:45.219
processing, a lot of services. On the other hand,

267
00:14:45.960 --> 00:14:48.559
They were also relegated to things that the communists

268
00:14:48.559 --> 00:14:51.760
didn't value because they weren't manual labor, so they,

269
00:14:51.880 --> 00:14:56.880
they dominated medicine, doctors, nurses, um, they dominated law,

270
00:14:57.039 --> 00:15:00.200
so lawyers and judges were primarily women. They dominated

271
00:15:00.200 --> 00:15:03.750
finance, banking, and Um, you know, sort of, so,

272
00:15:03.869 --> 00:15:05.830
so lots of things that we would consider sort

273
00:15:05.830 --> 00:15:08.780
of high status white collar professions in the West

274
00:15:08.989 --> 00:15:11.940
were dominated by women in the east because real

275
00:15:11.940 --> 00:15:16.030
men did manual labor. Um, AND so it's really

276
00:15:16.030 --> 00:15:18.830
hard to compare east and west. And the other

277
00:15:18.830 --> 00:15:21.929
thing is, as I said, there were these labor

278
00:15:21.929 --> 00:15:25.380
men did generally, there was a wage gap. And

279
00:15:25.380 --> 00:15:27.739
when we think of that in Western terms, we

280
00:15:27.739 --> 00:15:29.739
think, oh well, women got paid less than men

281
00:15:29.739 --> 00:15:34.070
did. But it's complicated in the east because everybody's

282
00:15:34.070 --> 00:15:37.669
employer was the government, and women were receiving a

283
00:15:37.669 --> 00:15:41.820
lot of in-kind contributions that men did not receive.

284
00:15:42.229 --> 00:15:46.099
And so if you actually include those in-kind contributions,

285
00:15:46.270 --> 00:15:50.960
as well as, for instance, lower retirement ages, in

286
00:15:50.960 --> 00:15:54.280
some ways, women were actually paid more than men,

287
00:15:54.510 --> 00:15:57.190
and they were certainly compensated in a way that

288
00:15:57.190 --> 00:16:00.710
made them very independent so that If they got

289
00:16:00.710 --> 00:16:02.890
a divorce or if they were in an unhappy

290
00:16:02.890 --> 00:16:06.760
or abusive or otherwise unsatisfying relationship, they could very

291
00:16:06.760 --> 00:16:12.070
easily leave. So some people would say, Socialism was

292
00:16:12.070 --> 00:16:15.429
bad because the divorce rate was high, right? Women

293
00:16:15.429 --> 00:16:19.270
tended to initiate divorce at a much greater frequency

294
00:16:19.270 --> 00:16:21.710
than they did in the West, particularly during this

295
00:16:21.710 --> 00:16:26.570
time. And, um, but they got remarried faster, right?

296
00:16:26.969 --> 00:16:30.140
Because there was less worry about if that relationship

297
00:16:30.140 --> 00:16:32.219
didn't work out, you could just get another divorce.

298
00:16:32.260 --> 00:16:35.429
It wasn't such a big deal. Whereas for women

299
00:16:35.429 --> 00:16:40.210
in the West, divorce was absolutely devastating financially and

300
00:16:40.210 --> 00:16:42.539
economically, and many women were trapped in unhappy and

301
00:16:42.539 --> 00:16:47.119
abusive or unsatisfying relationships for that reason. So, yeah,

302
00:16:47.280 --> 00:16:50.549
and then finally, I would say that women were

303
00:16:51.280 --> 00:16:56.159
required to work. And um when we have looked

304
00:16:56.159 --> 00:16:59.440
at surveys, and there a lot of surveys were

305
00:16:59.440 --> 00:17:02.559
done for women in the um different Eastern bloc

306
00:17:02.559 --> 00:17:08.388
countries. When women were asked, Even in the 50s,

307
00:17:08.628 --> 00:17:10.708
only 2 or 3% of them said they would

308
00:17:10.708 --> 00:17:14.430
prefer to stay home. So, even though they were

309
00:17:14.430 --> 00:17:17.630
compelled to work, and they were, you didn't really

310
00:17:17.630 --> 00:17:19.189
have a choice to just stay home and be

311
00:17:19.189 --> 00:17:22.348
a housewife, not a lot of people actually wanted

312
00:17:22.348 --> 00:17:25.348
that. So I think that, again, for the West,

313
00:17:25.430 --> 00:17:27.310
we often criticize the east and saying, well, women

314
00:17:27.310 --> 00:17:29.020
didn't have a choice, they were forced to work.

315
00:17:29.670 --> 00:17:31.859
It is true. They were, everybody was forced to.

316
00:17:32.020 --> 00:17:35.290
Everybody was supposed to contribute to the society. Um,

317
00:17:35.300 --> 00:17:37.900
BUT you were also guaranteed a job and you

318
00:17:37.900 --> 00:17:42.170
couldn't get fired. So, you know, there's a, again,

319
00:17:42.300 --> 00:17:44.660
you have to understand, first of all, two things.

320
00:17:44.739 --> 00:17:47.380
One, it's a totally different economic system, so you

321
00:17:47.380 --> 00:17:50.420
can't use capitalist criteria to measure what's going on

322
00:17:50.420 --> 00:17:53.660
over there. And secondly, and this was, I want

323
00:17:53.660 --> 00:17:58.680
to say about same-sex couples. Yes, if you compare

324
00:17:58.680 --> 00:18:00.800
what was happening in the 50s and 60s and

325
00:18:00.800 --> 00:18:03.160
70s in Eastern Europe to what's happening in Europe

326
00:18:03.160 --> 00:18:08.469
in 2025, of course, they were retrograde and horrible.

327
00:18:08.640 --> 00:18:11.189
But let's compare what was happening in the West

328
00:18:11.189 --> 00:18:13.520
in the 40s and 950s, and 60s and 970s

329
00:18:13.520 --> 00:18:15.839
to what was happening there. And in fact, in

330
00:18:15.839 --> 00:18:19.589
places like eastern Germany. They were much more tolerant

331
00:18:19.859 --> 00:18:22.500
of same-sex couples. In Poland, I have colleagues who

332
00:18:22.500 --> 00:18:25.969
do research on this in, in Hungary, in Czechoslovakia.

333
00:18:26.099 --> 00:18:30.739
They were much more open-minded to the idea of

334
00:18:30.739 --> 00:18:33.020
same-sex couples than people in the West. It took

335
00:18:33.020 --> 00:18:36.459
us a lot longer to get there, and that

336
00:18:36.459 --> 00:18:38.699
is well documented. I can give you all sorts

337
00:18:38.699 --> 00:18:42.800
of sources. So again, don't compare present day. With

338
00:18:42.800 --> 00:18:46.000
the past, cause that's not fair, that's anachronism. And

339
00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:48.839
also, try to understand that the criteria that we

340
00:18:48.839 --> 00:18:51.160
use to measure women's success in the West is

341
00:18:51.160 --> 00:18:53.880
going to look very different than what we're talking

342
00:18:53.880 --> 00:18:56.959
about in the East. Finally, and I think this

343
00:18:56.959 --> 00:19:01.520
is a very important point. At no point in

344
00:19:01.520 --> 00:19:04.800
any country that I'm aware of, did they seriously

345
00:19:04.800 --> 00:19:08.880
challenge traditional gender roles. This was a very binary

346
00:19:08.880 --> 00:19:13.130
society. Men were men and women were women. And

347
00:19:13.130 --> 00:19:15.930
when they tried to get men to do, for

348
00:19:15.930 --> 00:19:18.489
instance, housework, or when they tried to get men

349
00:19:18.489 --> 00:19:20.489
to help out around the kitchen, you know, the

350
00:19:20.489 --> 00:19:24.010
kitchen or to do something. Their strategy was to

351
00:19:24.010 --> 00:19:28.040
try to make it a masculine task, right? So,

352
00:19:28.369 --> 00:19:29.969
so, like, for instance, I can give you a

353
00:19:29.969 --> 00:19:32.930
very concrete example of this. So, you know how,

354
00:19:32.969 --> 00:19:34.890
I mean, this is true in most of the

355
00:19:34.890 --> 00:19:36.810
countries that I've been in, is that women tend

356
00:19:36.810 --> 00:19:38.770
to cook in the kitchen, but if there's meat

357
00:19:38.770 --> 00:19:41.290
on a grill outside, it's a man's job to

358
00:19:41.290 --> 00:19:43.650
cook the meat, right? With the fire. Is it

359
00:19:43.650 --> 00:19:44.369
true in Spain?

360
00:19:45.119 --> 00:19:48.790
Uh, IN Portugal, but yes, it's true, yeah.

361
00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:51.199
Yeah, OK, I mean, in, in, in the Iberian

362
00:19:51.199 --> 00:19:54.160
Peninsula, more broadly speaking, right? Like, is it, it's,

363
00:19:54.199 --> 00:19:56.880
it's the case that men grill, right? Why is

364
00:19:56.880 --> 00:19:58.859
that the case? That women do all the other

365
00:19:58.859 --> 00:20:00.760
cooking, but when it comes to like meat and

366
00:20:00.760 --> 00:20:04.119
fire, men do it. So the Bulgarian Women's Committee,

367
00:20:04.160 --> 00:20:08.199
we're like, hmm, that's really interesting because men don't

368
00:20:08.199 --> 00:20:11.390
feel like their masculinity is challenged when they grill.

369
00:20:12.160 --> 00:20:14.890
So are there other things that we can do

370
00:20:15.060 --> 00:20:17.540
to convince men that they can help around the

371
00:20:17.540 --> 00:20:21.290
house? And in Bulgaria, it's very common to drink

372
00:20:21.290 --> 00:20:24.219
um akka, which is this sort of like grappa-like

373
00:20:24.219 --> 00:20:28.880
spirit with salad. And so, when you, when you

374
00:20:28.920 --> 00:20:31.400
are drinking akka, you need maize, and so you

375
00:20:31.400 --> 00:20:33.880
would have a salad. And so it's usually the

376
00:20:33.880 --> 00:20:37.119
woman's job to make the salad. But she said,

377
00:20:37.199 --> 00:20:39.280
but it's men who drink, that this was the

378
00:20:39.280 --> 00:20:41.959
president of the Bulgarian Women's Committee. It's men who

379
00:20:41.959 --> 00:20:44.650
drink Rakka, and it's men who eat the salads.

380
00:20:44.760 --> 00:20:46.449
So all we have to do is give them

381
00:20:46.449 --> 00:20:48.680
a big knife and tell them that women just

382
00:20:48.680 --> 00:20:52.109
don't chop the salad appropriately. It's a man's job.

383
00:20:52.810 --> 00:20:56.010
To, to cut the vegetables for the salad with

384
00:20:56.010 --> 00:20:58.729
this really big manly knife. And then like, we'll

385
00:20:58.729 --> 00:21:02.040
have one less task to do, and it worked,

386
00:21:03.250 --> 00:21:07.369
right? They convinced men to, to chop more vegetables

387
00:21:07.369 --> 00:21:08.890
because if they have the right knife, it was

388
00:21:08.890 --> 00:21:10.609
a very manly thing to do. So what I'm

389
00:21:10.609 --> 00:21:14.609
saying is, in these countries, they used the gender

390
00:21:14.609 --> 00:21:18.050
binary in a way that's very different. Like, we're

391
00:21:18.050 --> 00:21:20.640
in the west very critical of this gender binary.

392
00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:23.609
But in the east, they accepted the gender binary,

393
00:21:23.729 --> 00:21:25.729
and they used it to say, yes, men and

394
00:21:25.729 --> 00:21:29.040
women are different, but their contributions to society are

395
00:21:29.040 --> 00:21:30.209
equally valuable.

396
00:21:32.079 --> 00:21:36.640
So, with the end of the Soviet Union in

397
00:21:36.640 --> 00:21:40.410
the 90s, particularly, what were the main social and

398
00:21:40.410 --> 00:21:44.699
economic changes that occurred with the transition to capitalism?

399
00:21:46.869 --> 00:21:49.510
The whole society fell apart in a very short

400
00:21:49.510 --> 00:21:53.579
period of time. And that means that everything that

401
00:21:53.579 --> 00:21:58.489
had once been state-owned, the state-owned enterprises, were suddenly

402
00:21:58.489 --> 00:22:03.300
either privatized officially, sold to foreign investors, or sold

403
00:22:03.300 --> 00:22:08.839
through voucher privatization to the population. Um, BUT mostly

404
00:22:08.839 --> 00:22:12.270
they were just sold to oligarchs, uh, to insiders

405
00:22:12.560 --> 00:22:15.560
who basically kind of privatized the state. In eastern

406
00:22:15.560 --> 00:22:17.359
Germany is a great case of this, where a

407
00:22:17.359 --> 00:22:19.920
lot of West German investors came in, they basically

408
00:22:19.920 --> 00:22:22.359
destroyed the East German industrial base in a very

409
00:22:22.359 --> 00:22:27.000
short period of time. Germany had massive levels of

410
00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:30.439
unemployment, East Germany, because of the closing of this

411
00:22:30.439 --> 00:22:32.640
industry. And so, the way that this impacted women

412
00:22:32.640 --> 00:22:39.189
is Very specifically. Massive unemployment was a problem for

413
00:22:39.189 --> 00:22:42.510
these new governments, and so they wanted to try

414
00:22:42.510 --> 00:22:47.790
to convince women to not seek re-employment, to just

415
00:22:47.790 --> 00:22:50.550
stay home. And so a lot of women were

416
00:22:50.550 --> 00:22:52.979
basically convinced that aren't you happy now you get

417
00:22:52.979 --> 00:22:54.430
to stay home and be with your kids and

418
00:22:54.430 --> 00:22:59.069
be housewives. In fact, women were very unhappy, and

419
00:22:59.069 --> 00:23:01.469
what you see in all of eastern Germany is

420
00:23:01.469 --> 00:23:06.780
a massive. Birth strike, decline in fertility because women

421
00:23:06.780 --> 00:23:08.739
are just like, oh my God, having children is

422
00:23:08.739 --> 00:23:12.380
now impossible, because in the privatization process, they've shut

423
00:23:12.380 --> 00:23:14.900
down all the kindergartens and the creches. They've shut

424
00:23:14.900 --> 00:23:18.900
down all the canteens and the cafeterias. There's, it's

425
00:23:18.900 --> 00:23:20.579
going to be impossible for me to raise a

426
00:23:20.579 --> 00:23:22.660
family and try to look for work, so I'm

427
00:23:22.660 --> 00:23:25.420
just not gonna have babies. Right now, Eastern Europe,

428
00:23:25.500 --> 00:23:28.380
even now, 35 years after communism, are the fastest

429
00:23:28.380 --> 00:23:32.199
shrinking countries in the world. So, um, so it

430
00:23:32.199 --> 00:23:35.479
was a complete change in society, in the structure

431
00:23:35.479 --> 00:23:41.239
of society, but it also meant that Everything was

432
00:23:41.239 --> 00:23:44.780
about money. From a society where money didn't really

433
00:23:44.780 --> 00:23:49.349
matter, largely because there was nothing to buy. Right?

434
00:23:49.430 --> 00:23:51.430
I mean, these are these are, these are societies

435
00:23:51.430 --> 00:23:54.510
with very few consumer items. There were, there were

436
00:23:54.510 --> 00:23:56.910
a lot of consumer shortages. So even if you

437
00:23:56.910 --> 00:23:58.750
had a lot of money, there, there wasn't really

438
00:23:58.750 --> 00:24:01.189
a lot to do with it. So people didn't,

439
00:24:01.229 --> 00:24:03.400
and, and if you did go to the store,

440
00:24:03.469 --> 00:24:05.619
you could buy the things that everybody else had.

441
00:24:06.150 --> 00:24:11.579
So you couldn't really use money to Distinguish yourself

442
00:24:11.579 --> 00:24:13.979
from everybody else. That was the first thing. So

443
00:24:13.979 --> 00:24:16.530
as soon as '89 comes, suddenly money can buy

444
00:24:16.530 --> 00:24:19.699
everything and people invest a lot more money in

445
00:24:19.699 --> 00:24:24.329
distinguishing themselves as special and different through material possessions.

446
00:24:24.719 --> 00:24:27.489
What that means for women. Is that at a

447
00:24:27.489 --> 00:24:29.000
moment when women are being pushed out of the

448
00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:31.920
labor force, at the same time that they've lost

449
00:24:31.920 --> 00:24:34.400
all these social supports that allowed them to combine

450
00:24:34.400 --> 00:24:37.160
work and family, it's not only that the birth

451
00:24:37.160 --> 00:24:40.880
rate declines, but it's also that women suddenly look

452
00:24:40.880 --> 00:24:45.150
at men as ATMs. And it means that, you

453
00:24:45.150 --> 00:24:48.030
know, a bano up, right? Like, I'm going to

454
00:24:49.250 --> 00:24:53.699
Instead of becoming a judge on some crappy government

455
00:24:53.699 --> 00:24:57.939
salary, I'm gonna, or going to university, I'm gonna

456
00:24:57.939 --> 00:25:02.209
invest in, you know, breast augmentation or plastic surgery,

457
00:25:02.219 --> 00:25:05.020
or dye my hair blonde, or whatever, and get

458
00:25:05.020 --> 00:25:07.219
myself a nice rich oligarch who's gonna take care

459
00:25:07.219 --> 00:25:08.819
of me for the rest of my life. So

460
00:25:08.819 --> 00:25:13.810
there's a really massive change, sea change in society,

461
00:25:14.060 --> 00:25:16.949
where women go from being relatively autonomous and independent

462
00:25:17.180 --> 00:25:24.630
to being Imagined as, you know, basically just accessories

463
00:25:24.630 --> 00:25:26.280
or arm candy for men.

464
00:25:27.060 --> 00:25:30.530
Mhm. But do you think, uh, I mean, do

465
00:25:30.530 --> 00:25:33.729
you think it's fair at least to some extent

466
00:25:33.729 --> 00:25:37.890
to compare when it comes to work, workforce participation,

467
00:25:37.969 --> 00:25:42.410
the labor market, and uh the economic situation of

468
00:25:42.410 --> 00:25:48.050
women to compare these Eastern European countries when they

469
00:25:48.050 --> 00:25:55.489
were state capitalist with contemporary neo-liberal capitalist countries in

470
00:25:55.489 --> 00:25:58.239
any way. And, and if that comparison is fair.

471
00:25:58.569 --> 00:26:01.060
Uh, HOW does it look like?

472
00:26:02.540 --> 00:26:07.869
I mean, so I think. It's important to understand

473
00:26:08.040 --> 00:26:15.979
that they were those countries were like absolutely. Devastated

474
00:26:15.979 --> 00:26:19.209
by neoliberal ideology in the 90s, right? That's what

475
00:26:19.209 --> 00:26:21.060
they got. They, I mean, I've written about this.

476
00:26:21.140 --> 00:26:22.859
I just had a piece in the on diplomatique

477
00:26:22.859 --> 00:26:26.020
just a couple of months ago about how devastating

478
00:26:26.020 --> 00:26:29.430
the economic recession in Eastern Europe was in the

479
00:26:29.430 --> 00:26:33.500
90s because of these neoliberal policies, because of price

480
00:26:33.500 --> 00:26:36.459
liberalization, because of financialization. I can go into a

481
00:26:36.459 --> 00:26:39.699
lot of details about all the mechanisms about what

482
00:26:39.699 --> 00:26:45.640
happened. But, but, so, so, and from the catastrophe

483
00:26:45.640 --> 00:26:49.880
of neoliberalism is what arise, this oligarchy, what you

484
00:26:49.880 --> 00:26:53.760
call state capitalism, right? It was a reaction to

485
00:26:53.760 --> 00:26:56.890
the utter devastation and chaos of the early 90s,

486
00:26:57.280 --> 00:27:01.229
massive levels of unemployment. So much money bleeding out

487
00:27:01.229 --> 00:27:04.949
of these countries, lots of outmigration, because that's the

488
00:27:04.949 --> 00:27:07.630
other thing is that people just left. They didn't

489
00:27:07.630 --> 00:27:09.550
want anything to do with being there, like, go

490
00:27:09.550 --> 00:27:12.670
to the west, go to wherever you could. So,

491
00:27:12.939 --> 00:27:17.170
so it is, it's this transition period, right, where

492
00:27:17.170 --> 00:27:21.260
I think we can see exactly what happens to

493
00:27:21.260 --> 00:27:25.589
women's rights. In capitalism, right? You go from state

494
00:27:25.589 --> 00:27:30.420
socialism, from labor guarantees, and massive social safety nets

495
00:27:30.790 --> 00:27:36.510
to Total liberated free markets for labor and no

496
00:27:36.510 --> 00:27:41.140
social safety nets, and an economic mentality that is

497
00:27:41.140 --> 00:27:45.890
all about enlightened self-interest, right? WHERE women are making

498
00:27:45.890 --> 00:27:49.885
rational economic decisions. ABOUT their bodies and about their

499
00:27:49.885 --> 00:27:53.724
futures, and it turns out that those rational economic

500
00:27:53.724 --> 00:27:59.324
decisions include not having children and include strategically choosing

501
00:27:59.324 --> 00:28:01.724
your romantic partners on the basis of whether or

502
00:28:01.724 --> 00:28:04.630
not they can pay your rent. And that's what

503
00:28:04.630 --> 00:28:07.540
capitalism does. And so, and I and I and

504
00:28:07.550 --> 00:28:09.140
and I and I and I think it's it

505
00:28:09.150 --> 00:28:10.949
it does it in the west too. I think

506
00:28:10.949 --> 00:28:12.540
it does it in the United States as well.

507
00:28:12.589 --> 00:28:16.880
Look at the The whole trad wife thing, right?

508
00:28:17.010 --> 00:28:18.689
Um, IN the United States is there's a sort

509
00:28:18.689 --> 00:28:21.770
of meme of these women like playing Happy Housemaker

510
00:28:21.770 --> 00:28:24.569
on Instagram or whatever. But the whole idea of

511
00:28:24.569 --> 00:28:26.530
that is, I will just be pretty and stay

512
00:28:26.530 --> 00:28:28.810
at home and bake cookies from scratch, and my

513
00:28:28.810 --> 00:28:30.800
husband will go out and work and support me.

514
00:28:31.089 --> 00:28:34.329
Isn't that a better model than you having to

515
00:28:34.329 --> 00:28:38.530
work yourself? Now, to be fair, labor conditions in

516
00:28:38.530 --> 00:28:42.479
the United States in particular suck. So, I don't

517
00:28:42.479 --> 00:28:45.319
blame people for not wanting to work and trying

518
00:28:45.319 --> 00:28:47.599
to get somebody else to pay their rent. But

519
00:28:47.599 --> 00:28:52.719
that puts that person in an incredibly dependent relationship

520
00:28:52.719 --> 00:28:55.380
with the person who's paying the bills. And that

521
00:28:55.380 --> 00:28:58.239
can have all sorts of downstream effects that they

522
00:28:58.239 --> 00:29:01.199
may not understand when they're not as young and

523
00:29:01.199 --> 00:29:03.199
beautiful as they are right now.

524
00:29:05.199 --> 00:29:07.380
So I, I want to ask you, and also

525
00:29:07.380 --> 00:29:10.140
since you mentioned red wives there, I want to

526
00:29:10.140 --> 00:29:13.989
ask you specifically about motherhood. So how is it

527
00:29:13.989 --> 00:29:19.939
dealt with in neoliberal capitalist countries versus state socialist

528
00:29:19.939 --> 00:29:20.569
countries?

529
00:29:21.020 --> 00:29:22.739
Yeah, so I think that in, in a, in

530
00:29:22.739 --> 00:29:27.260
a neoliberal context, um, especially, you know, today, again,

531
00:29:27.420 --> 00:29:31.099
it's always tricky because we're doing anachronistic comparison. We're

532
00:29:31.099 --> 00:29:34.989
talking about 2024 versus like the 20th century. But

533
00:29:34.989 --> 00:29:38.709
um, but motherhood is a choice, right? I mean,

534
00:29:38.869 --> 00:29:41.589
it it it's, it's something it's a decision that

535
00:29:41.589 --> 00:29:44.310
you make, and it's a decision in a neoliberal

536
00:29:44.310 --> 00:29:48.520
context that many women decide not to make, right?

537
00:29:48.670 --> 00:29:51.000
Which is why it look at Southern Europe, right?

538
00:29:51.430 --> 00:29:56.329
Birth rates are through the floor, um. Everywhere in

539
00:29:56.329 --> 00:29:59.930
the in the industrial, Japan, Korea, right? And even

540
00:29:59.930 --> 00:30:02.810
in the United States, are the birth rate is

541
00:30:02.810 --> 00:30:07.010
declining precipitously, even in China, right? Birth rates are

542
00:30:07.010 --> 00:30:12.670
declining. Why? Because in a neoliberal system, Where money

543
00:30:12.670 --> 00:30:16.819
is everything, and everything has economic value. I'm sorry

544
00:30:16.819 --> 00:30:19.430
to say this, but I am a mother, so

545
00:30:19.430 --> 00:30:22.949
I think I'm allowed. Children have zero economic benefit

546
00:30:22.949 --> 00:30:25.750
to their parents. They're just like, you might as

547
00:30:25.750 --> 00:30:28.069
well just dig a hole in your backyard and

548
00:30:28.069 --> 00:30:30.430
throw all your money, time, and attention into that

549
00:30:30.430 --> 00:30:34.109
hole, because that's what a child is, right? From

550
00:30:34.109 --> 00:30:37.709
an economic point of view, right? And so, of

551
00:30:37.709 --> 00:30:41.939
course, in a neoliberal economy, Nobody's gonna have children,

552
00:30:42.170 --> 00:30:44.250
right? Nobody's gonna want children. And the people that

553
00:30:44.250 --> 00:30:47.280
do have children tend to be people who, um,

554
00:30:47.410 --> 00:30:50.949
can afford them. Like, it's a luxury item. Um,

555
00:30:51.010 --> 00:30:53.890
OR it's because they're poor and for one reason

556
00:30:53.890 --> 00:30:56.250
or the other, you know, there were, um, they

557
00:30:56.250 --> 00:30:58.170
didn't have access to birth control or they didn't

558
00:30:58.170 --> 00:31:01.369
have access to abortion or whatever. So, so I

559
00:31:01.369 --> 00:31:04.489
think, you know, there's also this kind of girl

560
00:31:04.489 --> 00:31:07.449
bossary in, in the west about like, you can

561
00:31:07.449 --> 00:31:09.959
have it all. And so the other man, the

562
00:31:09.959 --> 00:31:13.729
other model is, I will have a baby. But

563
00:31:13.729 --> 00:31:15.569
then I will go to work and I will

564
00:31:15.569 --> 00:31:19.050
pay poorer women to look after my child, right?

565
00:31:19.160 --> 00:31:23.459
I will outsource mothering to poor, more disadvantaged people.

566
00:31:23.540 --> 00:31:26.569
So that's the Western model. In state socialism, it

567
00:31:26.569 --> 00:31:29.849
was a very different conception, right, of what a

568
00:31:29.849 --> 00:31:35.089
child was. So going back to Colina in 1917.

569
00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:39.680
Colin Tide believed very strongly that a child is

570
00:31:39.680 --> 00:31:43.329
not just A gift to the parents, it's a

571
00:31:43.329 --> 00:31:46.719
gift to society, and society has an important role

572
00:31:46.719 --> 00:31:50.619
to play in helping to raise that child. Obviously

573
00:31:50.619 --> 00:31:52.380
the parents are always going to be the parents,

574
00:31:52.459 --> 00:31:55.079
but they need help and they need support. And

575
00:31:55.079 --> 00:31:58.339
in every single state socialist country in Eastern Europe,

576
00:31:58.380 --> 00:32:00.729
and many outside of Eastern Europe, by the way,

577
00:32:01.260 --> 00:32:05.000
support for families was part and parcel of the

578
00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:09.255
economic redistribution of surplus. THAT occurred, right? So one

579
00:32:09.255 --> 00:32:13.055
way you took the profits from these state-owned enterprises

580
00:32:13.055 --> 00:32:15.795
and you reinvested them into society, and that meant

581
00:32:15.795 --> 00:32:19.724
reinvesting in the next generation of workers and consumers

582
00:32:19.724 --> 00:32:24.854
and taxpayers and soldiers and whatever, citizens. So, it

583
00:32:24.854 --> 00:32:28.329
was just a completely different way. Of thinking about

584
00:32:28.329 --> 00:32:33.209
the value of other people's children, basically, every person's

585
00:32:33.209 --> 00:32:37.089
child is contributing to the society that we all

586
00:32:37.089 --> 00:32:39.930
live in. And so, therefore, as a society, we

587
00:32:39.930 --> 00:32:43.689
should help people who are bringing children and raising

588
00:32:43.689 --> 00:32:47.689
children into our society. But we don't think that

589
00:32:47.689 --> 00:32:51.770
way in neoliberalism because it's expensive. It costs a

590
00:32:51.770 --> 00:32:54.574
lot of money to support. Mothers. It costs a

591
00:32:54.574 --> 00:32:57.055
lot of money to support families. We know it's

592
00:32:57.055 --> 00:32:59.055
very good for the kids. We know it's very

593
00:32:59.055 --> 00:33:00.895
good for the mothers. We even know it's very

594
00:33:00.895 --> 00:33:03.454
good for the families, but we don't do it

595
00:33:03.454 --> 00:33:05.415
because it costs a lot of money. And it's

596
00:33:05.415 --> 00:33:08.265
so much easier to have that labor, that essential

597
00:33:08.265 --> 00:33:10.974
labor that we need be done for free by

598
00:33:10.974 --> 00:33:14.255
women in the home, which is why trad wives

599
00:33:14.255 --> 00:33:16.454
are such a big thing right now, because the

600
00:33:16.454 --> 00:33:21.729
United States has a birth, um, decline. And, um,

601
00:33:21.739 --> 00:33:25.180
and they're very nervous about this because a shrinking

602
00:33:25.180 --> 00:33:28.380
population means a shrinking GDP. It means fewer people

603
00:33:28.380 --> 00:33:30.699
to buy the crap that you make, you know,

604
00:33:30.859 --> 00:33:33.369
fewer people to buy a new phone every year.

605
00:33:33.859 --> 00:33:35.819
So that means the economy is gonna shrink. I

606
00:33:35.819 --> 00:33:38.579
mean, China has the same worry. Their, their population

607
00:33:38.579 --> 00:33:42.770
is shrinking. Anybody who has a growth. ORIENTED mindset

608
00:33:42.770 --> 00:33:47.170
is gonna worry about population decline. So European countries

609
00:33:47.170 --> 00:33:49.510
generally try to say, OK, we want women to

610
00:33:49.510 --> 00:33:52.910
work because they're contributing to pension payments and they're

611
00:33:52.910 --> 00:33:55.880
paying taxes, but we also want them To have

612
00:33:55.880 --> 00:33:59.119
babies. So we're gonna build crushes in kindergartens, and

613
00:33:59.119 --> 00:34:02.119
we're gonna do paid job protected maternity leaves. It's

614
00:34:02.119 --> 00:34:05.479
another thing that East European countries were absolutely fantastic

615
00:34:05.479 --> 00:34:08.840
at. One or two years of paid job protective

616
00:34:08.840 --> 00:34:11.560
parental leave, if you had a baby, you could

617
00:34:11.560 --> 00:34:13.120
go back to your job, you could leave your

618
00:34:13.120 --> 00:34:14.918
job and go back to your job with no

619
00:34:14.918 --> 00:34:18.467
problem. So, West European countries have sort of followed

620
00:34:18.467 --> 00:34:21.148
that model. But in the United States, because we

621
00:34:21.148 --> 00:34:23.108
don't want to pay for that, we just say,

622
00:34:23.197 --> 00:34:26.509
oh, let's pretend that it's really sexy and cool

623
00:34:26.509 --> 00:34:29.059
to be a trad wife and stay at home

624
00:34:29.059 --> 00:34:31.768
and make lots of babies and bake cookies. And

625
00:34:31.768 --> 00:34:34.569
I think that that's, that's the model, you know,

626
00:34:34.748 --> 00:34:36.428
is that we want women to just go home

627
00:34:36.428 --> 00:34:38.579
and have lots of babies, which is gonna be

628
00:34:38.579 --> 00:34:40.628
a problem in the long run because there might

629
00:34:40.628 --> 00:34:43.290
be women who go home. And then don't have

630
00:34:43.290 --> 00:34:47.770
babies because they're not stupid. Right? If you're being

631
00:34:47.770 --> 00:34:52.409
paid to be beautiful and serene and happy at

632
00:34:52.409 --> 00:34:56.120
home, children are gonna mess up that look. So,

633
00:34:56.810 --> 00:34:58.770
so I, you know, I just think that it's,

634
00:34:58.780 --> 00:35:03.419
um, but it, it explains why. Explains our falling

635
00:35:03.419 --> 00:35:06.600
birth rates, but it also explains this fascination, I

636
00:35:06.600 --> 00:35:08.050
think, with the trad wife.

637
00:35:08.830 --> 00:35:12.629
Mhm. But I mean, on the other hand, and

638
00:35:12.629 --> 00:35:15.389
still on the topic of motherhood, I think this

639
00:35:15.389 --> 00:35:18.429
is something that you didn't touch on when I

640
00:35:18.429 --> 00:35:21.350
asked you earlier about some of the issues that

641
00:35:21.350 --> 00:35:25.310
we have to deal with in former Eastern European

642
00:35:25.310 --> 00:35:28.949
uh socialist countries. Uh, I mean, is, wasn't it

643
00:35:28.949 --> 00:35:31.419
the case that at least in some of them,

644
00:35:31.629 --> 00:35:35.110
there was lots of pressure for women to have

645
00:35:35.110 --> 00:35:35.580
children?

646
00:35:36.330 --> 00:35:40.330
Absolutely. These were very pro-natalist societies. I mean, but

647
00:35:40.330 --> 00:35:46.050
it, it, the pressure was societal. So, so fertility

648
00:35:46.050 --> 00:35:49.429
rates are, are, are fertility patterns in Eastern Europe

649
00:35:49.429 --> 00:35:51.820
were very different from Western Europe. So in eastern

650
00:35:51.979 --> 00:35:54.860
Europe, it was the case in most countries that

651
00:35:54.860 --> 00:35:56.860
you had your children very young, when you were

652
00:35:56.860 --> 00:36:01.239
21, 22, 23. Sometimes you would be living with

653
00:36:01.239 --> 00:36:03.020
still with your parents while you had your children

654
00:36:03.020 --> 00:36:05.770
so that your mother, the usually the mother's mother,

655
00:36:05.929 --> 00:36:10.649
could help with the children. And then, Um, and

656
00:36:10.649 --> 00:36:12.850
then once the child was old enough to go

657
00:36:12.850 --> 00:36:16.300
to kindergarten, then you would move out and continue

658
00:36:16.300 --> 00:36:18.090
on with your career. So women had children in

659
00:36:18.090 --> 00:36:20.850
their, um, in their early twenties when they were

660
00:36:20.850 --> 00:36:25.560
at university sometimes. The other thing was socialist countries.

661
00:36:26.169 --> 00:36:30.570
Incentivize young child, uh, bearing because if you had

662
00:36:30.570 --> 00:36:32.489
a baby, you were more likely to get an

663
00:36:32.489 --> 00:36:35.929
apartment, right? So, so if you wanted to move

664
00:36:35.929 --> 00:36:38.370
out of your parents' house, that was like the

665
00:36:38.370 --> 00:36:40.050
best thing you could do was get married pretty

666
00:36:40.050 --> 00:36:42.919
young and have a baby. And so, yes, there

667
00:36:42.919 --> 00:36:45.520
was, and, and then, you know, the government gave

668
00:36:45.520 --> 00:36:49.679
you newlywed loans. They, there were these, um, you

669
00:36:49.679 --> 00:36:52.360
know, subsidized mortgages for your apartments in places where

670
00:36:52.360 --> 00:36:55.520
you actually owned your apartment like Bulgaria. The government

671
00:36:55.520 --> 00:36:59.439
would actually give you a mortgage, and it was

672
00:36:59.439 --> 00:37:02.080
a very, like 2% uh interest rate, it was

673
00:37:02.080 --> 00:37:04.070
a very little interest rate, but if you had

674
00:37:04.070 --> 00:37:06.649
one child, then it went to like 1.5%. If

675
00:37:06.649 --> 00:37:09.610
you had two child, two children, Then it went

676
00:37:09.610 --> 00:37:11.489
down to almost nothing, and if you had 3

677
00:37:11.489 --> 00:37:14.209
children, it was gone forever, right? Um, IT was

678
00:37:14.209 --> 00:37:18.169
just forgiven. So there were lots of incentives to

679
00:37:18.169 --> 00:37:22.010
have children, absolutely. And to the extent that there

680
00:37:22.010 --> 00:37:27.399
was pressure, It was from the state, yes, but

681
00:37:27.399 --> 00:37:30.399
it was also from people's parents, which is not

682
00:37:30.399 --> 00:37:34.560
different than the West, right? So, so there's a

683
00:37:34.560 --> 00:37:36.600
lot of pressure in the west for for people

684
00:37:36.600 --> 00:37:38.750
to have children as well. It's just that it

685
00:37:38.750 --> 00:37:41.989
wasn't as coercive, but in no country other than

686
00:37:42.320 --> 00:37:49.110
Romania. And perhaps Albania and um The Soviet Union

687
00:37:49.110 --> 00:37:53.620
during those Stalin years, were women prevented from having

688
00:37:54.709 --> 00:37:58.629
access to either pretty reliable birth control or abortion

689
00:37:58.629 --> 00:38:02.669
on demand. And so even though these countries put

690
00:38:02.669 --> 00:38:05.780
a lot of pressure on women to have children,

691
00:38:05.870 --> 00:38:10.629
absolutely, they created a massive social safety net in

692
00:38:10.629 --> 00:38:12.550
order to so that the state could help raise

693
00:38:12.550 --> 00:38:17.370
those children. And B, they allowed women the technology

694
00:38:17.379 --> 00:38:20.100
not to get pregnant in the first place, and

695
00:38:20.100 --> 00:38:22.300
then even if they did get pregnant, again, with

696
00:38:22.300 --> 00:38:24.580
the exception of Romania and Albania and the Soviet

697
00:38:24.580 --> 00:38:27.750
Union between 36 and 55. You could have an

698
00:38:27.750 --> 00:38:32.270
abortion. That's not true of Poland today, right? That's

699
00:38:32.270 --> 00:38:33.550
not true in a lot of states in the

700
00:38:33.550 --> 00:38:38.260
United States today. So, Yes, you're absolutely right. There

701
00:38:38.260 --> 00:38:40.469
was a lot of social pressure to have children,

702
00:38:40.679 --> 00:38:43.000
but there was also the availability of birth control

703
00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:45.120
and abortion. So I don't know how you square

704
00:38:45.120 --> 00:38:48.699
those two things. It was a totalitarian society. I

705
00:38:48.699 --> 00:38:51.750
am not denying that it was a totalitarian society,

706
00:38:51.979 --> 00:38:55.679
but there were authoritarian structures in place. That being

707
00:38:55.679 --> 00:38:59.370
said, I think for the years that those countries

708
00:38:59.370 --> 00:39:03.889
existed, If you looked at comparable situation of women

709
00:39:03.889 --> 00:39:06.610
in countries in the west, women in the eastern

710
00:39:06.610 --> 00:39:09.969
bloc had it way better, and western women at

711
00:39:09.969 --> 00:39:11.689
the time knew it.

712
00:39:12.810 --> 00:39:15.530
Mhm. So I would, I would like to ask

713
00:39:15.530 --> 00:39:18.510
you now about uh the presence of women in

714
00:39:18.510 --> 00:39:21.969
leadership positions and roles. I mean, uh, and before

715
00:39:21.969 --> 00:39:25.889
I ask you about how does it compare between

716
00:39:25.889 --> 00:39:29.290
capitalist and socialist countries, uh, I would like to

717
00:39:29.290 --> 00:39:33.780
ask. Why is the presence of women in leadership

718
00:39:33.780 --> 00:39:38.020
positions important? I mean, why is it an important

719
00:39:38.020 --> 00:39:41.060
indicator to look into when it comes to talking

720
00:39:41.060 --> 00:39:45.340
about women's rights and equality between the sexes?

721
00:39:47.370 --> 00:39:49.679
So here I'm gonna say something perhaps a little

722
00:39:49.679 --> 00:39:52.469
controversial, which is that I don't think it's that

723
00:39:52.469 --> 00:39:56.530
important. Um, AND, and, and, and here's why, because

724
00:39:56.530 --> 00:40:00.370
Margaret Thatcher didn't really help women. She happened to

725
00:40:00.370 --> 00:40:03.800
be a woman, you know, but she was not

726
00:40:03.889 --> 00:40:07.689
a particularly woman friendly woman, right? Um, I can

727
00:40:07.689 --> 00:40:11.159
think of plenty of examples of women, for instance,

728
00:40:11.209 --> 00:40:14.250
that are being put into the second Trump administration

729
00:40:14.250 --> 00:40:18.620
cabinet who are not. Gonna do anything good for

730
00:40:18.620 --> 00:40:22.260
women in this country, right? So, this idea that

731
00:40:22.260 --> 00:40:25.300
somehow if you put women in power, it's going

732
00:40:25.300 --> 00:40:27.659
to be better for women's rights or is a

733
00:40:27.659 --> 00:40:32.989
very western neoliberal ideology. It's like, I, I feel

734
00:40:32.989 --> 00:40:35.790
very strongly about this because I think it's just

735
00:40:35.790 --> 00:40:39.909
wrongheaded to say, oh, well, you know, we had

736
00:40:39.909 --> 00:40:42.629
a woman vice president, so therefore, there's no sexism

737
00:40:42.629 --> 00:40:45.820
in our country. That's just absurd, right? There aren't

738
00:40:45.820 --> 00:40:50.389
policies, structural policies that disadvantaged women, um, because we

739
00:40:50.389 --> 00:40:52.429
have women in high positions of power, or we

740
00:40:52.429 --> 00:40:55.070
have a woman CEO and so therefore, like, the

741
00:40:55.070 --> 00:40:57.790
business world is friendly to women. That's just not

742
00:40:57.790 --> 00:41:02.260
true. It's patently false. So, so, so the premise

743
00:41:02.639 --> 00:41:06.080
here is that in theory, right, if you have

744
00:41:06.080 --> 00:41:09.489
women in power, Um, first of all, they serve

745
00:41:09.489 --> 00:41:12.610
as role role models for younger women. I think

746
00:41:12.610 --> 00:41:15.110
there's something to that. Uh, WHEN we look at,

747
00:41:15.120 --> 00:41:20.030
for instance, math scores. There's a this PISA exam

748
00:41:20.030 --> 00:41:22.639
that is done across the world, particularly in Europe

749
00:41:22.639 --> 00:41:25.290
and the European Union, to gauge the, you know,

750
00:41:25.560 --> 00:41:28.679
level of preparedness in certain topics. And we can

751
00:41:28.679 --> 00:41:32.560
see there was a wonderful paper in 2018 called

752
00:41:32.560 --> 00:41:36.280
Girls Math and Socialism, which shows that girls, there's

753
00:41:36.280 --> 00:41:38.560
a less of a gender gap in former communist

754
00:41:38.560 --> 00:41:41.280
countries in math scores than there are in Western

755
00:41:41.280 --> 00:41:43.739
countries. And a lot of the reason for that

756
00:41:43.739 --> 00:41:46.260
is because there were a lot more women mathematicians

757
00:41:46.260 --> 00:41:48.979
and a lot more women teachers in math, especially

758
00:41:48.979 --> 00:41:51.939
high level math. And um and so I do

759
00:41:51.939 --> 00:41:54.280
think that the role model effect at a more

760
00:41:54.280 --> 00:41:57.179
local level is important to girls. I'm not saying

761
00:41:57.179 --> 00:41:59.919
that that's not important. I do think that there's

762
00:41:59.919 --> 00:42:03.040
something really important when you see a a a

763
00:42:03.040 --> 00:42:05.760
person in a position of power that it's not

764
00:42:05.760 --> 00:42:09.929
always a white man. But that being said, right,

765
00:42:10.419 --> 00:42:14.199
if you take the 1% of our society, the

766
00:42:14.199 --> 00:42:18.419
economic elites, and your goal for greater equality in

767
00:42:18.419 --> 00:42:22.379
your society is to make sure that everybody in

768
00:42:22.379 --> 00:42:27.260
that 1% represents, you know, evenly different genders or

769
00:42:27.260 --> 00:42:32.179
different ethnicities or religions or sexualities or whatever, you're

770
00:42:32.179 --> 00:42:35.050
not dealing with the problem that that's only 1%.

771
00:42:35.540 --> 00:42:38.760
Right? There's 99% of the pyramid that is still

772
00:42:38.760 --> 00:42:43.959
screwed, right? So to me, that's a distraction. Talking

773
00:42:43.959 --> 00:42:46.239
about, you know, women in positions of power. Oh,

774
00:42:46.320 --> 00:42:48.790
well, women weren't the heads of hospitals or women

775
00:42:48.790 --> 00:42:52.719
aren't the heads of universities. I mean, really, you

776
00:42:52.719 --> 00:42:55.040
know, why are we worried about the elites when

777
00:42:55.040 --> 00:42:57.520
we should be worried about society as a whole.

778
00:42:57.560 --> 00:43:00.659
So, So, so, yeah. So I think that there's

779
00:43:00.659 --> 00:43:04.060
a, you know, back in the 70s and 80s,

780
00:43:04.110 --> 00:43:06.770
there was a fair amount of research, for instance,

781
00:43:06.979 --> 00:43:10.979
um particularly around things like the Grameen Bank, right?

782
00:43:11.020 --> 00:43:13.580
Which is when you, if you gave loans to

783
00:43:13.580 --> 00:43:17.290
women, that the, the money was better used than

784
00:43:17.290 --> 00:43:19.060
if you gave it to men, right? That women

785
00:43:19.060 --> 00:43:22.100
tend to spend more on their families, um, men

786
00:43:22.100 --> 00:43:24.800
tend to go out and drink. So, so there

787
00:43:24.800 --> 00:43:28.379
is, there are structural things that have to do

788
00:43:28.379 --> 00:43:30.669
with gender that I don't think we should ignore,

789
00:43:30.919 --> 00:43:36.090
but I don't think, you know, Putting a woman,

790
00:43:36.209 --> 00:43:39.969
I mean, like, um, uh, Marine Le Pen is

791
00:43:39.969 --> 00:43:43.929
gonna do any favors for us, right? Like, that's

792
00:43:43.929 --> 00:43:46.370
just a bizarre, like, oh, the West is so

793
00:43:46.370 --> 00:43:50.850
enlightened because, you know, she's the president of France.

794
00:43:50.969 --> 00:43:54.500
Really? You know, or um in Germany, the the

795
00:43:54.500 --> 00:43:56.729
there's a woman, uh, I can't remember her name

796
00:43:56.729 --> 00:43:58.169
right off the top of my head, who's the

797
00:43:58.169 --> 00:44:01.320
head of the Alternative for Deutschland party. Right? Or

798
00:44:01.320 --> 00:44:04.709
she's a very prominent politician in that party. Like,

799
00:44:05.239 --> 00:44:08.320
you're missing the forest for the trees if you

800
00:44:08.320 --> 00:44:10.260
think that just because there's a woman in charge,

801
00:44:10.320 --> 00:44:14.159
that somehow that's a progressive sign of anything.

802
00:44:15.050 --> 00:44:18.300
OK, I, I get your point, but since people

803
00:44:18.300 --> 00:44:22.459
still take that seriously, do we have good enough

804
00:44:22.459 --> 00:44:26.020
data when it comes to, uh, to what extent

805
00:44:26.020 --> 00:44:32.250
women occupied leadership positions in former uh socialist countries?

806
00:44:32.389 --> 00:44:36.219
Yes, we do. And, and it's um high representation

807
00:44:36.219 --> 00:44:39.300
of women at the local and municipal and oblast

808
00:44:39.300 --> 00:44:43.074
level, and Uh, and less participation, the higher you

809
00:44:43.074 --> 00:44:45.514
go up into the Communist Party. So with the

810
00:44:45.514 --> 00:44:50.915
exception of a few countries, Politburo members generally tended

811
00:44:50.915 --> 00:44:53.034
to be men. That was not true in Bulgaria.

812
00:44:53.074 --> 00:44:57.104
There was a long standing woman Politburo member, Soloraoyeva.

813
00:44:57.435 --> 00:44:59.955
Uh, IN the Soviet Union, um, there were a

814
00:44:59.955 --> 00:45:03.879
few women that were on the Politburo. The central

815
00:45:03.879 --> 00:45:07.500
committees tended to have a fair representation of women,

816
00:45:07.830 --> 00:45:11.100
sometimes under quota systems because they believed in women's

817
00:45:11.100 --> 00:45:13.629
emancipation, but they didn't, I mean, they didn't really

818
00:45:13.629 --> 00:45:17.270
have power, right? A lot of the, because the

819
00:45:17.270 --> 00:45:21.840
power was so concentrated in these socialist countries. Um,

820
00:45:21.949 --> 00:45:24.550
IT'S, you know, it's kind of a show, but

821
00:45:24.550 --> 00:45:27.270
it is in fact true that there were fewer

822
00:45:27.270 --> 00:45:30.310
women in very, very high positions of power throughout

823
00:45:30.310 --> 00:45:33.310
the eastern bloc countries, and where they were in

824
00:45:33.310 --> 00:45:38.370
power. They weren't always nice, right? So, again, this

825
00:45:38.370 --> 00:45:41.159
is the problem, right? It's a, you know, um,

826
00:45:41.729 --> 00:45:44.169
I don't think it's a, it's a good system.

827
00:45:44.689 --> 00:45:47.129
But, but, uh, but your point is a better

828
00:45:47.129 --> 00:45:49.320
point, uh, that I want to address, which is,

829
00:45:49.449 --> 00:45:52.270
so let's not talk about politics. Let's talk about

830
00:45:52.270 --> 00:45:56.770
uh economics. So enterprise directors would, right? Like, so

831
00:45:56.770 --> 00:46:00.129
you would have a hospital and all of the

832
00:46:00.129 --> 00:46:02.530
doctors and surgeons would be women, but the hospital

833
00:46:02.530 --> 00:46:05.570
director, the administrator would be a man. Or you

834
00:46:05.570 --> 00:46:08.310
would have like, um, I read a great dissertation

835
00:46:08.310 --> 00:46:12.090
about the Belgrade Observatory and so these were astrophysicists

836
00:46:12.090 --> 00:46:14.370
and astronomers. All of the, many of the workers

837
00:46:14.370 --> 00:46:15.850
there were women, but the director was always a

838
00:46:15.850 --> 00:46:19.409
man. And, um, and, and so there was this

839
00:46:19.409 --> 00:46:22.479
question of, well, why was that the case? Well,

840
00:46:22.729 --> 00:46:25.050
it was the case that the directorships of these

841
00:46:25.050 --> 00:46:29.050
places, especially state-owned enterprises, were political positions. You had

842
00:46:29.050 --> 00:46:30.489
to be a member of the Communist Party and

843
00:46:30.489 --> 00:46:31.649
you had to be a member of the Communist

844
00:46:31.649 --> 00:46:35.409
Party in very good standing. And, you know, you

845
00:46:35.409 --> 00:46:38.850
had to be willing to play those politics. And

846
00:46:38.850 --> 00:46:41.449
again, this is that interesting chicken or the egg

847
00:46:41.449 --> 00:46:48.209
question, um. Do women not achieve positions of high

848
00:46:48.209 --> 00:46:53.330
authority in economic terms because of sexism, because of

849
00:46:53.330 --> 00:46:57.659
discrimination, or because they just don't want those positions?

850
00:46:58.209 --> 00:47:00.379
Um, AND in the case of, like, for instance,

851
00:47:00.610 --> 00:47:04.439
Solo Dragoeva in Bulgaria, who was a Politburo member,

852
00:47:04.530 --> 00:47:07.689
she was a very long standing, very influential, very

853
00:47:07.689 --> 00:47:13.689
powerful politburo member. Many people described her as a

854
00:47:13.689 --> 00:47:18.209
very power hungry person, right? She cared a lot

855
00:47:18.209 --> 00:47:21.530
about power and she wanted to maintain power. And

856
00:47:21.530 --> 00:47:24.649
so she was willing to play those games, which

857
00:47:24.649 --> 00:47:27.330
are, you know, those are endemic to any, if

858
00:47:27.330 --> 00:47:30.689
you've read Machiavelli, you know, right? High power comes

859
00:47:30.689 --> 00:47:32.850
with a lot of responsibility. And so I just

860
00:47:32.850 --> 00:47:35.780
think there's also the case that whether it's east

861
00:47:35.780 --> 00:47:39.620
or west, again, this may be a controversial position.

862
00:47:40.219 --> 00:47:43.040
Um, I think there are a lot of women

863
00:47:43.040 --> 00:47:45.239
who are just too damn smart to want to

864
00:47:45.239 --> 00:47:49.080
be in a position of authority, right? Um, BECAUSE

865
00:47:49.080 --> 00:47:51.439
it's a pain. I mean, I'm currently the chair

866
00:47:51.439 --> 00:47:55.870
of my department, which is a prestigious, powerful position,

867
00:47:56.040 --> 00:47:58.800
and I hate it. I can't wait to be

868
00:47:58.800 --> 00:48:01.120
done. And so I could pass it on to

869
00:48:01.120 --> 00:48:02.840
the next idiot who wants to be in charge.

870
00:48:02.959 --> 00:48:05.040
I don't like being in charge. I wanna do

871
00:48:05.040 --> 00:48:07.840
my scholarship, I wanna do my work. Being in

872
00:48:07.840 --> 00:48:12.510
charge is Anyway, that's, that's another conversation. But no,

873
00:48:12.590 --> 00:48:14.669
I mean, this is often a point that is

874
00:48:14.669 --> 00:48:17.590
made by, again, Westerners who say, oh well, there

875
00:48:17.590 --> 00:48:20.030
wasn't really gender equality because there weren't as many

876
00:48:20.030 --> 00:48:23.469
women enterprise directors or hospital directors or polar buro

877
00:48:23.469 --> 00:48:25.510
members in the east as there are in the

878
00:48:25.510 --> 00:48:28.290
west, um. First of all, there aren't that many

879
00:48:28.290 --> 00:48:30.489
in the West either. Um, AND if they are

880
00:48:30.489 --> 00:48:33.370
there, it's often because of quotas or DEI which

881
00:48:33.370 --> 00:48:37.409
Trump is currently completely dismantling, right? Attempts to, to

882
00:48:37.409 --> 00:48:40.570
increase the participation of women and ethnic minorities in

883
00:48:40.570 --> 00:48:44.290
positions of power. Um, BUT, but I also just

884
00:48:44.290 --> 00:48:46.169
think that that, you know, you have to understand

885
00:48:46.169 --> 00:48:49.469
like what are we measuring? If we're measuring just

886
00:48:49.469 --> 00:48:52.870
role models, what what socialists cared about, I think

887
00:48:52.870 --> 00:48:55.879
what socialists still care about, right, is the material

888
00:48:55.879 --> 00:48:59.709
conditions of everyday life. And and whether our politicians

889
00:48:59.709 --> 00:49:02.830
are being responsive to the material conditions of everyday

890
00:49:02.830 --> 00:49:04.429
life. I have to say, and again, you know,

891
00:49:04.550 --> 00:49:06.330
I'm gonna get into trouble, but I don't care.

892
00:49:06.629 --> 00:49:09.870
Um, YOU know, back when Bernie and um Hillary

893
00:49:09.870 --> 00:49:13.500
were running against each other in the Democratic primary

894
00:49:13.500 --> 00:49:17.189
in, in 2016, I was completely for Bernie Sanders.

895
00:49:17.989 --> 00:49:20.969
And I had many friends tell me, how could

896
00:49:20.969 --> 00:49:22.570
I say that I was a feminist? How could

897
00:49:22.570 --> 00:49:25.530
I, like, I was an internal misogyny because I

898
00:49:25.530 --> 00:49:28.040
wasn't voting for Hillary, right? And I was like,

899
00:49:28.290 --> 00:49:31.330
no. Hillary, to me, in my mind at that

900
00:49:31.330 --> 00:49:34.360
time, she was reprehensible. She was not, she She,

901
00:49:34.370 --> 00:49:38.050
she represented the worst of neoliberal capitalist politics in

902
00:49:38.050 --> 00:49:40.689
the United States. I would much rather vote for

903
00:49:40.689 --> 00:49:43.570
a socialist man who I, who, who will improve

904
00:49:43.570 --> 00:49:46.280
the material conditions of working people in my country

905
00:49:46.489 --> 00:49:49.129
than just because to see some woman in the

906
00:49:49.129 --> 00:49:52.370
White House, that I'm not interested in just visuals.

907
00:49:52.449 --> 00:49:55.649
I'm interested in actual policies. And I think that

908
00:49:55.929 --> 00:50:00.760
this conversation about Women in positions of power or

909
00:50:00.760 --> 00:50:04.120
ethnic minorities in positions of power, diversity, it, it

910
00:50:04.120 --> 00:50:07.199
misses the fundamental point of what that is trying

911
00:50:07.199 --> 00:50:09.669
to achieve, which is to improve the material conditions

912
00:50:09.669 --> 00:50:13.120
of people's everyday lives. That's what really matters, you

913
00:50:13.120 --> 00:50:15.959
know, and the irony, if you just let me

914
00:50:15.959 --> 00:50:18.879
allow me this one last little rant, I think

915
00:50:18.879 --> 00:50:23.979
the the irony of Trump. YOU know, 2 Trump

916
00:50:24.199 --> 00:50:27.760
is that people, poor working class people in this

917
00:50:27.760 --> 00:50:32.899
country. Believed, actually believed that he was going to

918
00:50:32.899 --> 00:50:36.780
care for them. And, you know, it was so

919
00:50:36.780 --> 00:50:39.780
patently obvious to most of us that he was

920
00:50:39.780 --> 00:50:44.100
just lying through his teeth, right? Um, AND, and

921
00:50:44.100 --> 00:50:46.580
it's not even been 3 weeks, and it's, he's

922
00:50:46.580 --> 00:50:49.459
shown already that he that that that those people

923
00:50:49.459 --> 00:50:52.340
who voted for him are suckers. He has no

924
00:50:52.340 --> 00:50:55.120
interest whatsoever in improving the material conditions of their

925
00:50:55.120 --> 00:50:59.169
lives. And I think that's the fear. In Europe,

926
00:50:59.229 --> 00:51:02.979
in the United States, that this populism, it appeals

927
00:51:02.979 --> 00:51:07.800
to people who feel like they are the losers

928
00:51:07.800 --> 00:51:10.239
of this global capitalist world that we're living in.

929
00:51:12.219 --> 00:51:16.739
Great. So, finally getting into the topic suggested by

930
00:51:16.739 --> 00:51:21.139
the title of your book, why talk about sex

931
00:51:21.139 --> 00:51:24.060
in this context? I mean, what, what does sex

932
00:51:24.060 --> 00:51:27.429
have to do with economics and the economic system

933
00:51:27.429 --> 00:51:31.645
people live under. And in this case specifically, what

934
00:51:31.645 --> 00:51:34.754
would you say are the aspects of women's sexual

935
00:51:35.014 --> 00:51:38.764
needs and sexual lives that you would argue are

936
00:51:38.764 --> 00:51:44.004
more, more fulfilled under a socialist uh socialist system

937
00:51:44.004 --> 00:51:45.445
than a capitalist system.

938
00:51:46.790 --> 00:51:49.290
Yeah, so there are two parts to this question.

939
00:51:49.379 --> 00:51:51.409
So I think sex has to do with everything,

940
00:51:51.659 --> 00:51:54.580
right? Because if you think about it, like, open

941
00:51:54.580 --> 00:51:57.209
a novel, listen to a pop song, look at

942
00:51:57.209 --> 00:52:01.979
advertisements, we're constantly bombarded by sex all the time.

943
00:52:02.429 --> 00:52:04.669
In one form or another, whether it's the song

944
00:52:04.669 --> 00:52:09.270
lyrics or advertising campaigns, or, you know, beautiful people

945
00:52:09.270 --> 00:52:11.389
telling you that you will look and be like

946
00:52:11.389 --> 00:52:14.310
me if you buy this product, right? So we

947
00:52:14.310 --> 00:52:17.820
use sex all the time to sell things, to

948
00:52:17.820 --> 00:52:20.870
convince people to do things, to make decisions about

949
00:52:20.870 --> 00:52:23.830
their lives. So why not use sex to compare

950
00:52:23.830 --> 00:52:26.959
economic systems? That seems to me a perfectly legitimate

951
00:52:27.510 --> 00:52:31.560
project. Um, AND there's a lot of good. Good

952
00:52:31.790 --> 00:52:34.870
scholarship out there by people like Dagmar Herzog and

953
00:52:34.870 --> 00:52:37.709
Agnieszka Kozanska, Katerina Nkova. I could give you lots

954
00:52:37.709 --> 00:52:39.790
of names of people who are looking at sexuality

955
00:52:39.790 --> 00:52:43.639
as a way of measuring the quality of life

956
00:52:43.830 --> 00:52:48.989
in different societies because happy people have. SEX, right?

957
00:52:49.239 --> 00:52:53.120
Um, AND unhappy people don't have any sex, and

958
00:52:53.120 --> 00:52:56.919
that mean, or they, you know, it's like, you

959
00:52:56.919 --> 00:52:59.439
could really, really see how society is starting to

960
00:52:59.439 --> 00:53:02.040
fall apart when your young people are not interested

961
00:53:02.040 --> 00:53:05.600
in having sex. And that's happening, right? So, so

962
00:53:05.600 --> 00:53:07.159
the first thing is, I think there's a legitimate

963
00:53:07.159 --> 00:53:11.070
question here. But the second thing, Is that, instead

964
00:53:11.070 --> 00:53:15.379
of, instead of saying, are women better off because

965
00:53:15.590 --> 00:53:18.270
there's a female CEO or a woman in the

966
00:53:18.270 --> 00:53:21.919
White House, why not ask this interesting question of,

967
00:53:22.070 --> 00:53:24.989
are women better off because they're more satisfied and

968
00:53:24.989 --> 00:53:29.129
happy in their personal lives. They're actually living, they're

969
00:53:29.129 --> 00:53:32.550
flourishing in their personal lives. That's a different sort

970
00:53:32.550 --> 00:53:35.229
of question. And again, it's about the material conditions.

971
00:53:36.060 --> 00:53:38.639
And so the reason that this is important is

972
00:53:38.639 --> 00:53:41.120
because going back all the way to the 19th

973
00:53:41.120 --> 00:53:44.030
century with the work of people like Bebel and

974
00:53:44.030 --> 00:53:49.149
um Engels, and Flora Tristan, and Alexandra Coenta, there

975
00:53:49.149 --> 00:53:53.429
was this really interesting observation that women could not

976
00:53:53.429 --> 00:53:59.770
be free. Politically, economically, or sexually, until they were

977
00:53:59.770 --> 00:54:03.770
considered fully participant full participants in building our society

978
00:54:03.770 --> 00:54:07.010
and not just in being mothers and wives. And

979
00:54:07.010 --> 00:54:11.639
so this link, Colina writes very explicitly about how

980
00:54:11.639 --> 00:54:15.709
capitalism basically makes every woman a prostitute. In a

981
00:54:15.709 --> 00:54:18.350
system where, whether you're getting married, you're looking for

982
00:54:18.350 --> 00:54:21.070
a husband who's gonna support you, or, you know,

983
00:54:21.189 --> 00:54:23.830
whether you're looking for casual relationships that are gonna

984
00:54:23.830 --> 00:54:26.510
provide you some economic benefit, or if you're on

985
00:54:26.510 --> 00:54:29.429
camera selling pictures of your feet to strangers that

986
00:54:29.429 --> 00:54:33.310
you don't know, all of us have become marketized

987
00:54:33.310 --> 00:54:36.110
in a way, including men, I would argue it's

988
00:54:36.110 --> 00:54:40.810
like, it's universal at this point. But, but that

989
00:54:42.449 --> 00:54:46.850
Commodification of every of every relational transaction, first of

990
00:54:46.850 --> 00:54:50.360
all, is diminishing the quality of our relationships. I

991
00:54:50.360 --> 00:54:53.330
believe that very strongly. It's also making it harder

992
00:54:53.330 --> 00:54:56.489
to form relationships because everybody's worried about who's going

993
00:54:56.489 --> 00:55:00.379
to take advantage of me. And everything becomes very

994
00:55:00.379 --> 00:55:06.370
transactional. And finally, because we've lost the ability in

995
00:55:06.370 --> 00:55:11.969
so many ways to actually define for ourselves what

996
00:55:11.969 --> 00:55:15.750
makes us happy. Right? How do we define happiness

997
00:55:15.750 --> 00:55:18.870
in the absence of Instagram and TikTok telling us

998
00:55:18.870 --> 00:55:20.780
all the things that we should want and be

999
00:55:20.780 --> 00:55:23.669
and do if we just sat down by ourselves

1000
00:55:23.669 --> 00:55:25.070
to try to figure out what we want, it

1001
00:55:25.070 --> 00:55:28.189
would probably be fairly simple things, like spending time

1002
00:55:28.189 --> 00:55:31.790
with our family and friends and having good romantic

1003
00:55:31.790 --> 00:55:34.790
relationships with our partner or partners, as the case

1004
00:55:34.790 --> 00:55:39.250
may be. And so, I think East European countries,

1005
00:55:39.379 --> 00:55:42.419
and there's very good evidence to support this, since

1006
00:55:42.419 --> 00:55:46.139
my book came out. There have been several subsequent

1007
00:55:46.139 --> 00:55:51.919
studies. They have better sex. They had better friends.

1008
00:55:52.040 --> 00:55:55.000
They had more parties. They had more fun because

1009
00:55:55.000 --> 00:55:59.520
they weren't stressed about paying the rent. They weren't

1010
00:55:59.520 --> 00:56:01.760
stressed about having food or not being able to

1011
00:56:01.760 --> 00:56:04.159
go see the doctor. They had a level of

1012
00:56:04.159 --> 00:56:06.219
Social Security. Now, they didn't have many things to

1013
00:56:06.219 --> 00:56:08.959
buy. That's true. They couldn't travel. They, they had

1014
00:56:08.959 --> 00:56:11.560
very limited life opportunities. I'm not denying any of

1015
00:56:11.560 --> 00:56:15.840
that. But when you look at the ethnographic research

1016
00:56:15.840 --> 00:56:19.340
on the quality of everyday relationships between people, one

1017
00:56:19.340 --> 00:56:22.699
of the things That comes out over and over

1018
00:56:22.699 --> 00:56:26.330
and over again is that people who lived under

1019
00:56:26.330 --> 00:56:29.060
socialism, and there are millions of them in the

1020
00:56:29.060 --> 00:56:31.459
world today, will say the quality of their relationships

1021
00:56:31.459 --> 00:56:34.179
were better when there wasn't so much damn hustle

1022
00:56:34.179 --> 00:56:36.540
going on. And I think, you know, a lot

1023
00:56:36.540 --> 00:56:38.419
of us think that like, we closed the door

1024
00:56:38.419 --> 00:56:41.820
and capitalism stays outside of the bedroom. The capitalism

1025
00:56:41.820 --> 00:56:44.340
comes into the bedroom with us. And so if

1026
00:56:44.340 --> 00:56:46.889
we really want to talk about the value and

1027
00:56:46.899 --> 00:56:51.449
and measure the quality of our life, As an

1028
00:56:51.449 --> 00:56:54.889
exercise in imagining a different future, then we, we

1029
00:56:54.889 --> 00:56:58.209
can talk about public policy until the cows come

1030
00:56:58.209 --> 00:57:00.090
home. But I think the most important thing is

1031
00:57:00.090 --> 00:57:02.850
to talk about the quality of our friendships, to

1032
00:57:02.850 --> 00:57:04.689
talk about the quality of our relationships with our

1033
00:57:04.689 --> 00:57:08.169
family, and to talk about our romantic partners. And

1034
00:57:08.169 --> 00:57:10.209
those cause those are the things that everybody cares

1035
00:57:10.209 --> 00:57:10.530
about.

1036
00:57:12.090 --> 00:57:16.090
Mhm. Right. So, uh, I have two more questions

1037
00:57:16.090 --> 00:57:18.729
here. One has to do with the criticism I

1038
00:57:18.729 --> 00:57:22.969
read from the social scientist Alice Evans. Uh, SHE

1039
00:57:22.969 --> 00:57:26.370
wrote it on Twitter, I think. She basically shared

1040
00:57:26.370 --> 00:57:28.959
the cover of your book and then she wrote,

1041
00:57:29.090 --> 00:57:34.090
uh, in truth, Maoists and Soviets crush dissent, enabled

1042
00:57:34.090 --> 00:57:37.489
famine, turned the blind eye to male violence, and

1043
00:57:37.489 --> 00:57:42.824
routinized dangerous abortions. Post-communist countries today are. MA t

1044
00:57:42.824 --> 00:57:47.304
ically more sexist, entrenched by patriarchal executives. I, I

1045
00:57:47.304 --> 00:57:49.665
mean, first of all, let me just comment that

1046
00:57:49.665 --> 00:57:53.264
I think that the first part of the criticism

1047
00:57:53.264 --> 00:57:55.625
you would address and you acknowledge in the book

1048
00:57:55.625 --> 00:57:58.024
that there were these kinds of problems. And the

1049
00:57:58.024 --> 00:58:00.745
second part, I'm not sure if it's really a

1050
00:58:00.745 --> 00:58:05.985
valid criticism because she's already talking about post-communist, capitalist

1051
00:58:05.985 --> 00:58:08.425
country, so, and that's not your argument in the

1052
00:58:08.425 --> 00:58:11.425
book, but anyway, what would be your response?

1053
00:58:11.939 --> 00:58:14.310
I mean, look, I get a lot of people,

1054
00:58:14.679 --> 00:58:16.280
first of all, it's very clear that she didn't

1055
00:58:16.280 --> 00:58:18.239
read the book because I don't talk about Maoism,

1056
00:58:18.320 --> 00:58:21.199
I'm not even talking about China, right? Um, IF

1057
00:58:21.199 --> 00:58:22.459
she had read the book, I mean, people see

1058
00:58:22.459 --> 00:58:26.080
the title and they just react, especially on places

1059
00:58:26.080 --> 00:58:29.610
like Twitter, right? Um, AND, and that's true. Like,

1060
00:58:29.929 --> 00:58:33.360
many, you know, many people say, oh, well, because

1061
00:58:33.649 --> 00:58:38.479
there was a famine, or because there were abortions,

1062
00:58:38.729 --> 00:58:41.929
um, it, it doesn't matter. Any of the other

1063
00:58:41.929 --> 00:58:46.129
achievements don't matter because this one bad thing, right?

1064
00:58:46.659 --> 00:58:48.149
You know, and I, you know, and you could

1065
00:58:48.149 --> 00:58:49.889
make that argument about the United States. You say,

1066
00:58:49.919 --> 00:58:51.560
well, you know, we had a genocide against the

1067
00:58:51.560 --> 00:58:53.860
Native Americans and we had slavery, so it doesn't

1068
00:58:53.860 --> 00:58:56.469
matter that we are now the beacon of free,

1069
00:58:56.550 --> 00:58:59.830
you know, democracy and freedom in the world. Um,

1070
00:58:59.949 --> 00:59:02.679
uh, IT, it's a fundamental, uh, it's, it's a

1071
00:59:02.679 --> 00:59:05.110
bizarre sort of critique. So first of all, just

1072
00:59:05.110 --> 00:59:09.199
as a Rhetorical position. It's a very strange, it's

1073
00:59:09.199 --> 00:59:11.919
like, you know, what about is, right? Um, THIS

1074
00:59:11.919 --> 00:59:15.600
idea that like, you can always, there's no political

1075
00:59:15.600 --> 00:59:18.840
system that's perfect. That's the first thing. Um, AND

1076
00:59:18.840 --> 00:59:21.520
I don't even argue that this political system was

1077
00:59:21.520 --> 00:59:23.919
perfect. In fact, I'm very careful in the book

1078
00:59:23.919 --> 00:59:27.320
to say and enumerate point by point all the

1079
00:59:27.320 --> 00:59:30.000
things that were wrong. So, she didn't read the

1080
00:59:30.000 --> 00:59:32.199
book. But the other thing is, I, you know,

1081
00:59:32.399 --> 00:59:38.479
I think that Entrenched sexism, yeah, after '89, absolutely

1082
00:59:38.850 --> 00:59:43.050
because of capitalism, not because of socialism. So she

1083
00:59:43.050 --> 00:59:45.239
basically just agrees with me. She just doesn't know

1084
00:59:45.239 --> 00:59:46.729
that she agrees with me cause she hasn't read

1085
00:59:46.729 --> 00:59:51.679
the book, right? Um, I think the bigger critique,

1086
00:59:52.050 --> 00:59:55.459
though, I mean, if I were to critique myself,

1087
00:59:55.969 --> 01:00:01.169
um. Is this question of the state, right? Like

1088
01:00:01.169 --> 01:00:04.969
I do I am a believer in the state.

1089
01:00:05.060 --> 01:00:07.790
I think that the state, you know, preferably a

1090
01:00:07.790 --> 01:00:11.699
democratically elected one that is responsive to its constituents.

1091
01:00:12.909 --> 01:00:17.550
Can and should redistribute wealth in order to improve

1092
01:00:17.550 --> 01:00:21.590
the material conditions of people's lives. So I see

1093
01:00:21.590 --> 01:00:23.510
a role for the state and that and that

1094
01:00:23.510 --> 01:00:28.909
book. IS an argument for a state that is

1095
01:00:28.909 --> 01:00:32.070
going to take on a lot of these more

1096
01:00:32.070 --> 01:00:36.179
socialistic type policies in order to improve people's lives.

1097
01:00:36.239 --> 01:00:39.669
And I go to great lengths to explain why

1098
01:00:39.669 --> 01:00:45.530
I think that This can be done and should

1099
01:00:45.530 --> 01:00:53.379
be done. Um. That being said, I'm not sure

1100
01:00:53.379 --> 01:00:55.689
if states are always such a good thing, right?

1101
01:00:56.100 --> 01:00:58.820
Because look what's happening in my country right now.

1102
01:00:59.179 --> 01:01:03.899
Um, THE dismantling of the state, and, um, and,

1103
01:01:04.020 --> 01:01:07.459
and perhaps the weaponization of that state. And so

1104
01:01:07.459 --> 01:01:11.149
to the extent that I have very smart colleagues

1105
01:01:11.500 --> 01:01:14.979
who are kind of more critical of the state.

1106
01:01:15.760 --> 01:01:18.320
Um, THAT'S why I wrote Everyday Utopia, which is

1107
01:01:18.320 --> 01:01:21.080
the follow-up book to this one, was to sort

1108
01:01:21.080 --> 01:01:26.040
of take uh take quite seriously what we as

1109
01:01:26.040 --> 01:01:30.010
people, as ordinary people can do. In the absence

1110
01:01:30.010 --> 01:01:32.649
of a state, because I'm not so sure that

1111
01:01:32.649 --> 01:01:35.689
the state in the long term is going to

1112
01:01:35.689 --> 01:01:39.340
be our state salvation in the way that I

1113
01:01:39.340 --> 01:01:42.030
would really love it to be. Um, AND so

1114
01:01:42.030 --> 01:01:46.580
to me, my biggest critique of my book is

1115
01:01:46.580 --> 01:01:49.300
that it's, it's, it's anachron like in some ways

1116
01:01:49.300 --> 01:01:55.729
it is anachronistic, right? That that kind of Sort

1117
01:01:55.729 --> 01:01:59.330
of welfare state as it existed, because it existed

1118
01:01:59.330 --> 01:02:01.889
in Western Europe too, even existed in the United

1119
01:02:01.889 --> 01:02:06.489
States, this really robust redistributive welfare state may have

1120
01:02:06.489 --> 01:02:09.870
been a unique product of the 20th century. And

1121
01:02:09.870 --> 01:02:13.629
it may be that in our world today, because

1122
01:02:13.629 --> 01:02:16.469
of the atomization, because of AI, because of technology,

1123
01:02:16.709 --> 01:02:19.629
because of globalization, because of various things that are

1124
01:02:19.629 --> 01:02:24.149
just different, qualitatively different than they were 70 or

1125
01:02:24.149 --> 01:02:27.350
80 years ago, that that kind of robust welfare

1126
01:02:27.350 --> 01:02:31.189
state may just not be possible. Um, AND that,

1127
01:02:31.310 --> 01:02:33.629
I mean, that gives me pause. I'm not saying

1128
01:02:33.629 --> 01:02:35.110
that I don't think we should still fight for

1129
01:02:35.110 --> 01:02:37.469
it. I'm just saying that it gives me pause.

1130
01:02:38.250 --> 01:02:41.969
Mhm. So one last question then, how do you

1131
01:02:41.969 --> 01:02:46.370
look at current trends in socialism across the world

1132
01:02:46.370 --> 01:02:50.330
or in the United States specifically, and the future

1133
01:02:50.330 --> 01:02:53.330
of socialism? And are you hopeful about it? Are

1134
01:02:53.330 --> 01:02:57.090
you pessimistic? I mean, what's your, what are your

1135
01:02:57.090 --> 01:02:57.939
ideas about it?

1136
01:02:58.290 --> 01:03:02.449
So it depends on the day. Um, BECAUSE I

1137
01:03:02.449 --> 01:03:06.530
definitely tack back and forth. Um, ON the one

1138
01:03:06.530 --> 01:03:12.060
hand, I think I, you know, the left is

1139
01:03:12.060 --> 01:03:18.459
very good. At criticizing and destroying itself. Um, THAT,

1140
01:03:18.510 --> 01:03:20.709
you know, so like in the United States, you

1141
01:03:20.709 --> 01:03:24.870
know, these, this sort of whole woke phenomenon where

1142
01:03:24.870 --> 01:03:28.459
everything became about a very narrow set of identity

1143
01:03:28.459 --> 01:03:32.750
politics to the exclusion of actual concerns for the

1144
01:03:32.750 --> 01:03:37.070
material conditions of people's lives, that resulted in the

1145
01:03:37.070 --> 01:03:39.550
white working class of the United States voting Republican.

1146
01:03:40.110 --> 01:03:42.629
Um, AND I, and I think that's the responsibility

1147
01:03:42.629 --> 01:03:45.280
of, of, of leftist leaders in the United States

1148
01:03:45.280 --> 01:03:49.469
because they, they hyperfocused on issues that um alienated

1149
01:03:49.469 --> 01:03:51.879
the vast majority of working class people in this

1150
01:03:51.879 --> 01:03:53.879
country. And that is a problem in many, many

1151
01:03:53.879 --> 01:03:57.260
socialist movements. So, so that's a, that's a real

1152
01:03:57.260 --> 01:03:59.760
problem. And, and then the minute socialists get into

1153
01:03:59.760 --> 01:04:03.520
power, historically, they tend to immediately start fighting against

1154
01:04:03.520 --> 01:04:05.760
each other. And so they, they tend to be

1155
01:04:05.760 --> 01:04:10.429
very ineffective, right? Because, um, you know, unless, anyway,

1156
01:04:10.870 --> 01:04:13.959
there's a, there's a whole kind of interesting psychological

1157
01:04:14.750 --> 01:04:17.030
analysis that could be done about this sort of

1158
01:04:17.030 --> 01:04:19.870
long-term issue of it, I think that there's a

1159
01:04:19.870 --> 01:04:22.469
kind of internal fear of people like Stalin and

1160
01:04:22.469 --> 01:04:27.479
Mao, like this heavy-handed patriarchal kind of authoritarian leader.

1161
01:04:27.520 --> 01:04:30.149
And so there's this tendency to fracture in ways

1162
01:04:30.149 --> 01:04:31.899
that make it very hard to get things done.

1163
01:04:32.110 --> 01:04:38.469
That being said, The one time Several times when

1164
01:04:38.469 --> 01:04:43.530
socialists have been really effective. Incredibly effective, I would

1165
01:04:43.530 --> 01:04:46.929
say, is when there are fascists or right wing

1166
01:04:46.929 --> 01:04:50.179
people in power. Because the one thing that socialists

1167
01:04:50.179 --> 01:04:53.580
can do and have done is form Popular Front

1168
01:04:53.580 --> 01:04:57.540
movements. They're very good at building coalitions when it's

1169
01:04:57.540 --> 01:05:00.899
necessary. And so right now, I think we're at

1170
01:05:00.899 --> 01:05:04.409
a moment where this sort of more populist right-wing

1171
01:05:05.139 --> 01:05:09.449
politics is in ascendancy. It seems like it's sweeping,

1172
01:05:09.659 --> 01:05:12.820
you know, this, this sort of strong male dictator

1173
01:05:12.820 --> 01:05:16.379
figure that we've seen in the past. Um, THE

1174
01:05:16.379 --> 01:05:18.219
one thing that socialists are really good at is

1175
01:05:18.219 --> 01:05:22.639
undermining that particular formulation of power by creating broad

1176
01:05:22.639 --> 01:05:26.800
Popular Front coalitions. And so as the world changes,

1177
01:05:27.379 --> 01:05:31.139
On my better days, I'm actually happy when I

1178
01:05:31.139 --> 01:05:37.459
see socialists creating coalitions between environmentalists and feminists, and

1179
01:05:37.459 --> 01:05:41.739
anarchists, and, you know, broad spectrum coalitions in order

1180
01:05:41.739 --> 01:05:45.959
to get things done. So, So I think, you

1181
01:05:45.959 --> 01:05:52.139
know, globally, socialism is still emerging from the hangover

1182
01:05:52.139 --> 01:05:55.270
of this 20th century failure of the Soviet Union.

1183
01:05:56.020 --> 01:06:01.250
But, but it's receding in time. And so people

1184
01:06:01.250 --> 01:06:05.489
like me, but many of my colleagues are basically

1185
01:06:05.489 --> 01:06:07.649
trying to go back and do a kind of

1186
01:06:07.649 --> 01:06:12.770
postmortem, a debrief and say, OK, those societies didn't

1187
01:06:12.770 --> 01:06:16.050
work, but are there things in those societies such

1188
01:06:16.050 --> 01:06:19.040
as policies towards women and families that we can

1189
01:06:19.040 --> 01:06:22.500
rescue. Get rid of the bad stuff, keep the

1190
01:06:22.500 --> 01:06:26.850
good stuff, and um move towards a new kind

1191
01:06:26.850 --> 01:06:30.629
of different sort of socialism in the future. You

1192
01:06:30.629 --> 01:06:32.870
know, I think there are many things that were

1193
01:06:32.870 --> 01:06:36.870
commendable about these societies, their investments in art, their

1194
01:06:36.870 --> 01:06:42.149
investments in science, you know, their um concern uh

1195
01:06:42.149 --> 01:06:44.510
with obviously women's rights. I mean, there are lots

1196
01:06:44.510 --> 01:06:46.590
of things that we can think about the ways

1197
01:06:46.590 --> 01:06:51.340
in which they facilitated. Um, SOCIAL mobility and the

1198
01:06:51.340 --> 01:06:55.389
ways in which ordinary people had basic sort of

1199
01:06:55.389 --> 01:06:58.889
security in terms of healthcare and housing and food

1200
01:06:58.889 --> 01:07:01.739
security in a way that we don't have in

1201
01:07:01.739 --> 01:07:04.820
the West. So, what are the things that we

1202
01:07:04.820 --> 01:07:07.209
could learn? What are the things that we should

1203
01:07:07.209 --> 01:07:10.729
definitely not do again? Um, I think that is

1204
01:07:10.729 --> 01:07:15.770
a really urgent project for academics, but also, you

1205
01:07:15.770 --> 01:07:19.120
know, ordinary people today to educate themselves, not just

1206
01:07:19.120 --> 01:07:23.689
to imbibe these Cold War stereotypes about famine and

1207
01:07:23.689 --> 01:07:27.489
about, um, you know, uh, you know, waiting in

1208
01:07:27.489 --> 01:07:29.959
line to buy toilet paper, right? There are these,

1209
01:07:30.169 --> 01:07:32.620
there are these stereotypes that are out there that

1210
01:07:32.620 --> 01:07:37.870
completely occlude. Other things that um we might be

1211
01:07:37.870 --> 01:07:39.510
able to learn because, like, one of the things

1212
01:07:39.510 --> 01:07:40.949
that I do is I read a lot of

1213
01:07:40.949 --> 01:07:43.540
documents, for instance, from the 70s and the 80s,

1214
01:07:43.590 --> 01:07:48.189
from Western sources who were analyzing social policies and

1215
01:07:48.189 --> 01:07:50.629
things that were happening in the Eastern bloc, and

1216
01:07:50.629 --> 01:07:54.699
they're so much more objective. Than anything that was

1217
01:07:54.699 --> 01:07:57.199
written in the 90s or the 2000s, because of

1218
01:07:57.199 --> 01:07:58.659
the victor, you know, to, what is it, the,

1219
01:07:58.860 --> 01:08:01.379
the history is written by the victors, right? After

1220
01:08:01.379 --> 01:08:02.969
the Cold War, we could go back and say

1221
01:08:02.969 --> 01:08:05.219
everything about this was awful. But during the Cold

1222
01:08:05.219 --> 01:08:07.820
War, people were actually learning from what the Eastern

1223
01:08:07.820 --> 01:08:11.219
Bloc was doing, right? There were a polyclinic systems,

1224
01:08:11.300 --> 01:08:14.610
healthcare systems, so much interesting scholarship has been done.

1225
01:08:14.739 --> 01:08:17.899
So, From a scholarly perspective, I think there's a

1226
01:08:17.899 --> 01:08:21.790
recuperative project, and from a political perspective, I think

1227
01:08:21.790 --> 01:08:24.939
we need hope. I think we need hope, and

1228
01:08:24.939 --> 01:08:26.979
I think that that the one good thing, as

1229
01:08:26.979 --> 01:08:30.419
I said, about leftist politics is in times of

1230
01:08:30.419 --> 01:08:35.109
hopelessness. It's often the socialists and the anarchists and

1231
01:08:35.109 --> 01:08:37.660
the environmentalists and the feminists. It's often them who

1232
01:08:37.660 --> 01:08:40.779
bring the hope. They bring the possibility of change,

1233
01:08:41.029 --> 01:08:45.229
and they convince ordinary people that that things can

1234
01:08:45.229 --> 01:08:47.629
be changed. And I think that's a really important

1235
01:08:47.629 --> 01:08:49.750
role for these social movements. Even if they, you

1236
01:08:49.750 --> 01:08:52.310
know, as a percentage of the parliamentary, you know,

1237
01:08:52.660 --> 01:08:56.310
representation, they're small, they, they, they punch above their

1238
01:08:56.310 --> 01:08:58.750
weight. I, I think about like the Belgian Workers'

1239
01:08:58.750 --> 01:09:02.790
Party in Belgium, you know. This is a small

1240
01:09:02.790 --> 01:09:07.350
workers' party, um, very socialist, but they are so

1241
01:09:07.350 --> 01:09:11.870
important, and they're so respected in that political context,

1242
01:09:11.879 --> 01:09:15.589
because they get things done, right? Um, BECAUSE they

1243
01:09:15.589 --> 01:09:18.370
live by a set of principles that, that people,

1244
01:09:18.430 --> 01:09:20.939
that appeal to people, that people understand, they speak

1245
01:09:20.939 --> 01:09:24.419
the language of the people. And so, in my

1246
01:09:24.910 --> 01:09:29.129
more optimistic moments, I hope The socialists and social

1247
01:09:29.129 --> 01:09:32.879
movements of the left will learn from the past

1248
01:09:33.129 --> 01:09:36.330
and also take those lessons and move forward with

1249
01:09:36.330 --> 01:09:39.600
hope and positivity for change in the future.

1250
01:09:41.118 --> 01:09:43.818
Great. So the book is again Why Women have

1251
01:09:43.818 --> 01:09:46.898
better sex and the Socialism and other arguments for

1252
01:09:46.898 --> 01:09:49.337
economic independence. I will be leaving a link to

1253
01:09:49.337 --> 01:09:52.328
it in the description of the interview. And Doctor

1254
01:09:52.328 --> 01:09:55.488
Goy, just before we go, apart from the book,

1255
01:09:55.778 --> 01:09:59.179
would you like to reference any places on the

1256
01:09:59.179 --> 01:10:02.139
internet where people can find you and your work?

1257
01:10:02.629 --> 01:10:07.990
Yeah, so my, uh, website is just www.christenosy.com, very

1258
01:10:07.990 --> 01:10:11.459
easy. Um, YOU know, there's links to everything there,

1259
01:10:11.629 --> 01:10:15.629
links to articles. Um, MY faculty webpage at the

1260
01:10:15.629 --> 01:10:19.450
University of Pennsylvania also has, uh, some links there.

1261
01:10:19.910 --> 01:10:23.109
There's a column archive at Jacobin, um, for things

1262
01:10:23.109 --> 01:10:24.629
that I've written there. I mean, I, I, I

1263
01:10:24.629 --> 01:10:27.790
write pretty broadly, so. Um, THE best place is

1264
01:10:27.790 --> 01:10:30.350
just on my, my landing page. I'm not really

1265
01:10:30.350 --> 01:10:33.509
a social media person, so I just have a

1266
01:10:33.509 --> 01:10:33.950
website.

1267
01:10:35.189 --> 01:10:37.629
Great. I will, I will also be leaving links

1268
01:10:37.629 --> 01:10:40.040
