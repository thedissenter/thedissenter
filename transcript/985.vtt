00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:03.170
Hello, everyone. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:06.030
Decent. I'm your host, Ricardo Lob. And today I'm

3
00:00:06.039 --> 00:00:09.079
here with a very special guest, returned guest, Doctor

4
00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:12.050
Philip Ball. In our first interview, we talked about

5
00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:15.170
his Book of Minds and I'm leaving a link

6
00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:18.209
with in the description of this one. And today

7
00:00:18.219 --> 00:00:21.670
we're talking about his latest book, How Life Works.

8
00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:25.299
A user's guide to the new biology. So, Doctor

9
00:00:25.309 --> 00:00:27.549
Ball, welcome back to the show. It's always a

10
00:00:27.559 --> 00:00:29.200
huge pleasure to everyone.

11
00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:31.780
Thanks for having me back, right? It's very nice.

12
00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:36.819
So, since we're talking about life today, let me

13
00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:40.000
perhaps start with what I would think is a

14
00:00:40.009 --> 00:00:43.810
basic question, but perhaps one of the most complicated

15
00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:46.939
ones. So what is life? I mean, is there

16
00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.840
any approach in, for example, physics or chemistry for

17
00:00:51.849 --> 00:00:55.040
us to be able to differentiate any sort of

18
00:00:55.049 --> 00:01:00.360
criteria to differentiate the organic from the organic living

19
00:01:00.369 --> 00:01:03.569
things, from nonliving things or not?

20
00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:07.300
Well, if there is no one has agreed on

21
00:01:07.309 --> 00:01:09.919
what that is. So I think it's fair to

22
00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.180
say that at the moment, there is no generally

23
00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:17.139
agreed definition of what life is, um which is

24
00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:19.050
amazing when you think about it, you know, it

25
00:01:19.059 --> 00:01:21.559
seems a, such a fundamental thing and such a,

26
00:01:21.569 --> 00:01:24.309
a kind of an obvious thing that surrounds us,

27
00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.839
but we cannot say scientifically exactly what it is

28
00:01:27.849 --> 00:01:30.660
that distinguishes a living thing from a nonliving thing.

29
00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.470
Um So the, the, the approach I take in

30
00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:35.930
my book, I mean, fortunately I don't have to

31
00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:39.769
answer that question. Although II I can't steer entirely

32
00:01:39.779 --> 00:01:42.489
away from it. But I'm talking about in the

33
00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:45.279
book about those things that we know are alive

34
00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:50.839
and particularly about how our biology works. But in

35
00:01:50.849 --> 00:01:54.480
looking at that one can't avoid that more general

36
00:01:54.489 --> 00:01:57.980
question. What is it that distinguishes, you know, these

37
00:01:57.989 --> 00:02:00.269
living things? And one of the things that I

38
00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:04.410
suggest in the book is in contrast to what,

39
00:02:04.419 --> 00:02:06.489
what, what often happens is that you get these

40
00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:09.508
lists of, you know, what living things should uh

41
00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:13.649
require these criteria. So they should be, um you

42
00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:16.949
know, self reproducing or self replicating. They should have

43
00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:20.449
metabolism, you know, maybe there's homeostasis and so on.

44
00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:23.729
All of those things, certainly properties that we find

45
00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:26.100
in living things. But the problem with lists like

46
00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:30.029
that is that we almost inevitably tend to find

47
00:02:30.039 --> 00:02:32.350
that there are systems that have at least some

48
00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:34.919
of those properties that we don't regard as living

49
00:02:34.929 --> 00:02:38.160
things like tornadoes or, you know, things in the,

50
00:02:38.169 --> 00:02:40.589
the nonliving world that have a kind of self

51
00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:45.119
organizing capacity, but that we wouldn't regard as alive.

52
00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:47.789
And then perhaps there are some things that living

53
00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:50.059
things do that it, it, it seemed to be

54
00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:53.660
excluded from a list like that. And it seems

55
00:02:53.669 --> 00:02:56.990
clear that there are these very few systems, in

56
00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
particular viruses that seem to be right on the

57
00:03:00.009 --> 00:03:03.660
threshold of life and there's no consensus about whether

58
00:03:03.669 --> 00:03:07.710
viruses are actually living systems or not. So, what

59
00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:10.080
I, um, end up doing in, in the book

60
00:03:10.089 --> 00:03:13.960
is to suggest that although this shouldn't be an

61
00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:16.800
absolute criterion of life, I think a more fruitful

62
00:03:16.809 --> 00:03:19.949
way to think about what it is that living

63
00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:24.589
systems have that makes them different from nonliving is

64
00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:28.309
a notion called agency. And maybe we'll, you know,

65
00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:30.690
get on to uh explore that idea in, in,

66
00:03:30.699 --> 00:03:32.820
in more detail later. But, uh you know, in

67
00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:36.250
a nutshell agency, I it seems to me it

68
00:03:36.259 --> 00:03:40.309
captures intuitively what we see living things do, which

69
00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:43.589
is that they have some capacity to change their

70
00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:47.929
environment and change themselves most crucially in order to

71
00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:52.729
achieve some particular goal, they have goals and purposes

72
00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:55.860
and that's not something that we see in nonliving

73
00:03:55.869 --> 00:03:59.850
systems, even complex ones like tornadoes. So it's that

74
00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:02.979
notion of goal directed that I think lies at

75
00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:06.770
the heart of life and of biology and that

76
00:04:06.779 --> 00:04:09.289
we'll see sort of coming up again and again,

77
00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:11.809
as we try to understand what makes life work,

78
00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:15.759
so whether we will come back to agency, but

79
00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:19.160
I guess that perhaps there, you might have been

80
00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:24.010
partially influenced by Doctor Kevin Mitchell through his book

81
00:04:24.019 --> 00:04:27.170
Free Agents or something like that or not.

82
00:04:27.179 --> 00:04:30.700
I, I absolutely Dr Drew on, on Kevin's work,

83
00:04:30.709 --> 00:04:34.350
his book Free Agents, which looks at what this

84
00:04:34.359 --> 00:04:38.250
notion might mean and how it, uh, evolved throughout

85
00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:42.089
time. It's, it's a fabulous, um, Kevin and I

86
00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:46.089
realized actually that we were both thinking about agency,

87
00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:48.730
you know, at the same time, independently of, of,

88
00:04:48.739 --> 00:04:51.369
of one another. Kevin. I, you know, don't hesitate

89
00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:53.529
to say Kevin has thought about this more deeply

90
00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:56.209
than I have and goes into this question more

91
00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:58.600
deeply than I have in his book. So it

92
00:04:58.609 --> 00:05:01.790
was a fabulous resource to me. But, but, you

93
00:05:01.799 --> 00:05:04.510
know, the two of us, um we were thinking

94
00:05:04.519 --> 00:05:06.950
that this notion of agency seems to have some

95
00:05:06.959 --> 00:05:09.470
currency and we weren't alone either. There are many

96
00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:13.429
other uh biologists and others philosophers of biology who

97
00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:16.600
are starting to think uh in terms of a

98
00:05:16.609 --> 00:05:19.380
notion of agency and are thinking, you know, we

99
00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:21.630
really need to try to pin this down and

100
00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:24.049
ideally to get a theory of agency in order

101
00:05:24.059 --> 00:05:26.679
to understand life. So I think both of us

102
00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:29.350
are actually part of a broader movement that's going

103
00:05:29.359 --> 00:05:32.399
on. The controversial one I should say within biology

104
00:05:32.429 --> 00:05:34.890
to get to grips with this notion of agency.

105
00:05:35.679 --> 00:05:40.059
But related to my first question, does it really

106
00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:43.010
matter or do we really need to have a

107
00:05:43.019 --> 00:05:48.239
proper universal consensual definition of life, I mean, because

108
00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:50.850
wasn't it the case that we were able to

109
00:05:50.859 --> 00:05:56.195
learn things about how genes work and how genes

110
00:05:56.204 --> 00:06:00.334
relate to other molecules in our body and stuff

111
00:06:00.345 --> 00:06:04.054
like that and things about different kinds of organisms

112
00:06:04.065 --> 00:06:08.454
without having a proper universal definition of what a

113
00:06:08.464 --> 00:06:11.565
gene or what the species is. And those are

114
00:06:11.575 --> 00:06:13.595
just two examples, I guess.

115
00:06:13.899 --> 00:06:16.040
Yeah. Well, I think it depends on the questions

116
00:06:16.049 --> 00:06:18.160
you want to ask. So, if you're a biologist

117
00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:20.679
wanting to understand how the human body works or

118
00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:22.989
how bacteria work or how plants work or whatever,

119
00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.079
then you don't have to wrestle with that question

120
00:06:25.209 --> 00:06:28.500
because, you know, you know, the, the, the subject

121
00:06:28.510 --> 00:06:32.040
of your, um uh of your investigations, you know,

122
00:06:32.049 --> 00:06:34.910
that it's, uh, it makes it, that it's meaningful

123
00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:37.279
and has always been meaningful to think of it

124
00:06:37.290 --> 00:06:39.769
as being alive as having this property. So you

125
00:06:39.779 --> 00:06:42.000
don't have to think about it more than that.

126
00:06:42.149 --> 00:06:43.645
I mean, I, I find that it's a little

127
00:06:43.656 --> 00:06:46.966
bit analogous to, uh in quantum mechanics, how plenty

128
00:06:46.976 --> 00:06:50.015
of people, you know, most physicists um, who use

129
00:06:50.026 --> 00:06:52.786
quantum mechanics don't have to think about what it

130
00:06:52.795 --> 00:06:55.665
actually means, which again is a question that actually

131
00:06:55.675 --> 00:06:58.605
we don't have any consensus about they just get

132
00:06:58.615 --> 00:07:01.135
on and do, do the work. Um So, you

133
00:07:01.145 --> 00:07:03.355
know, you can work this way in biology. But

134
00:07:03.365 --> 00:07:06.506
if you're someone like an astrobiologist who is searching

135
00:07:06.515 --> 00:07:09.476
for life on other worlds, then you have to

136
00:07:09.485 --> 00:07:12.471
have some sort of criterion for what you're looking

137
00:07:12.481 --> 00:07:15.532
for. Um And so, you know, there it really

138
00:07:15.541 --> 00:07:17.971
does become important to really try to get to

139
00:07:17.981 --> 00:07:20.971
grips with. Well, what is it that's characteristic of

140
00:07:20.981 --> 00:07:23.891
what we would recognize as a living thing, you

141
00:07:23.902 --> 00:07:25.891
know, and how can we look for that in,

142
00:07:25.902 --> 00:07:28.041
in other worlds? And then you start to get

143
00:07:28.052 --> 00:07:30.971
into questions. I mean, going back to the, the

144
00:07:30.981 --> 00:07:34.092
definition that uh James Lovelock in the 19 sixties

145
00:07:34.101 --> 00:07:37.411
came up with for the um the Mars Viking,

146
00:07:37.421 --> 00:07:40.859
uh nasa's Viking missions, the Lander missions uh where

147
00:07:40.869 --> 00:07:43.320
they were wanting to, you know, analyze the Martian

148
00:07:43.329 --> 00:07:45.140
soil and see if there were signs of life

149
00:07:45.149 --> 00:07:46.480
and they needed to know what they were looking

150
00:07:46.489 --> 00:07:50.899
for. And Jim Lovelock suggested that a good criterion

151
00:07:50.910 --> 00:07:55.140
would be to look for quite extreme chemical disequilibrium,

152
00:07:55.149 --> 00:07:59.059
which means mixtures of chemicals that normally wouldn't be

153
00:07:59.070 --> 00:08:01.940
found, wouldn't be stable in that mixture, they would

154
00:08:01.950 --> 00:08:05.660
react and, you know, reach some kind of equilibrium

155
00:08:05.670 --> 00:08:09.959
system. Um But if you see a strong disequilibrium

156
00:08:09.970 --> 00:08:11.940
and that's what we see on the earth, that's

157
00:08:11.950 --> 00:08:14.579
what we see in our atmosphere, in particular, for

158
00:08:14.589 --> 00:08:18.079
example, a mixture of uh of lots of oxygen

159
00:08:18.089 --> 00:08:21.755
which is very rare molecule and uh and methane

160
00:08:21.765 --> 00:08:24.725
and other uh molecules like that, that has just

161
00:08:24.734 --> 00:08:27.415
clearly been sustained, you know, for a long period

162
00:08:27.424 --> 00:08:30.255
of time and hasn't settled down into an equilibrium

163
00:08:30.375 --> 00:08:33.635
that is being driven by the eco by the,

164
00:08:33.645 --> 00:08:36.719
the biosphere. Um And so that was, this was

165
00:08:36.729 --> 00:08:39.700
Jim's idea back in the 19 sixties. Um That,

166
00:08:39.710 --> 00:08:41.450
that's maybe what we should look for. We should

167
00:08:41.460 --> 00:08:44.859
look for chemical disequilibrium. But that's not enough. You

168
00:08:44.869 --> 00:08:46.989
know, we recognize that's not enough because there are

169
00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.890
geological processes that can create that sort of disequilibrium

170
00:08:50.900 --> 00:08:54.994
over long periods. So that's a start for astrobiologists.

171
00:08:55.005 --> 00:08:58.094
But again, you know, it's not enough and that's

172
00:08:58.104 --> 00:09:00.135
the big challenge they now face now that we're

173
00:09:00.145 --> 00:09:02.335
able to go to other worlds and look at

174
00:09:02.344 --> 00:09:05.395
the atmospheres of other planets, even outside our solar

175
00:09:05.405 --> 00:09:07.905
system. What are we looking for if we're looking

176
00:09:07.914 --> 00:09:08.604
for life?

177
00:09:09.309 --> 00:09:13.150
Mhm uh But of course, since life is such

178
00:09:13.159 --> 00:09:17.559
a complicated subject to talk about many times, we

179
00:09:17.570 --> 00:09:21.289
people not just lay people, but even sometimes even

180
00:09:21.299 --> 00:09:26.609
the scientists themselves resort to metaphors, like for example,

181
00:09:26.619 --> 00:09:31.130
talking about living systems as machines, as computers or

182
00:09:31.140 --> 00:09:34.500
something along those lines. And of course, throughout history,

183
00:09:34.510 --> 00:09:37.650
people have thought about life in different ways and

184
00:09:37.659 --> 00:09:41.070
through different method, metaphors, do you think that these

185
00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:45.140
metaphors might be useful in some way or are

186
00:09:45.150 --> 00:09:49.260
they just problematic? And if possible, we should just

187
00:09:49.270 --> 00:09:53.929
try to drop them because of the wrong ideas

188
00:09:53.940 --> 00:09:55.309
that they convey?

189
00:09:55.900 --> 00:09:59.280
Well, II, I think that metaphors are essential, they're

190
00:09:59.289 --> 00:10:02.630
essential in science. And actually, I think they're essential

191
00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:05.859
in language generally, you know, we speak in terms

192
00:10:05.869 --> 00:10:08.919
of metaphors. Um So they, they are uh a

193
00:10:08.929 --> 00:10:12.960
fundamental aspect of our thinking. Um So there's no

194
00:10:12.969 --> 00:10:15.869
getting away from them and they are very useful

195
00:10:15.880 --> 00:10:19.320
and, you know, even metaphors um that, you know,

196
00:10:19.330 --> 00:10:22.304
will once used hundreds of years ago to understand

197
00:10:22.315 --> 00:10:24.924
maybe life or to understand complex systems that uh

198
00:10:24.934 --> 00:10:28.164
we now regard maybe as quite naive, they were

199
00:10:28.174 --> 00:10:31.224
still useful in their time. I think the problem

200
00:10:31.234 --> 00:10:35.155
I I perceive with some of these metaphors is

201
00:10:35.164 --> 00:10:38.825
that there is no mechanism for knowing when to

202
00:10:38.835 --> 00:10:41.705
dump them, when to get rid of them, recognizing

203
00:10:41.715 --> 00:10:44.604
when they are no longer useful. And you know,

204
00:10:44.614 --> 00:10:47.255
it struck me uh in thinking about this, particularly

205
00:10:47.265 --> 00:10:50.320
in terms of life that um i it's kind

206
00:10:50.330 --> 00:10:52.450
of peculiar that science is in this position, we

207
00:10:52.460 --> 00:10:55.450
have a mechanism uh in theory, at least anyway,

208
00:10:55.460 --> 00:10:58.380
a mechanism for getting rid of theories that are

209
00:10:58.390 --> 00:11:01.130
no longer useful because, you know, we test them

210
00:11:01.140 --> 00:11:04.409
against experiment. And if the theory and the experiment

211
00:11:04.419 --> 00:11:07.070
conflict, often enough, we start to think maybe the

212
00:11:07.080 --> 00:11:10.510
theory needs changing. So that's fine. There's nothing like

213
00:11:10.520 --> 00:11:13.674
that with me. And so metaphors can stick around

214
00:11:13.684 --> 00:11:17.335
and often do longer than they're welcome and longer

215
00:11:17.344 --> 00:11:21.094
than they're useful. And I think the idea that

216
00:11:21.275 --> 00:11:25.445
living organisms are kind of machines to, to my

217
00:11:25.455 --> 00:11:28.424
mind, that seems to be one of these metaphors

218
00:11:28.434 --> 00:11:30.934
that has stuck around for too long. It's no

219
00:11:30.945 --> 00:11:33.900
longer helpful to think about it that way. Um

220
00:11:33.909 --> 00:11:36.260
Or rather perhaps I should say, because I think

221
00:11:36.270 --> 00:11:39.150
it is nuanced. I think there are situations certainly

222
00:11:39.159 --> 00:11:42.770
there are situations in biology where thinking of an

223
00:11:42.780 --> 00:11:45.900
a component of a biological system like a protein,

224
00:11:45.909 --> 00:11:49.140
for example, as a kind of machine that makes

225
00:11:49.150 --> 00:11:51.820
absolute sense. And some of them look rema and

226
00:11:51.830 --> 00:11:54.794
a few of them look remarkably light machines. So

227
00:11:54.804 --> 00:11:58.215
you have the bacteria, the bacterial flagellum, for example,

228
00:11:58.224 --> 00:12:01.875
which is a protein sort of assembly that allows

229
00:12:01.885 --> 00:12:04.275
the uh these flagella, these sort of whip like

230
00:12:04.284 --> 00:12:07.325
appendages to spin round and let some bacteria swim.

231
00:12:07.424 --> 00:12:09.955
It looks just like a rotary motor in all

232
00:12:09.965 --> 00:12:12.215
sorts of ways. And so it makes sense to

233
00:12:12.224 --> 00:12:15.179
talk about it in that machine like way. But

234
00:12:15.190 --> 00:12:17.830
when we think about how the whole organism works,

235
00:12:17.840 --> 00:12:20.520
the more closely we think about that, the less

236
00:12:20.530 --> 00:12:23.780
and less it looks like any sort of machine

237
00:12:23.789 --> 00:12:27.229
that we have ever made, it works in quite

238
00:12:27.239 --> 00:12:30.299
different ways. And so to, to my mind, the

239
00:12:30.309 --> 00:12:33.840
machine metaphor then starts to become not just uh

240
00:12:33.849 --> 00:12:39.510
um uh inappropriate but actually potentially misleading. Um And

241
00:12:39.520 --> 00:12:42.219
that, you know, that's being very controversial. There are

242
00:12:42.229 --> 00:12:45.349
some people who feel that actually thinking about us

243
00:12:45.359 --> 00:12:49.849
as machines that that's really a way of saying

244
00:12:50.010 --> 00:12:52.659
I'm just a materialist ID. I don't think there's

245
00:12:52.669 --> 00:12:56.090
any sort of mystical, you know, vital spirit that's

246
00:12:56.099 --> 00:13:00.539
animating us. It's just atoms doing stuff. And, you

247
00:13:00.549 --> 00:13:04.049
know, that's actually, that's, I'm happy with that materialistic

248
00:13:04.059 --> 00:13:06.580
position myself. I'm happy to say that, you know,

249
00:13:06.590 --> 00:13:08.070
at the root of it all we, if we

250
00:13:08.080 --> 00:13:10.929
look far enough down, all we see is atoms

251
00:13:10.940 --> 00:13:15.489
interacting, there's nothing mysterious uh beyond that. That's fine.

252
00:13:15.729 --> 00:13:18.270
But my problem is that w that when we

253
00:13:18.280 --> 00:13:20.299
start to look at the higher levels of how

254
00:13:20.309 --> 00:13:24.190
living systems work, they're not machine like, so it's

255
00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:27.340
not a helpful metaphor anymore. So, one of the

256
00:13:27.349 --> 00:13:29.450
things I wanted to try to do in my

257
00:13:29.460 --> 00:13:31.750
book is to think, well, what are the more

258
00:13:31.760 --> 00:13:34.859
useful metaphors that, you know, we now might want

259
00:13:34.869 --> 00:13:38.390
to call on in order to understand these things?

260
00:13:38.492 --> 00:13:42.643
Um And more broadly than that, what is the

261
00:13:42.653 --> 00:13:45.442
more useful kind of narrative we want to tell

262
00:13:45.453 --> 00:13:49.752
about how life works rather than the conventional narrative.

263
00:13:49.763 --> 00:13:51.672
It seems to me that we certainly, it's the

264
00:13:51.682 --> 00:13:53.263
one that we tend to hear about in the

265
00:13:53.273 --> 00:13:56.372
popular sphere, which is that I I it all,

266
00:13:56.382 --> 00:13:59.232
it's all encoded in some sense in our DNA,

267
00:13:59.242 --> 00:14:02.505
in our genome and life. It is simply in

268
00:14:02.515 --> 00:14:05.236
e in essence, it's simply a readout of that

269
00:14:05.245 --> 00:14:08.835
information in the genome. Um So it's a computational

270
00:14:08.846 --> 00:14:13.666
metaphor. And again, you, there is some value for

271
00:14:13.676 --> 00:14:16.825
a computational metaphor of DNA. But if you think

272
00:14:16.835 --> 00:14:19.526
that is going to answer the question of what

273
00:14:19.536 --> 00:14:22.515
life is and how it works, then I'm afraid,

274
00:14:22.526 --> 00:14:23.875
I think you're gonna be mistaken.

275
00:14:24.719 --> 00:14:28.179
So one of the alternatives uh in terms of

276
00:14:28.190 --> 00:14:30.349
the ways we could think about life that you

277
00:14:30.359 --> 00:14:34.619
present in your book is of, of living things

278
00:14:34.630 --> 00:14:39.299
as generators of meaning. What does that mean? Exactly.

279
00:14:40.299 --> 00:14:44.169
Right. That comes again down to this notion that

280
00:14:44.179 --> 00:14:49.039
living things have goals and purposes. Um, AND, you

281
00:14:49.049 --> 00:14:51.250
know, it, it's, it's kind of strange to me

282
00:14:51.260 --> 00:14:54.419
that this should be a controversial thing to, um,

283
00:14:54.429 --> 00:14:56.919
uh, to, to, to, to say because we have

284
00:14:56.929 --> 00:15:00.094
no, I think most people would have no argument

285
00:15:00.104 --> 00:15:02.215
with the fact that we have goals, you know,

286
00:15:02.224 --> 00:15:04.534
that you, that you had a goal in setting

287
00:15:04.544 --> 00:15:07.075
up this, this, this call today, you know, everything

288
00:15:07.085 --> 00:15:09.375
we do, we have some sort of goal that

289
00:15:09.385 --> 00:15:11.965
uh that, that motivates us. We don't always perhaps

290
00:15:11.974 --> 00:15:14.575
quite know or articulate what those are, but we

291
00:15:14.585 --> 00:15:17.049
do and we can see those, we can certainly

292
00:15:17.059 --> 00:15:19.390
see those in other animals. You know, I think

293
00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:21.760
most people would think dogs have some sort of

294
00:15:21.770 --> 00:15:24.549
goal, you know, chimpanzees have some sort of goal.

295
00:15:24.559 --> 00:15:27.900
So it's not unique to us. Um And then

296
00:15:27.909 --> 00:15:30.349
it, it, it doesn't seem a big stretch to

297
00:15:30.359 --> 00:15:33.479
suggest that actually some kind of goal directed us

298
00:15:33.489 --> 00:15:36.025
goes, you know, at least long way, sort of

299
00:15:36.034 --> 00:15:38.234
uh through, I should say rather than down, I

300
00:15:38.244 --> 00:15:41.705
think, but through the uh the living world, um

301
00:15:42.044 --> 00:15:45.155
to, in some sense, some plants have goals. And

302
00:15:45.164 --> 00:15:48.344
actually I think it makes sense to see every

303
00:15:48.354 --> 00:15:51.755
living thing down to single celled bacteria as in

304
00:15:51.765 --> 00:15:55.924
some sense, having goals that they themselves determine in

305
00:15:55.934 --> 00:15:58.364
some sense. That doesn't mean to say that bacteria

306
00:15:58.375 --> 00:16:00.614
thinking, what, what should I do now? Of course,

307
00:16:00.625 --> 00:16:02.835
but there is some goal directed us to it.

308
00:16:03.169 --> 00:16:09.000
So in order to achieve those goals, what uh

309
00:16:09.010 --> 00:16:11.400
what any living system has to do, it is

310
00:16:11.409 --> 00:16:15.179
constantly, it's in some environment, it is constantly bombarded.

311
00:16:15.190 --> 00:16:17.900
If you like with information or with things happening,

312
00:16:17.909 --> 00:16:20.549
things coming from that environment, you know how warm

313
00:16:20.559 --> 00:16:23.419
it is, what molecules are around, what other creatures

314
00:16:23.429 --> 00:16:26.159
are around and so on. You know, living systems

315
00:16:26.169 --> 00:16:30.000
have sensory systems in order to take in that

316
00:16:30.010 --> 00:16:34.530
information. But they don't want to take it all

317
00:16:34.539 --> 00:16:36.830
in, it's too much and most of that information

318
00:16:36.840 --> 00:16:38.960
or a lot of that information is simply not

319
00:16:38.969 --> 00:16:42.309
useful to it. So, you know, for us, I

320
00:16:42.320 --> 00:16:44.849
mean, the for example, the world, you know, is

321
00:16:44.859 --> 00:16:50.150
also saturated with ultraviolet and infrared light that we

322
00:16:50.159 --> 00:16:52.919
got our visual system doesn't register that of some

323
00:16:52.929 --> 00:16:56.030
creatures does, but ours doesn't. So that's information that

324
00:16:56.039 --> 00:16:59.150
if you like evolution has sort of found, you

325
00:16:59.159 --> 00:17:03.280
know, is not sufficiently useful to us to develop

326
00:17:03.289 --> 00:17:05.880
a sensory system to make use of it. So,

327
00:17:05.890 --> 00:17:07.489
you know, we, we ignore it and we don't

328
00:17:07.500 --> 00:17:09.989
even sort of recognize it in daily life, but

329
00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:13.250
it's absolutely out there. So what that really means

330
00:17:13.260 --> 00:17:16.306
is that there is some information out there that

331
00:17:16.316 --> 00:17:19.826
does not have meaning for us. Um It does

332
00:17:19.836 --> 00:17:22.945
not have value for us, value in the sense

333
00:17:22.955 --> 00:17:25.576
of being helpful to us in order to attain

334
00:17:25.586 --> 00:17:28.326
our goals. And this is what uh what, what

335
00:17:28.336 --> 00:17:31.586
nature is constantly doing for every organism. There are,

336
00:17:31.595 --> 00:17:34.576
there are choices being made that essentially have been

337
00:17:34.586 --> 00:17:38.186
made by evolution, what matters in the environment, what

338
00:17:38.196 --> 00:17:40.722
do I have to attain end to and what

339
00:17:40.732 --> 00:17:43.141
can I ignore? And that's really what I mean

340
00:17:43.151 --> 00:17:45.462
by meaning here. So it's not meaning in some,

341
00:17:45.472 --> 00:17:48.212
any sort of deep metaphysical sense of, you know,

342
00:17:48.222 --> 00:17:50.741
what's meaningful in my life. It is, it is

343
00:17:50.751 --> 00:17:55.751
meaning in terms of each organism as an agent,

344
00:17:55.761 --> 00:17:59.582
making, in a sense, making value judgments about the

345
00:17:59.592 --> 00:18:02.472
information it receives this matters and this doesn't, I'll

346
00:18:02.482 --> 00:18:04.621
attend to this and I won't attend to that.

347
00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:09.680
That's really something that um again is quite distinctive

348
00:18:09.689 --> 00:18:13.160
to life because it, it, it really is a

349
00:18:13.170 --> 00:18:15.760
kind of judgment of, you know, what matters and

350
00:18:15.770 --> 00:18:18.229
what doesn't something that it's very hard to see.

351
00:18:18.239 --> 00:18:19.869
How could, you know, you could even have a

352
00:18:19.880 --> 00:18:23.150
sense of that in nonliving systems. So that's what

353
00:18:23.160 --> 00:18:24.819
I mean by meaning. And I suggest in the

354
00:18:24.829 --> 00:18:27.089
book that actually that is one way of thinking

355
00:18:27.099 --> 00:18:30.380
about what life is. Life is a generator of

356
00:18:30.390 --> 00:18:33.760
meaning for the agents, the organisms that are living.

357
00:18:34.119 --> 00:18:37.329
Mhm. Yeah. You know, I guess that some of

358
00:18:37.339 --> 00:18:40.449
the issues that some people might have, perhaps some

359
00:18:40.459 --> 00:18:44.760
of the old school philosophers of biology and evolutionary

360
00:18:44.770 --> 00:18:49.119
biologists with the use of words like meaning and

361
00:18:49.130 --> 00:18:53.459
even perhaps in some contexts, purpose and words like

362
00:18:53.469 --> 00:18:57.180
that is that perhaps the would have a reaction

363
00:18:57.189 --> 00:19:00.040
where they would think. Oh, so now we're getting

364
00:19:00.050 --> 00:19:04.030
into the religious realm or something like that? Are

365
00:19:04.040 --> 00:19:07.420
you saying that we are here for a reason

366
00:19:07.430 --> 00:19:11.739
that we have purposes that are imbued into us

367
00:19:11.910 --> 00:19:15.599
as organisms as living things, stuff like that. And

368
00:19:15.609 --> 00:19:19.540
even sometimes it also gets connected to ideas like

369
00:19:20.130 --> 00:19:24.339
teleology that life follows a particular path, something like

370
00:19:24.349 --> 00:19:27.869
that. So I guess that maybe at least for

371
00:19:27.880 --> 00:19:31.250
the more old school people, that's why they are

372
00:19:31.260 --> 00:19:34.290
a bit, uh, I mean, they don't tend to

373
00:19:34.300 --> 00:19:36.619
like those kinds of words, I guess because they

374
00:19:36.630 --> 00:19:38.339
associate them with that.

375
00:19:38.819 --> 00:19:41.680
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. There is a nervousness. I'd say

376
00:19:41.689 --> 00:19:45.939
an allergy, um, amongst some biologists to words like

377
00:19:45.949 --> 00:19:49.439
that purpose and, and, and certainly to meaning. Um,

378
00:19:49.449 --> 00:19:52.349
AND, and also to goals. I, I was at

379
00:19:52.359 --> 00:19:55.319
a meeting, um, in Minnesota a few weeks ago

380
00:19:55.430 --> 00:19:57.199
that was looking at all of these sorts of

381
00:19:57.209 --> 00:20:00.439
questions about, of agency and purpose and there were

382
00:20:00.510 --> 00:20:02.949
biologists of all sorts of stamps and philosophers of

383
00:20:02.959 --> 00:20:06.209
biology there as well. So regular, you know, biologists

384
00:20:06.219 --> 00:20:10.099
from university departments and, um, some of them were

385
00:20:10.109 --> 00:20:13.270
saying one said in particular, you know, the nice

386
00:20:13.280 --> 00:20:15.589
thing about this, this, uh, a meeting like this

387
00:20:15.599 --> 00:20:17.800
is that we can voice these t, you know,

388
00:20:17.810 --> 00:20:22.199
words that are taboo otherwise they clearly felt, you

389
00:20:22.209 --> 00:20:24.819
know, we need these concepts but we're not allowed

390
00:20:24.829 --> 00:20:26.810
to say them and it kind of seems crazy

391
00:20:26.819 --> 00:20:28.800
that we're not. And so there was a relief

392
00:20:28.810 --> 00:20:31.140
there that you could actually talk in these purposes.

393
00:20:31.229 --> 00:20:32.954
Now, some of that I think is, it is

394
00:20:32.964 --> 00:20:36.755
perfectly understandable because if you talk about things like

395
00:20:36.765 --> 00:20:40.435
purposes, um, and, and, and goals, you know, you

396
00:20:40.444 --> 00:20:44.155
could easily see how that could be weaponized really

397
00:20:44.165 --> 00:20:47.574
by creationists and people, you know, interested in intelligent

398
00:20:47.584 --> 00:20:50.005
design. Say, aha. So where does that purpose come

399
00:20:50.015 --> 00:20:52.094
from? It? You know, must have had some divine

400
00:20:52.104 --> 00:20:55.010
source or whatever, but it really doesn't have to,

401
00:20:55.020 --> 00:20:58.880
you can naturalize these ideas. Um And, you know,

402
00:20:58.890 --> 00:21:01.170
I think that's the, that that's part of the

403
00:21:01.180 --> 00:21:03.050
goal that we, that's certainly part of the goal

404
00:21:03.060 --> 00:21:05.479
of getting a theory of agency which has to

405
00:21:05.489 --> 00:21:09.170
include some notion of goal directed us. So, um

406
00:21:09.180 --> 00:21:11.089
you know, I don't think there has to be

407
00:21:11.099 --> 00:21:14.770
anything at all mystical in, in ideas like that.

408
00:21:14.780 --> 00:21:17.760
And I think it's also important to distinguish you

409
00:21:17.770 --> 00:21:20.500
see, when, when, when uh goals and purpose are,

410
00:21:20.510 --> 00:21:24.219
are talked about often for biologists that seems to

411
00:21:24.229 --> 00:21:29.010
imply that evolution itself has some kind of direction,

412
00:21:29.020 --> 00:21:31.099
some kind of, you know, end point that it's

413
00:21:31.109 --> 00:21:34.079
heading towards, that's been a, you know, an old

414
00:21:34.089 --> 00:21:37.030
idea that has sort of haunted evolutionary theory for

415
00:21:37.040 --> 00:21:40.010
a long, long time. Um And there is as

416
00:21:40.020 --> 00:21:41.469
far as we can tell at the moment, there

417
00:21:41.479 --> 00:21:44.420
is absolutely no reason to believe that evolution has

418
00:21:44.430 --> 00:21:47.030
anything like a goal or a purpose, you know,

419
00:21:47.040 --> 00:21:49.770
that it's famously described as a, this kind of

420
00:21:49.780 --> 00:21:52.949
blind search, you know, that, that, um, I mean,

421
00:21:52.959 --> 00:21:55.040
not really a search for anything, it's a, you

422
00:21:55.050 --> 00:21:57.589
know, a blind process that, that comes up with

423
00:21:57.599 --> 00:22:01.560
all these incredible sort of solutions. Um And, you

424
00:22:01.569 --> 00:22:03.910
know, there are some people who actually do ask

425
00:22:03.920 --> 00:22:07.290
whether there's some directionality to evolution. It's not an

426
00:22:07.300 --> 00:22:10.949
unreasonable question to ask. I'm pretty conservative on that

427
00:22:11.060 --> 00:22:13.449
uh question. I, I feel like, well, you know,

428
00:22:13.459 --> 00:22:15.250
at the moment, I don't see any reason to

429
00:22:15.260 --> 00:22:18.130
suppose that that is the case, but that's quite

430
00:22:18.140 --> 00:22:21.939
a different matter from saying the products of evolution,

431
00:22:21.949 --> 00:22:26.359
individual organisms themselves, not only can have goals and

432
00:22:26.369 --> 00:22:29.459
purposes, but that is in their intrinsic nature, that

433
00:22:29.469 --> 00:22:32.270
is what they are about. So there is no

434
00:22:32.280 --> 00:22:35.180
reason to link the two. You can have blind

435
00:22:35.189 --> 00:22:40.800
evolution producing systems, organisms that are goal driven. And

436
00:22:40.810 --> 00:22:43.510
in fact, I think that's exactly what evolution does.

437
00:22:44.630 --> 00:22:48.010
We'll come back to organisms. But since we're also

438
00:22:48.020 --> 00:22:50.770
going to tackle here, at least to some extent,

439
00:22:50.780 --> 00:22:56.209
questions surrounding units and levels of selection in evolutionary

440
00:22:56.219 --> 00:23:00.040
biology because that's one of the biggest questions out

441
00:23:00.050 --> 00:23:03.520
there. Uh Let me start by asking you now

442
00:23:03.530 --> 00:23:08.400
about perhaps the most basic level that some people

443
00:23:08.410 --> 00:23:10.930
talk about that is the level of the gene.

444
00:23:11.199 --> 00:23:14.640
So when it comes to genes, how do you

445
00:23:14.650 --> 00:23:18.790
think about their role and significance in life? And

446
00:23:18.800 --> 00:23:23.680
do you think that attaching words like instruction book

447
00:23:23.689 --> 00:23:28.829
blueprint or code to them is accurate enough or

448
00:23:28.839 --> 00:23:29.079
not?

449
00:23:29.489 --> 00:23:32.619
Uh Well, II, I think it's not uh accurate.

450
00:23:32.630 --> 00:23:34.829
I think it's actually very misleading. You know, we

451
00:23:34.839 --> 00:23:37.750
still have this notion in sort of popular culture

452
00:23:37.760 --> 00:23:40.939
because it's been pushed by uh by biologists of

453
00:23:40.949 --> 00:23:45.189
various sorts that the genome is our instruction book.

454
00:23:45.199 --> 00:23:48.469
Um Once you start to, to look at how

455
00:23:48.479 --> 00:23:51.349
we actually work and what genes do in that

456
00:23:51.359 --> 00:23:53.800
process, it seems to me that it makes no

457
00:23:53.810 --> 00:23:56.390
sense whatsoever. Not just to me actually to inc

458
00:23:56.400 --> 00:23:58.420
I think to a lot of biologists, it makes

459
00:23:58.430 --> 00:24:00.670
no sense what, so to think about it as

460
00:24:00.680 --> 00:24:02.959
an instruction book, it's not clear what that can

461
00:24:02.969 --> 00:24:05.609
possibly mean. You can't look, you know, an, an

462
00:24:05.619 --> 00:24:07.890
instruction book you can sort of read and you

463
00:24:07.900 --> 00:24:09.810
can understand, OK, that this is how I need

464
00:24:09.819 --> 00:24:12.579
to put this thing together. We, there, there, there

465
00:24:12.589 --> 00:24:15.290
is no indication that we will ever be able

466
00:24:15.300 --> 00:24:18.000
to do anything like that from the genome. Not

467
00:24:18.010 --> 00:24:22.359
least because it's clear that not all the information

468
00:24:22.420 --> 00:24:25.729
that is used in a sense to build uh

469
00:24:25.739 --> 00:24:29.050
that the entire organism is simply in the genome.

470
00:24:29.270 --> 00:24:32.449
Um So I don't think that's a, a helpful

471
00:24:32.459 --> 00:24:34.790
way of, of, of looking at the genome. And

472
00:24:34.800 --> 00:24:37.069
in fact, I think it's, um, it, it, it's

473
00:24:37.079 --> 00:24:40.329
an obstructive way and perhaps a dangerously misleading way

474
00:24:40.339 --> 00:24:42.939
to look at it because it lies at the

475
00:24:42.949 --> 00:24:46.689
root of the cultural idea we have of genetic

476
00:24:46.699 --> 00:24:49.329
determinism that, you know, what we are going to

477
00:24:49.339 --> 00:24:53.042
be is determined by our genes, which I, it,

478
00:24:53.052 --> 00:24:54.792
it, it, you know, there are many, many ways

479
00:24:54.802 --> 00:24:56.772
that you can see that, that simply is not

480
00:24:56.782 --> 00:25:00.262
the case. I mean, to state an obvious one,

481
00:25:00.272 --> 00:25:02.272
the way our brains are wired up with its

482
00:25:02.282 --> 00:25:05.032
uh I think 86 billion neurons or something, there's

483
00:25:05.042 --> 00:25:06.883
lots of them. But the point is there are

484
00:25:06.892 --> 00:25:10.083
more of them and more certainly more connections between

485
00:25:10.093 --> 00:25:13.176
them than there are letters in the genome. There's

486
00:25:13.186 --> 00:25:16.145
not enough information there to specify how that's done.

487
00:25:16.156 --> 00:25:19.196
It can bias those connections in certain ways and

488
00:25:19.206 --> 00:25:23.235
clearly does because there are traits, behavioral traits that

489
00:25:23.245 --> 00:25:25.916
we have, that we can correlate with uh what's

490
00:25:25.926 --> 00:25:28.786
in our genome, but it doesn't program how our

491
00:25:28.796 --> 00:25:30.576
brain is going to wire up. So, you know,

492
00:25:30.586 --> 00:25:34.579
that's just one example. So the way I think

493
00:25:34.589 --> 00:25:36.459
it's more helpful, I mean, uh you know, having

494
00:25:36.469 --> 00:25:39.349
said all that, I think it's absolutely um ie

495
00:25:39.359 --> 00:25:44.270
uh essential to make clear that genes are clearly,

496
00:25:44.280 --> 00:25:47.540
they have a, a hugely central role in how

497
00:25:47.550 --> 00:25:51.589
we work. Um And not least because they are

498
00:25:51.599 --> 00:25:54.300
the thing or at least the genome or the

499
00:25:54.310 --> 00:25:57.530
in information within the genome is the thing that

500
00:25:57.540 --> 00:26:01.614
is passed on between generations. So, Genes, as Richard

501
00:26:01.625 --> 00:26:04.064
Dawkins says, genes, I think really do have a

502
00:26:04.074 --> 00:26:08.555
privileged status in evolutionary theory because they are the

503
00:26:08.564 --> 00:26:12.435
thing that is passed between generations. But that doesn't

504
00:26:12.444 --> 00:26:14.935
mean to say they have to be the thing

505
00:26:14.944 --> 00:26:18.234
that uh contains all the information, you know, that

506
00:26:18.244 --> 00:26:20.675
that is needed to put us together because they're,

507
00:26:20.685 --> 00:26:22.795
what are they passed on between, they're passed on

508
00:26:22.805 --> 00:26:26.339
between things that are already alive. They are, you

509
00:26:26.349 --> 00:26:28.239
know, so that they are not, it, it, it's

510
00:26:28.250 --> 00:26:30.119
a little bit like, you know, we, we tend

511
00:26:30.130 --> 00:26:31.959
to say, well, genes, I mean, in fact, uh

512
00:26:31.969 --> 00:26:34.699
Crick and Watson, when they discovered the structure of

513
00:26:34.709 --> 00:26:38.339
DNA in 1953 you know, Jim Watson at least

514
00:26:38.349 --> 00:26:41.219
alleged that they were convinced that this was the

515
00:26:41.229 --> 00:26:43.560
secret of life, this was what life was all

516
00:26:43.569 --> 00:26:46.599
about. Um And yet, you know, that gives rise

517
00:26:46.609 --> 00:26:50.750
to this peculiar notion that um a living system

518
00:26:50.810 --> 00:26:55.089
plus its genes. It is somehow and it's, you

519
00:26:55.099 --> 00:26:57.300
know, a, a living, it's still a living system.

520
00:26:57.310 --> 00:26:59.579
It has to be alive. The gene does, the

521
00:26:59.589 --> 00:27:02.140
genome does nothing by itself. Put DNA in a

522
00:27:02.150 --> 00:27:04.650
beaker, even if you throw all the uh you

523
00:27:04.660 --> 00:27:06.760
know, molecules that you think might be needed to

524
00:27:06.770 --> 00:27:08.829
put a mo to put a system together. It

525
00:27:08.839 --> 00:27:12.400
does nothing. It's an inert molecule unless it's in

526
00:27:12.410 --> 00:27:14.699
a living system. And when it's in a living

527
00:27:14.709 --> 00:27:19.550
system, what it then does is provide resources or

528
00:27:19.560 --> 00:27:22.680
the really the information for resources, in particular, the

529
00:27:22.689 --> 00:27:27.829
information for building the proteins, the enzymes that catalyze

530
00:27:27.839 --> 00:27:31.479
our biochemical processes. But actually, we're also finding and

531
00:27:31.489 --> 00:27:32.959
this is one of the key things, you know,

532
00:27:32.969 --> 00:27:34.359
I wanted to bring out in the book. We're

533
00:27:34.369 --> 00:27:37.979
also finding that there's a, an awful lot else

534
00:27:37.989 --> 00:27:42.670
in our genome besides instructions for making proteins. Um

535
00:27:42.680 --> 00:27:45.714
So, you know, parts of, of, of our DNA,

536
00:27:45.724 --> 00:27:48.015
we've sort of really discovered only over the past

537
00:27:48.025 --> 00:27:50.314
20 or 30 years. How much this is true

538
00:27:50.464 --> 00:27:52.714
that there are parts of DNA that don't encode

539
00:27:52.724 --> 00:27:56.724
proteins, but they do encode these RN A molecules

540
00:27:56.734 --> 00:27:59.834
that uh are like DNA, but they're, they're just

541
00:27:59.844 --> 00:28:02.954
sort of shorter molecules, they're templated on DNA and

542
00:28:02.964 --> 00:28:05.275
they used to be thought of pretty much all

543
00:28:05.285 --> 00:28:08.520
as being um just the messenger that carries the

544
00:28:08.530 --> 00:28:11.530
information for making a protein from the DNA to

545
00:28:11.540 --> 00:28:13.400
the place to the sort of machinery. And I'm

546
00:28:13.410 --> 00:28:15.989
gonna use that term here that um that, that

547
00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:19.280
makes the proteins, but some RN A molecules aren't

548
00:28:19.290 --> 00:28:21.989
like that. They're called non coding RN A molecules

549
00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:24.430
and they do things in their own, right. They

550
00:28:24.439 --> 00:28:26.880
do kind of protein like jobs if, if you

551
00:28:26.890 --> 00:28:28.959
like. So there's, you know, there's more to the

552
00:28:28.969 --> 00:28:32.275
genome than, than protein coding genes. In fact, there

553
00:28:32.285 --> 00:28:35.324
are also bits of the genome that don't encode

554
00:28:35.334 --> 00:28:38.844
proteins, but that are uh somehow involved in switching

555
00:28:38.854 --> 00:28:41.324
genes on. And off and they're dotted all over

556
00:28:41.334 --> 00:28:44.584
the, the, the genome. So the structure and, and

557
00:28:44.594 --> 00:28:46.954
the information that's in the genome is far more

558
00:28:46.964 --> 00:28:51.574
complex than just being a repository for protein coding

559
00:28:51.584 --> 00:28:53.885
genes. Plus a load of stuff that, you know,

560
00:28:53.895 --> 00:28:57.060
doesn't really do anything useful at all. And the,

561
00:28:57.150 --> 00:29:00.369
the uh the key point really is that the

562
00:29:00.380 --> 00:29:04.609
way all that information is used is contextual what

563
00:29:04.619 --> 00:29:07.680
the cell does with. It depends on all sorts

564
00:29:07.689 --> 00:29:09.689
of things like what kind of cell it is.

565
00:29:09.819 --> 00:29:13.609
The way my liver cells use the information in

566
00:29:13.619 --> 00:29:16.349
my DNA is different from the way my skin

567
00:29:16.359 --> 00:29:18.969
cells do, even though it's the same DNA. So

568
00:29:18.979 --> 00:29:22.536
it's contextual. So the cell is integrated information from

569
00:29:22.546 --> 00:29:25.865
outside, even to the extent of deciding if you

570
00:29:25.875 --> 00:29:29.666
like which protein to make from a particular gene.

571
00:29:29.676 --> 00:29:33.276
Because each g protein coding gene doesn't just encode

572
00:29:33.286 --> 00:29:36.026
one protein, it can encode several. And in fact,

573
00:29:36.036 --> 00:29:39.196
on average, it encodes six different ones because the

574
00:29:39.206 --> 00:29:42.105
information there can be sort of taken apart and

575
00:29:42.115 --> 00:29:45.026
stitched together in different ways to make different proteins.

576
00:29:45.036 --> 00:29:47.852
And the cell if you like decides which of

577
00:29:47.862 --> 00:29:51.401
those to make in a particular circumstance. So that's

578
00:29:51.411 --> 00:29:54.881
information coming from outside, even at the level of

579
00:29:54.891 --> 00:29:57.151
reading out a gene which we thought was pretty

580
00:29:57.161 --> 00:29:59.952
sort of autonomous. So that's really what I mean,

581
00:29:59.962 --> 00:30:03.251
that it's really the, the uh our, our genes

582
00:30:03.261 --> 00:30:06.682
and our DNA generally provide the uh uh a

583
00:30:06.692 --> 00:30:10.521
very rich resource that the cell decides what it's

584
00:30:10.531 --> 00:30:12.312
going to, to use for.

585
00:30:12.739 --> 00:30:15.180
Mhm uh And the fact that you mentioned at

586
00:30:15.189 --> 00:30:18.930
a certain point there, that genes or DNA material

587
00:30:18.939 --> 00:30:21.599
just by itself is inert and it needs to

588
00:30:21.609 --> 00:30:24.810
be integrated into a living system to really be

589
00:30:24.819 --> 00:30:28.560
able to do anything. Uh You mentioned there, for

590
00:30:28.569 --> 00:30:33.430
example, how uh genes in, in that are part

591
00:30:33.439 --> 00:30:36.579
of cells in different kinds of tissues or organs.

592
00:30:36.589 --> 00:30:41.670
For example, uh their genes are expressed differently or

593
00:30:41.680 --> 00:30:45.859
produce different proteins depending on the type of tissue

594
00:30:45.869 --> 00:30:48.300
or organ they are part of. So I I

595
00:30:48.310 --> 00:30:51.770
mean, I guess that we have to look across

596
00:30:51.780 --> 00:30:57.209
different scales here to really understand what do because

597
00:30:57.219 --> 00:30:59.500
it's the fact that they are part of a

598
00:30:59.510 --> 00:31:04.180
particular cell that has particular organelles and is receiving

599
00:31:04.189 --> 00:31:07.920
particular kinds of information from the cells around it

600
00:31:07.930 --> 00:31:10.400
and from different parts of the body. But also

601
00:31:10.410 --> 00:31:13.040
that it is part of a specific kind of

602
00:31:13.050 --> 00:31:16.359
tissue in a specific kind of organ. And also

603
00:31:16.449 --> 00:31:20.290
more generally that it is inside an organism that

604
00:31:20.300 --> 00:31:24.219
lives in a particular kind of environment, right? All

605
00:31:24.229 --> 00:31:25.239
of that matters.

606
00:31:25.339 --> 00:31:29.829
Absolutely. So there is no privilege level in that,

607
00:31:30.040 --> 00:31:33.359
in that system at which, you know, essentially life

608
00:31:33.369 --> 00:31:36.310
is happening. And you know, it's certainly not at

609
00:31:36.319 --> 00:31:38.239
the level of the gene. I mean, this is

610
00:31:38.250 --> 00:31:40.160
the the key thing to get across. I think,

611
00:31:40.170 --> 00:31:42.800
you know, genes are the genes are not alive.

612
00:31:42.810 --> 00:31:44.800
By the time you've, if you want to understand

613
00:31:44.810 --> 00:31:47.760
how life works, you absolutely have to, you know,

614
00:31:47.770 --> 00:31:49.439
get down to the level of the gene to

615
00:31:49.449 --> 00:31:51.640
understand an aspect of that problem, but you're not

616
00:31:51.650 --> 00:31:54.439
gonna answer it there because there is nothing alive

617
00:31:54.579 --> 00:31:59.170
at that level. And what really struck me as

618
00:31:59.180 --> 00:32:01.040
I was, you know, trying to find a way

619
00:32:01.050 --> 00:32:04.900
of, of articulating, this is the, the difference between

620
00:32:04.910 --> 00:32:08.280
that picture, which is really a picture about developmental

621
00:32:08.290 --> 00:32:11.750
biology. And you know, how our uh uh day

622
00:32:11.760 --> 00:32:15.359
to day living works, the the difference between that

623
00:32:15.369 --> 00:32:18.959
and the evolutionary picture. And in fact, there are

624
00:32:18.969 --> 00:32:21.359
plenty of people who feel that what we mean

625
00:32:21.369 --> 00:32:24.530
by gene is different. If we're talking about a

626
00:32:24.550 --> 00:32:28.520
bit of DNA that does something in developmental terms.

627
00:32:28.530 --> 00:32:31.839
And if we're talking about this thing that, you

628
00:32:31.849 --> 00:32:35.099
know, uh in conventional evolutionary theory that people like

629
00:32:35.109 --> 00:32:38.390
Richard Dawkins have fantastically explained, gets passed on between

630
00:32:38.400 --> 00:32:41.349
generations. They're not obviously the same thing. There is

631
00:32:41.359 --> 00:32:43.410
actually just as with life, as you say, there

632
00:32:43.420 --> 00:32:47.449
is no consensus uh definition of, of what a

633
00:32:47.459 --> 00:32:50.619
gene actually is. But all of these different ideas

634
00:32:50.630 --> 00:32:53.319
are useful. And it really struck me that in,

635
00:32:53.329 --> 00:32:56.319
in the view, certainly the view, you know, famously

636
00:32:56.329 --> 00:33:00.400
uh popularized brilliantly popularized by Richard Dawkins of, you

637
00:33:00.410 --> 00:33:04.180
know, um the gene centered view of evolution, he,

638
00:33:04.189 --> 00:33:08.160
he requires genes to be essentially like little agents

639
00:33:08.170 --> 00:33:11.869
themselves, all competing amongst each other in a kind

640
00:33:11.880 --> 00:33:15.489
of pool, undifferentiated pool of agents where, you know,

641
00:33:15.500 --> 00:33:17.880
you don't really, you lose sight of the fact

642
00:33:17.890 --> 00:33:20.410
that there are actually organisms uh here. And you

643
00:33:20.420 --> 00:33:22.959
mean, you literally do. So it, the end uh

644
00:33:22.969 --> 00:33:26.410
Richard Dawkins talks about the a paradox of the

645
00:33:26.420 --> 00:33:28.560
fact that they are organisms at all because you've,

646
00:33:28.569 --> 00:33:29.910
you know, why do you need them if all

647
00:33:29.920 --> 00:33:32.719
these genes are, are themselves little agents, sort of

648
00:33:32.729 --> 00:33:36.800
like little organisms competing and doing stuff. So that

649
00:33:36.810 --> 00:33:40.339
view requires us to put all the agency that

650
00:33:40.349 --> 00:33:43.459
is actually in living systems into the genes themselves.

651
00:33:43.530 --> 00:33:46.359
And, you know, then the the organisms themselves just

652
00:33:46.369 --> 00:33:49.790
become kind of passive vehicles that the genes build

653
00:33:49.800 --> 00:33:52.520
in or for their own purposes. So that's a

654
00:33:52.530 --> 00:33:56.219
view that it can be useful for thinking about

655
00:33:56.229 --> 00:34:00.530
evolutionary biology. But is I think profoundly misleading in

656
00:34:00.540 --> 00:34:03.510
terms of thinking about what genes actually are as

657
00:34:03.520 --> 00:34:07.239
material things that contribute to, you know, how cells

658
00:34:07.250 --> 00:34:11.330
and how organisms and tissues work. So that's that,

659
00:34:11.340 --> 00:34:14.129
that's really um the distinction I'd want to make.

660
00:34:14.139 --> 00:34:17.370
And as you say, you know, what a gene

661
00:34:17.379 --> 00:34:22.770
really? Mm does and means um is contextual. It's

662
00:34:22.780 --> 00:34:26.168
using all this other information that's coming from, from

663
00:34:26.179 --> 00:34:29.310
elsewhere. And you know, that's the only way it

664
00:34:29.320 --> 00:34:32.438
can work. It's not entirely a sort of bottom

665
00:34:32.449 --> 00:34:35.370
up process of simply reading out the genome in

666
00:34:35.379 --> 00:34:38.429
order to build the organism. It's the organism is

667
00:34:38.438 --> 00:34:42.080
constantly integrating all sorts of information. And one of

668
00:34:42.090 --> 00:34:45.520
the things that I found most fascinating in researching

669
00:34:45.530 --> 00:34:49.639
this book is how that integration of information happens.

670
00:34:49.649 --> 00:34:53.590
Even at the level of deciding whether to express

671
00:34:53.600 --> 00:34:56.020
that is whether to convert a gene, a given

672
00:34:56.030 --> 00:34:59.909
gene to its protein or not. It integrates all

673
00:34:59.919 --> 00:35:02.530
sorts of information. Uh YOU know, just to come

674
00:35:02.540 --> 00:35:04.629
up with in the end, a binary decision, should

675
00:35:04.639 --> 00:35:07.189
I um turn this gene on or off basically,

676
00:35:07.199 --> 00:35:10.489
should I express it or not? And uh um

677
00:35:10.500 --> 00:35:13.219
you know, that's that it's a complex decision that

678
00:35:13.229 --> 00:35:17.040
involves many different molecules and actually often many different

679
00:35:17.050 --> 00:35:19.350
parts of, of the, of the, of the, of

680
00:35:19.360 --> 00:35:22.810
our DNA um of the chromosome in order to

681
00:35:22.820 --> 00:35:25.415
make that decision. So there, there is a very

682
00:35:25.425 --> 00:35:30.764
complex sort of set of principles that our biochemistry

683
00:35:30.774 --> 00:35:33.475
uses our cells use in order to make that

684
00:35:33.485 --> 00:35:36.715
decision. It's not something that is solely determined by

685
00:35:36.725 --> 00:35:39.824
what the gene itself, what the genome itself contains.

686
00:35:40.699 --> 00:35:43.439
A and one very important thing here I think

687
00:35:43.449 --> 00:35:46.719
is that um is the way we tend to

688
00:35:46.729 --> 00:35:50.959
relate genes to traits of a particular organism, right?

689
00:35:50.969 --> 00:35:53.979
Because we tend to have or most people tend

690
00:35:53.989 --> 00:35:58.975
to have this very simplistic idea of. So we

691
00:35:58.985 --> 00:36:02.405
have a gene and it produces a particular trait

692
00:36:02.415 --> 00:36:05.875
or a group of genes that produce a particular

693
00:36:05.885 --> 00:36:10.034
trait. But with this new, more complex but also

694
00:36:10.044 --> 00:36:15.905
more accurate view of how things work actually. Um

695
00:36:16.435 --> 00:36:18.135
IN what ways do you think we need to

696
00:36:18.145 --> 00:36:21.445
reframe the way we think about the relationship between

697
00:36:21.455 --> 00:36:22.774
genes and traits,

698
00:36:23.459 --> 00:36:27.580
uh, quite profoundly? Um, BUT only in the sense

699
00:36:27.590 --> 00:36:32.199
really of making it more explicit in public, um,

700
00:36:32.209 --> 00:36:36.889
what geneticists have pretty much always realized, you know,

701
00:36:36.899 --> 00:36:39.679
because we've known for a long time that for

702
00:36:39.689 --> 00:36:43.820
one thing in general, a particular gene isn't in,

703
00:36:43.969 --> 00:36:46.459
uh, isn't involved in just a single trait. It

704
00:36:46.469 --> 00:36:49.479
often turns out to be involved in many different

705
00:36:49.489 --> 00:36:52.379
aspects of our physiology. And that's one of the

706
00:36:52.389 --> 00:36:55.379
things that makes, you know, investigating genes so complicated.

707
00:36:55.389 --> 00:36:56.729
And in fact, if that was one of the

708
00:36:56.739 --> 00:37:00.719
things that triggered me decades ago to start thinking,

709
00:37:00.729 --> 00:37:02.709
you know, in these terms about whether we've got

710
00:37:02.719 --> 00:37:05.639
the right narrative because I, when I was working

711
00:37:05.649 --> 00:37:07.939
as an editor of Nature in the 19 nineties,

712
00:37:07.949 --> 00:37:11.719
um the biological editors would come to our editorial

713
00:37:11.729 --> 00:37:13.449
meetings and they would say things like, you know,

714
00:37:13.459 --> 00:37:15.739
I've got this paper that there, you know, um

715
00:37:15.750 --> 00:37:19.189
that we're gonna publish that is, um, say, looking

716
00:37:19.199 --> 00:37:21.600
at this particular gene that we thought was involved

717
00:37:21.610 --> 00:37:24.550
in. Uh I, I don't know, pregnancy or something

718
00:37:24.560 --> 00:37:27.010
and it turns out that actually it's involved in

719
00:37:27.020 --> 00:37:31.169
something entirely different as well. And no one really

720
00:37:31.179 --> 00:37:33.530
seemed to have any idea of what this meant,

721
00:37:33.540 --> 00:37:36.449
you know, why genes have all these different um

722
00:37:36.459 --> 00:37:39.540
strings to their bow. And if we take a

723
00:37:39.550 --> 00:37:43.250
particular trait, we don't, we can't in general trace

724
00:37:43.260 --> 00:37:45.659
it back to a single gene. We find that

725
00:37:45.669 --> 00:37:48.340
it's, there are many genes involved and in some

726
00:37:48.350 --> 00:37:50.729
cases, if we look at something like how tall

727
00:37:50.739 --> 00:37:53.479
we are, there's clearly a strong genetic component to

728
00:37:53.489 --> 00:37:57.370
that, but it's spread over hundreds, maybe thousands of

729
00:37:57.379 --> 00:38:00.929
genes. Now, we only have 20,000 protein coding genes

730
00:38:00.939 --> 00:38:04.419
or maybe even slightly fewer in our bodies. So,

731
00:38:04.429 --> 00:38:06.909
you know, if you've got a trait that involves

732
00:38:07.050 --> 00:38:09.699
1000 or a few 1000 genes, kind of uh

733
00:38:09.709 --> 00:38:12.909
most of the, the, the protein coding genome or

734
00:38:12.969 --> 00:38:16.040
sorry, that's a significant proportion of it. And sometimes

735
00:38:16.050 --> 00:38:18.719
it really is most of it. So, II I,

736
00:38:18.729 --> 00:38:21.100
what that seems to be saying is that there

737
00:38:21.110 --> 00:38:24.439
are some traits that are kind of genome wide,

738
00:38:24.449 --> 00:38:27.350
uh you know, they're, they're, they're influenced a, at

739
00:38:27.360 --> 00:38:33.000
a genome wide level. And some, um uh some

740
00:38:33.010 --> 00:38:36.239
researchers are talking now of uh uh a notion

741
00:38:36.250 --> 00:38:39.719
of omni GIC of traits that seem to involve

742
00:38:39.729 --> 00:38:41.489
pretty much all our genes or, you know, a

743
00:38:41.500 --> 00:38:45.145
huge problem portion of them, some being more important

744
00:38:45.155 --> 00:38:48.034
than others. But most uh genes, pretty much all

745
00:38:48.044 --> 00:38:51.385
the genes having only a tiny, tiny, little influence

746
00:38:51.395 --> 00:38:53.955
themselves. You know, in the sense that you see

747
00:38:53.965 --> 00:38:57.284
variations in the trait and variations in the, in

748
00:38:57.294 --> 00:39:00.215
the sequence of that genome. But they account for

749
00:39:00.225 --> 00:39:03.385
hardly any of the, the, the actual variants by

750
00:39:03.395 --> 00:39:06.770
themselves. So, you know, what, what that, that, that's

751
00:39:06.780 --> 00:39:09.100
really what we want to, to, to what we

752
00:39:09.110 --> 00:39:11.770
need to, to get across. And as I say,

753
00:39:11.780 --> 00:39:14.290
that's something that's kind of always been recognized by

754
00:39:14.300 --> 00:39:17.870
geneticists. And yet somehow this kind of notion has

755
00:39:17.879 --> 00:39:21.530
grown up that there is a gene for this

756
00:39:21.540 --> 00:39:22.939
and a gene, you know, a gene for this

757
00:39:22.949 --> 00:39:24.989
trait, a gene for that trait, a gene for,

758
00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:27.790
I don't know, boldness, a gene for, um, you

759
00:39:27.800 --> 00:39:31.875
know, criminality or something. And we saw endless headlines

760
00:39:31.885 --> 00:39:34.104
like this in the 19 nineties and you still

761
00:39:34.114 --> 00:39:36.435
see them now and we seem to love this

762
00:39:36.445 --> 00:39:39.554
story in the media because it's a simple story

763
00:39:39.564 --> 00:39:42.435
to tell. Ah, we found the gene four X.

764
00:39:42.445 --> 00:39:46.235
Um And you know, iii, I slightly feel that

765
00:39:46.245 --> 00:39:48.554
geneticists now they, they kind of tear their hair

766
00:39:48.564 --> 00:39:50.655
out every time, you know, one of these stories

767
00:39:50.665 --> 00:39:52.604
comes up because they know that's not the real

768
00:39:52.614 --> 00:39:55.594
picture. And yet there seems to be a reluctance

769
00:39:56.149 --> 00:39:58.610
uh uh in the community to ask. Well, why

770
00:39:58.620 --> 00:40:00.790
did, why do we have this picture then? Who

771
00:40:00.800 --> 00:40:03.770
is it that has allowed this picture to develop?

772
00:40:03.870 --> 00:40:07.250
And I do think that geneticist and genetics generally

773
00:40:07.260 --> 00:40:09.810
uh is, is at least partly culpable for the

774
00:40:09.820 --> 00:40:13.209
fact that we have got that simplistic picture. So,

775
00:40:13.219 --> 00:40:15.209
you know, we need a different story to tell.

776
00:40:15.219 --> 00:40:18.290
And I think that uh once we recognize that

777
00:40:18.300 --> 00:40:21.929
genes are resources that cells use for doing various

778
00:40:21.939 --> 00:40:24.739
things and resources that can do many different things.

779
00:40:24.959 --> 00:40:27.189
Um YOU know, that are very, that are useful

780
00:40:27.199 --> 00:40:30.090
in many different ways. That is a better way

781
00:40:30.100 --> 00:40:33.290
to understand genes. So there are, for example, genes

782
00:40:33.300 --> 00:40:37.429
involved in our development, um, that just keep turning

783
00:40:37.439 --> 00:40:40.045
up again and again in, you know, a gene

784
00:40:40.055 --> 00:40:42.716
that is involved in the development of our fingers

785
00:40:42.726 --> 00:40:45.105
might turn up in also the development of our

786
00:40:45.115 --> 00:40:47.395
lungs or, or, you know, something like this. There's

787
00:40:47.406 --> 00:40:51.395
a relatively small set of key developmental genes that

788
00:40:51.406 --> 00:40:54.156
seem to kind of somehow between themselves, do all

789
00:40:54.166 --> 00:40:57.746
seemingly almost everything in development. So, you know, they're,

790
00:40:57.756 --> 00:41:00.466
they're not genes for making a heart or making

791
00:41:00.476 --> 00:41:03.835
a lung or whatever, they're genes gen general purpose

792
00:41:03.845 --> 00:41:07.751
develop mental genes that our cells and our tissues

793
00:41:07.761 --> 00:41:10.602
are able to make use of in different contexts

794
00:41:10.612 --> 00:41:13.431
to do different jobs. So I think that it's

795
00:41:13.441 --> 00:41:15.872
a, it's a harder story to tell about what

796
00:41:15.882 --> 00:41:18.031
genes are. You know, I if we think of

797
00:41:18.041 --> 00:41:20.211
it this way, but that's why I think this

798
00:41:20.221 --> 00:41:23.612
notion of resources that are used by a higher

799
00:41:23.622 --> 00:41:26.761
level of the biological hierarchy that is a more

800
00:41:26.771 --> 00:41:29.241
accurate picture of what they do.

801
00:41:29.531 --> 00:41:32.610
Mhm And o of course, we don't have time

802
00:41:32.620 --> 00:41:34.949
to get into all the details here, but people

803
00:41:34.959 --> 00:41:37.020
of course can read your book and learn more

804
00:41:37.030 --> 00:41:40.070
about it. But the ways by which, as we

805
00:41:40.080 --> 00:41:43.620
said earlier, the same gene can produce different pro

806
00:41:43.899 --> 00:41:47.830
proteins in different contexts. I mean, people also have

807
00:41:47.840 --> 00:41:52.050
to understand that first of all genes in different

808
00:41:52.060 --> 00:41:56.209
kinds of cells can be active or silent and

809
00:41:56.219 --> 00:41:59.560
then they have to be transcribed. We have to

810
00:41:59.770 --> 00:42:03.540
description and they are transcribed into MRN A or

811
00:42:03.550 --> 00:42:08.669
messenger RN A. And then after that, uh there's

812
00:42:08.679 --> 00:42:14.250
pro post transcription processes that can alter that MRN

813
00:42:14.260 --> 00:42:19.469
A before it goes into the ribosome to then

814
00:42:19.479 --> 00:42:23.030
uh uh I mean, get match to a particular

815
00:42:23.040 --> 00:42:27.090
kind of TRN A and then produce the protein.

816
00:42:27.100 --> 00:42:30.679
So, I mean, it's not that we have, we

817
00:42:30.689 --> 00:42:34.520
have a particular gene that gets transcribed and it

818
00:42:34.530 --> 00:42:39.199
goes directly connected to a particular kind of protein

819
00:42:39.209 --> 00:42:40.840
produced in the ribosome.

820
00:42:41.120 --> 00:42:43.350
No, no. Well, that's right. That's um you know,

821
00:42:43.360 --> 00:42:45.340
as I mentioned that uh you know, a single

822
00:42:45.350 --> 00:42:48.800
gene in general can make several different proteins depending

823
00:42:48.810 --> 00:42:51.159
on the context and the way that happens um

824
00:42:51.169 --> 00:42:53.479
is that, and this was discovered in the 19

825
00:42:53.489 --> 00:42:55.909
seventies and it was a total, it came out

826
00:42:55.919 --> 00:42:57.800
of nowhere and people were astonished by it to

827
00:42:57.810 --> 00:43:01.959
begin with that. Um The sequence of uh sort

828
00:43:01.969 --> 00:43:04.790
of chemical letters in DNA is not the same

829
00:43:04.800 --> 00:43:08.379
as the sequence of uh chemical letters in proteins

830
00:43:08.389 --> 00:43:11.760
that actually there are parts missing. Um And uh

831
00:43:11.770 --> 00:43:14.820
people realize that what happens is that the, that

832
00:43:14.830 --> 00:43:17.479
the, so the DNA gets transcribed into the uh

833
00:43:17.489 --> 00:43:20.000
M and the messenger RN A molecule. And then

834
00:43:20.010 --> 00:43:24.179
there's this big sort of assembly of molecules, um

835
00:43:24.330 --> 00:43:26.840
not just proteins, but actually, also some of these

836
00:43:26.850 --> 00:43:29.550
non coding RNAs um that comes along called the

837
00:43:29.560 --> 00:43:33.050
splica zom, which takes the MRN A cuts it

838
00:43:33.060 --> 00:43:37.610
up, throws away some bits um called introns stitches

839
00:43:37.620 --> 00:43:40.889
together in various ways, the, the other bits called

840
00:43:40.899 --> 00:43:43.810
exons. And that makes the template on which the

841
00:43:43.820 --> 00:43:46.909
protein is made. And so splica Zoe is really,

842
00:43:46.919 --> 00:43:49.885
if you like making the choice which protein you're

843
00:43:49.895 --> 00:43:53.264
gonna make from a given MRN A, you know,

844
00:43:53.274 --> 00:43:55.844
the, the the primary sort of transcript in, in

845
00:43:55.854 --> 00:43:58.215
terms of how it stitches it together. And again,

846
00:43:58.225 --> 00:44:02.014
that is contextual information. So it's you, it's integrating

847
00:44:02.024 --> 00:44:05.594
information, you know, of all sorts by bringing together

848
00:44:05.604 --> 00:44:09.524
all these different molecules, these proteins and um uh

849
00:44:09.534 --> 00:44:13.044
and, and R and uh non coding RNAs and

850
00:44:13.054 --> 00:44:16.679
somehow out of that comes this decision. Um So

851
00:44:16.689 --> 00:44:19.419
the more we've understood about that process, how the

852
00:44:19.429 --> 00:44:23.199
splicer zone works, you know, that's uh an aspect

853
00:44:23.209 --> 00:44:27.959
of this contextual um A and Yyy, you know,

854
00:44:27.969 --> 00:44:31.389
that's just one sort of aspect I guess of,

855
00:44:31.399 --> 00:44:34.949
you know, how the DH how the even the

856
00:44:34.959 --> 00:44:37.120
at the level of the individual molecules that get

857
00:44:37.129 --> 00:44:40.639
made in our bodies, you know, how that involves

858
00:44:40.649 --> 00:44:45.229
higher level information. So really what this is um

859
00:44:45.800 --> 00:44:49.810
uh liw you could say, challenging is, it's certainly

860
00:44:49.820 --> 00:44:53.330
challenging. The conventional idea that information flow in biology

861
00:44:53.340 --> 00:44:55.260
is all bottom up from the gene to the

862
00:44:55.270 --> 00:44:59.060
proteins and then somehow sort of magically the proteins,

863
00:44:59.070 --> 00:45:00.860
you know, all the information in the proteins sort

864
00:45:00.870 --> 00:45:04.010
of puts together us. Um It's challenging that it's

865
00:45:04.020 --> 00:45:07.300
saying that information flow is coming in in all

866
00:45:07.310 --> 00:45:11.383
different directions. And that idea that that old idea

867
00:45:11.433 --> 00:45:14.312
is often um sort of thought about in terms

868
00:45:14.322 --> 00:45:17.103
of what Francis Crick called the central dogma of

869
00:45:17.113 --> 00:45:21.393
DNA. And his, um I, I idea was, you

870
00:45:21.403 --> 00:45:23.742
know, it, it was, he was talking about how

871
00:45:23.752 --> 00:45:27.903
information gets from DNA to RN A to proteins.

872
00:45:27.913 --> 00:45:30.075
And, but in a sense, he, it it in

873
00:45:30.085 --> 00:45:32.775
a nutshell, he was saying once the information has

874
00:45:32.785 --> 00:45:35.956
got to the protein, it's, it doesn't get back,

875
00:45:35.966 --> 00:45:39.025
there isn't a backward information flow from proteins to

876
00:45:39.035 --> 00:45:41.946
DNA. You don't get, you know, the protein doesn't

877
00:45:41.956 --> 00:45:44.506
sort of change the nature of, uh, the DNA

878
00:45:44.516 --> 00:45:47.775
itself. So in that sense, it's one dir directional.

879
00:45:47.785 --> 00:45:50.466
Even though within that flow, there can be a

880
00:45:50.476 --> 00:45:53.820
little more complexity than that, that actually, you know,

881
00:45:53.830 --> 00:45:56.540
I think that, that I, if it's carefully stated,

882
00:45:56.550 --> 00:46:00.070
that's a pretty good summary of what actually happens

883
00:46:00.080 --> 00:46:02.360
at that level. There are some people who say,

884
00:46:02.370 --> 00:46:04.949
you know, that there are sort of particular processes

885
00:46:04.959 --> 00:46:07.729
that might challenge that idea. But on the whole,

886
00:46:07.739 --> 00:46:10.959
I think it's AAA fair summary of what happens

887
00:46:10.969 --> 00:46:15.830
between deer DNA and proteins. Um But, uh, as

888
00:46:15.840 --> 00:46:17.899
I say, it, it, the, the fact that the

889
00:46:17.909 --> 00:46:21.070
protein, you know, it is not uniquely determined by

890
00:46:21.080 --> 00:46:23.709
the DNA means that there is actually more information

891
00:46:23.719 --> 00:46:26.040
coming in, it doesn't necessarily get back to DNA,

892
00:46:26.050 --> 00:46:28.760
but it's coming in at different levels of that,

893
00:46:28.770 --> 00:46:32.860
that, uh, that, that, that process and certainly what

894
00:46:32.870 --> 00:46:36.679
it doesn't mean is that this somehow extends to

895
00:46:36.689 --> 00:46:39.610
the whole organism that actually, and this is really

896
00:46:39.620 --> 00:46:42.909
what I think Crick maybe to some extent had

897
00:46:42.919 --> 00:46:45.449
in mind and definitely what James Watson had in

898
00:46:45.459 --> 00:46:49.610
mind when he kind of misstated, uh, repeatedly. Crick's

899
00:46:49.620 --> 00:46:53.010
central dogma. Really. I think wanting to get the

900
00:46:53.020 --> 00:46:56.745
idea across that it's that information flow is all

901
00:46:56.754 --> 00:46:59.294
from the gene up to the organism. And it

902
00:46:59.304 --> 00:47:02.965
is this simple readout process. That's the message that

903
00:47:02.975 --> 00:47:05.104
has tended to sort of come across. And that's

904
00:47:05.114 --> 00:47:07.504
the one that I think is no longer tenable,

905
00:47:07.514 --> 00:47:10.485
given what molecular biology has told us over the

906
00:47:10.495 --> 00:47:11.804
past several decades.

907
00:47:12.149 --> 00:47:16.479
Mhm. Uh And talking about proteins, uh how important

908
00:47:16.489 --> 00:47:19.590
are proteins in life? I mean, because they seem

909
00:47:19.600 --> 00:47:23.729
to be everywhere and seem to participate in, in

910
00:47:23.739 --> 00:47:27.780
every single kind of different function out there. So

911
00:47:27.790 --> 00:47:29.209
how important are they?

912
00:47:29.479 --> 00:47:33.219
Well, uh utterly crucial. I mean, they're, they're extraordinary

913
00:47:33.229 --> 00:47:36.659
molecules. Um So I said that most proteins are

914
00:47:36.669 --> 00:47:39.929
uh are, are enzymes of some sort. So basically

915
00:47:39.939 --> 00:47:42.939
they're proteins are, are strings of amino acids joined

916
00:47:42.949 --> 00:47:45.989
together like beads on a necklace really. And then

917
00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:49.830
in general, the proteins will crumple up in water

918
00:47:49.840 --> 00:47:51.790
into a part in the water of the cell

919
00:47:51.800 --> 00:47:55.312
into a particular shape, a compact shape. Um And

920
00:47:55.322 --> 00:47:58.343
that does its job. Um So the shape that

921
00:47:58.353 --> 00:48:01.433
it forms um in a, in a sense that

922
00:48:01.443 --> 00:48:04.752
determines what the enzyme does. And the traditional idea

923
00:48:04.762 --> 00:48:07.423
was that within that shape, there's uh a AAA

924
00:48:07.433 --> 00:48:11.752
little sort of binding pocket uh with a particular

925
00:48:11.762 --> 00:48:14.673
geometry that fits the molecule that the enzyme is

926
00:48:14.683 --> 00:48:16.673
meant to act on like a lock and key.

927
00:48:16.702 --> 00:48:20.502
And that's really the, the root of the specificity

928
00:48:20.512 --> 00:48:22.656
that proteins have. So our cells are full of

929
00:48:22.666 --> 00:48:25.645
all these different proteins, thousands of different proteins. But

930
00:48:25.656 --> 00:48:28.775
because they have these very particular shapes, they only

931
00:48:28.785 --> 00:48:32.696
recognize their given target and kind of ignore everything

932
00:48:32.706 --> 00:48:36.476
else. That was the traditional idea really. Um One

933
00:48:36.486 --> 00:48:38.325
of the things that I talk about in my

934
00:48:38.335 --> 00:48:40.746
book in relation to proteins, I mean, I should

935
00:48:40.756 --> 00:48:42.875
say that actually, you know what, what I found

936
00:48:42.885 --> 00:48:45.226
was that in looking at all these different levels

937
00:48:45.236 --> 00:48:48.389
of how life works. Uh Pretty much in every

938
00:48:48.399 --> 00:48:52.439
case over the past several decades, we've discovered something

939
00:48:52.449 --> 00:48:55.610
that significantly changes that picture. And one of the

940
00:48:55.620 --> 00:48:59.300
things that does so for proteins is that that

941
00:48:59.310 --> 00:49:01.520
nice, neat idea of this sort of lock and

942
00:49:01.530 --> 00:49:04.419
key idea doesn't seem in general to be the

943
00:49:04.429 --> 00:49:08.239
case that our protein, many of our proteins, perhaps

944
00:49:08.250 --> 00:49:11.610
uh a third, perhaps half, perhaps more don't have

945
00:49:11.620 --> 00:49:15.689
these really, you know, tightly well defined geometric shapes.

946
00:49:15.889 --> 00:49:19.010
They're actually floppy to some degree, they have what

947
00:49:19.020 --> 00:49:22.479
biochemists call disorder. And some of our proteins have

948
00:49:22.489 --> 00:49:24.580
a lot of it. They're really floppy so they're

949
00:49:24.590 --> 00:49:28.110
not like tightly folded, um compact things. They, they've

950
00:49:28.120 --> 00:49:31.219
got all this kind of floppiness and that is

951
00:49:31.229 --> 00:49:34.169
something that protein disorder is something that seems to

952
00:49:34.179 --> 00:49:35.729
be crucial to the way a lot of those

953
00:49:35.739 --> 00:49:39.459
proteins work. One thing it does, it is if

954
00:49:39.469 --> 00:49:41.959
it has this floppiness, then it's no longer. So

955
00:49:41.969 --> 00:49:44.879
particular about which molecules it binds to, it gives

956
00:49:44.889 --> 00:49:48.219
the proteins a kind of fairly generic stickiness and

957
00:49:48.229 --> 00:49:51.080
allow different proteins to stick together. And what it

958
00:49:51.090 --> 00:49:54.830
means is that different proteins can then find novel

959
00:49:54.840 --> 00:49:59.376
parts to stick to. And in that way, they

960
00:49:59.386 --> 00:50:02.997
can um th they, they can perhaps unite two

961
00:50:03.007 --> 00:50:07.416
completely different molecular pathways that you know, responsible or

962
00:50:07.427 --> 00:50:11.166
that are implicated in different processes. And that is

963
00:50:11.177 --> 00:50:13.527
probably one of the things that lies at the

964
00:50:13.537 --> 00:50:17.977
heart of the this poly functionality that genes have

965
00:50:17.987 --> 00:50:19.556
because it's really, you know, it can be a

966
00:50:19.566 --> 00:50:22.983
poly that the gene products the proteins have because

967
00:50:22.993 --> 00:50:26.674
they stick to members of different sort of pathways

968
00:50:26.684 --> 00:50:29.714
and create crosstalk between them and create all this

969
00:50:29.724 --> 00:50:34.253
complexity in the network of interactions that allows information

970
00:50:34.263 --> 00:50:36.904
to be brought in from different sources. And we

971
00:50:36.914 --> 00:50:40.273
find that many of the most important sort of

972
00:50:40.283 --> 00:50:43.793
hub proteins in, in our, in our own uh

973
00:50:43.803 --> 00:50:46.861
protein sort of networks in our own biochemistry are

974
00:50:46.871 --> 00:50:49.730
often ones that will have a fair degree of

975
00:50:49.740 --> 00:50:54.321
disorder. So they're good connectors between different aspects of

976
00:50:54.331 --> 00:50:57.371
our biochemistry. And this is what makes them so,

977
00:50:57.381 --> 00:51:00.391
you know, crucially important. So some of the proteins,

978
00:51:00.400 --> 00:51:04.260
for example, that seem to be um implicated or

979
00:51:04.270 --> 00:51:07.460
their genes are implicated in cancers seem to be,

980
00:51:07.470 --> 00:51:10.979
you know, of this nature, they're somewhat disordered. So

981
00:51:10.989 --> 00:51:14.649
this uh this this notion of protein disorder is,

982
00:51:14.659 --> 00:51:17.500
you know, it's clearly very important for our biochemistry

983
00:51:17.510 --> 00:51:20.310
and what it introduces. And this is just one

984
00:51:20.320 --> 00:51:22.929
way in which this this concept is introduced. What

985
00:51:22.939 --> 00:51:26.500
it introduces is a kind of fuzziness to our

986
00:51:26.510 --> 00:51:30.580
molecular networks. Instead of being these precise chains of

987
00:51:30.590 --> 00:51:33.500
information transfer from this molecule to this molecule to

988
00:51:33.510 --> 00:51:36.300
this molecule, they're a bit fuzzy because the proteins

989
00:51:36.310 --> 00:51:38.500
themselves are a bit promiscuous in what they stick

990
00:51:38.510 --> 00:51:41.139
to. And it seems that this is actually an

991
00:51:41.149 --> 00:51:44.229
essential part of the way we work because there

992
00:51:44.239 --> 00:51:46.899
is more of this fuzziness in us than there

993
00:51:46.909 --> 00:51:50.010
is in bacteria, which is what we were if

994
00:51:50.020 --> 00:51:53.020
you like descended from. So it seems that evolution

995
00:51:53.030 --> 00:51:55.800
has put it there on purpose, there is a

996
00:51:55.810 --> 00:51:58.300
value to it. And I think that the value,

997
00:51:58.310 --> 00:52:00.969
it seems to me the value of it is

998
00:52:00.979 --> 00:52:04.239
that it allows this kind of contextual this kind

999
00:52:04.250 --> 00:52:07.310
of integration of many sources of information that is

1000
00:52:07.320 --> 00:52:11.649
essential for an organism, a complex multicellular organism like

1001
00:52:11.659 --> 00:52:12.060
us.

1002
00:52:12.870 --> 00:52:16.669
And of course, we're talking about genes and proteins.

1003
00:52:16.679 --> 00:52:21.010
But in fact, what uh in the brother picture,

1004
00:52:21.020 --> 00:52:24.330
what we have in an organism are networks, right?

1005
00:52:24.340 --> 00:52:28.459
I mean, the sort of iced sciences like genomics,

1006
00:52:28.469 --> 00:52:34.764
transcriptome proteomics atomics because we have networks of genes,

1007
00:52:34.774 --> 00:52:38.875
networks of transcription factors, networks of proteins. And then

1008
00:52:38.885 --> 00:52:43.405
also networks are trying to understand how different kinds

1009
00:52:43.415 --> 00:52:47.965
of molecules in a particular context interact with one

1010
00:52:47.975 --> 00:52:49.165
another. Right.

1011
00:52:49.489 --> 00:52:51.919
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And you know that too has

1012
00:52:51.929 --> 00:52:54.270
been uh sort of recognized for a long time

1013
00:52:54.280 --> 00:52:56.479
that actually a key part of the answer of

1014
00:52:56.489 --> 00:52:58.510
how we work is to try to understand these

1015
00:52:58.520 --> 00:53:02.169
networks of interaction. But what I wanted to uh

1016
00:53:02.179 --> 00:53:05.149
where I wanted to shift that narrative is that

1017
00:53:05.159 --> 00:53:07.750
in the past, those networks have tended to be

1018
00:53:07.760 --> 00:53:11.100
thought of as a bit like um the the

1019
00:53:11.110 --> 00:53:15.389
wiring circuitry in silicon chips. So there are very

1020
00:53:15.399 --> 00:53:18.459
precise paths, you know, this network has a very

1021
00:53:18.469 --> 00:53:21.050
precise structure and you can sort of see, you

1022
00:53:21.060 --> 00:53:23.429
know, in biochemistry textbooks, you sort of see these

1023
00:53:23.439 --> 00:53:26.899
diagrams of, you know, these complex networks, but each

1024
00:53:26.909 --> 00:53:29.159
molecule kind of speaks to this one or this

1025
00:53:29.169 --> 00:53:31.750
one in very particular ways, what I wanted to

1026
00:53:31.760 --> 00:53:34.469
get across is that those networks have this fuzz.

1027
00:53:35.385 --> 00:53:39.196
And so, you know, I'm not even totally sure

1028
00:53:39.206 --> 00:53:42.736
that network is again the right metaphor for thinking

1029
00:53:42.746 --> 00:53:45.976
about them because um or at least in general

1030
00:53:45.986 --> 00:53:48.696
because, you know, another thing that happens is that,

1031
00:53:48.845 --> 00:53:50.845
and this is something we've only discovered in the

1032
00:53:50.855 --> 00:53:53.976
past sort of 20 years is that cells make

1033
00:53:53.986 --> 00:53:58.865
extensive use of loose collections of, of, of molecules

1034
00:53:58.875 --> 00:54:02.181
rather and very particular sort of pairings, you know,

1035
00:54:02.191 --> 00:54:07.261
in these networks, they bring together clumps of molecules

1036
00:54:07.271 --> 00:54:09.662
of maybe hundreds of different molecules in these sort

1037
00:54:09.672 --> 00:54:13.162
of dense kind of liquid like clusters. Or some

1038
00:54:13.172 --> 00:54:14.592
of them are liquid, like they're sort of like

1039
00:54:14.602 --> 00:54:19.662
gels actually that form in in transient ways in

1040
00:54:19.672 --> 00:54:21.961
our cells. So we we, you know, we started

1041
00:54:21.971 --> 00:54:24.001
to see because we had the techniques to do

1042
00:54:24.011 --> 00:54:27.520
it all these little blobs and sort of speckles

1043
00:54:27.530 --> 00:54:29.570
and things forming in our cells. It looks much

1044
00:54:29.580 --> 00:54:32.530
more messy than we thought it was. And the

1045
00:54:32.540 --> 00:54:34.949
more we understand about those, the more it seems

1046
00:54:34.959 --> 00:54:37.610
that actually this is a mechanism that cells use,

1047
00:54:37.620 --> 00:54:40.290
that's really a physics based mechanism. It's sort of

1048
00:54:40.300 --> 00:54:43.879
analogous to the way um uh vinegar separates from

1049
00:54:43.889 --> 00:54:46.770
oil in salad dressing. It really is like in

1050
00:54:46.780 --> 00:54:49.399
some cases, at least like a kind of liquid

1051
00:54:49.409 --> 00:54:52.340
liquid phase separation, a separation of one liquid phase

1052
00:54:52.350 --> 00:54:55.550
from another. So, you know, it's not some precise

1053
00:54:55.560 --> 00:54:58.379
structure that where the molecules are joined together in

1054
00:54:58.389 --> 00:55:00.870
certain ways, which is what we used to think.

1055
00:55:00.969 --> 00:55:03.520
Um It, it's, it's a loose and I talk

1056
00:55:03.530 --> 00:55:05.850
about it as a sort of committee of molecules

1057
00:55:05.949 --> 00:55:09.310
that are often interacting with many others in, you

1058
00:55:09.320 --> 00:55:12.100
know, in these promiscuous ways and yet out of

1059
00:55:12.110 --> 00:55:13.850
them. And this is what committees are for they

1060
00:55:13.860 --> 00:55:16.639
for making decisions. So out of them comes kind

1061
00:55:16.649 --> 00:55:20.310
some kind of decision. So these structures, they're called

1062
00:55:20.320 --> 00:55:24.629
biomolecular condensates. And they've been implicated in all kinds

1063
00:55:24.639 --> 00:55:27.360
of cell processes, you know, often they're related to

1064
00:55:27.370 --> 00:55:31.139
disease. Um, BUT they're certainly implicated in the way

1065
00:55:31.149 --> 00:55:33.489
genes are regulated, the way they're switched on and

1066
00:55:33.500 --> 00:55:34.969
off. I, you know, I mentioned that there are

1067
00:55:34.979 --> 00:55:38.010
many molecules involved. They seem to be involved by

1068
00:55:38.020 --> 00:55:41.719
forming of these blobs, sort of BB, basically on

1069
00:55:41.729 --> 00:55:46.709
DNA within the cell nucleus that, that through some

1070
00:55:46.719 --> 00:55:50.300
kind of molecular, you know, committee decides whether to

1071
00:55:50.310 --> 00:55:52.610
turn the gene on or off. So if there

1072
00:55:52.620 --> 00:55:56.469
are networks, often they're much more, they're these fuzzy

1073
00:55:56.479 --> 00:56:01.239
kind of blobby promiscuous networks rather than wiring diagrams.

1074
00:56:01.790 --> 00:56:05.360
Mhm. So, I guess that now is a good

1075
00:56:05.370 --> 00:56:09.449
time since we've already talked about genes and proteins

1076
00:56:09.459 --> 00:56:13.090
to move one level up and talk about the

1077
00:56:13.100 --> 00:56:16.159
cell. So, uh how do you look at the

1078
00:56:16.169 --> 00:56:20.979
cell in the broader context of an organism? And

1079
00:56:20.989 --> 00:56:22.250
in evolution?

1080
00:56:22.629 --> 00:56:25.080
Well, II, I think there's been um well, I

1081
00:56:25.090 --> 00:56:29.300
know that there has been an increasing voice in

1082
00:56:29.310 --> 00:56:34.179
biology, I think over the past 20 years to

1083
00:56:34.189 --> 00:56:37.679
sort of reinstate the cell at the center of

1084
00:56:37.689 --> 00:56:39.959
it. Um Some people have even talked about the

1085
00:56:39.969 --> 00:56:42.250
rediscovery of the cell, you know, nine, since the

1086
00:56:42.260 --> 00:56:45.290
19 fifties, it was all about the gene. And

1087
00:56:45.300 --> 00:56:49.860
I think since ironically or perhaps actually not coincidentally

1088
00:56:49.870 --> 00:56:52.270
since the completion of the human genome project, uh

1089
00:56:52.280 --> 00:56:55.919
around the turn of the millennium, the cell has,

1090
00:56:55.929 --> 00:56:58.750
you know, been se sort of returned to center

1091
00:56:58.760 --> 00:57:01.659
stage. And I think, you know, that is totally

1092
00:57:01.669 --> 00:57:05.479
appropriate because the cell is the minimal living thing

1093
00:57:05.510 --> 00:57:08.479
below the level of the cell. Obviously, there are,

1094
00:57:08.489 --> 00:57:10.870
you know, things crucial things happening that we need

1095
00:57:10.879 --> 00:57:14.919
to understand. But um nothing below that level, I

1096
00:57:14.929 --> 00:57:18.129
think is meaningfully alive. The cell is the unit

1097
00:57:18.139 --> 00:57:22.239
of, of, of life. So, in some sense, that

1098
00:57:22.250 --> 00:57:25.860
is where it needs to start. And again, we

1099
00:57:25.870 --> 00:57:28.429
found out things about what cells do and what

1100
00:57:28.439 --> 00:57:31.100
they're capable of over the past sort of two

1101
00:57:31.110 --> 00:57:35.340
decades or so that used to that really overturn

1102
00:57:35.350 --> 00:57:38.219
old ideas about that. And one of the most

1103
00:57:38.229 --> 00:57:42.139
uh profound is we found out how in what,

1104
00:57:42.149 --> 00:57:46.000
what biologists um scientists generally call how plastic the

1105
00:57:46.010 --> 00:57:49.379
cell is, which really means how uh able it

1106
00:57:49.389 --> 00:57:52.780
is to switch the state that it's in. So

1107
00:57:52.790 --> 00:57:55.790
the the old story was that our cells, you

1108
00:57:55.800 --> 00:57:58.389
know, we developed from a single celled embryo from

1109
00:57:58.399 --> 00:58:02.080
a fertilized egg and uh to begin with, those

1110
00:58:02.090 --> 00:58:04.889
cells are said to be pluripotent. They're sort of

1111
00:58:04.899 --> 00:58:07.679
like stem cells, they can make any tissue type

1112
00:58:07.689 --> 00:58:11.550
in the body. And gradually as the cells multiply,

1113
00:58:11.750 --> 00:58:15.560
they get more and more specialized in different regions

1114
00:58:15.570 --> 00:58:18.459
to become particular tissue types and ultimately to become

1115
00:58:18.469 --> 00:58:21.479
particular organs uh to make the, the whole organism.

1116
00:58:21.739 --> 00:58:24.600
And that's absolutely, you know, true. That's the way

1117
00:58:24.610 --> 00:58:28.080
things happen. Um We now see how, actually how

1118
00:58:28.090 --> 00:58:30.989
contextual that is, uh we have be better ways

1119
00:58:31.000 --> 00:58:33.679
of, of following that developmental process. And we can

1120
00:58:33.689 --> 00:58:36.199
see that cells sometimes, you know, they seem to

1121
00:58:36.209 --> 00:58:37.909
be following one path and then they kind of

1122
00:58:37.919 --> 00:58:40.100
switch and you know, t turn into a different

1123
00:58:40.110 --> 00:58:42.774
tissue type because of the messages they've received from

1124
00:58:42.784 --> 00:58:45.685
the cells around them. So again, just as molecules

1125
00:58:45.695 --> 00:58:48.975
are like committees, making decisions, so are cells, they're,

1126
00:58:48.985 --> 00:58:51.814
they're responding to all their, their neighbors in terms

1127
00:58:51.824 --> 00:58:54.534
of deciding what kind of cell they're going to

1128
00:58:54.544 --> 00:58:57.445
become, which is to say what the daughter cells

1129
00:58:57.455 --> 00:58:59.534
when cells divide, you know what sorts of cells

1130
00:58:59.544 --> 00:59:02.790
they will be. Um And the thing that we

1131
00:59:02.800 --> 00:59:05.939
have uh discovered uh this was really in 2,

1132
00:59:05.949 --> 00:59:11.550
2006, 2, 2005, 2006, 2007 was um that, that

1133
00:59:11.560 --> 00:59:14.850
process, which used to be thought of as unidirectional

1134
00:59:14.860 --> 00:59:18.560
from stem cell like states to mature tissues where

1135
00:59:18.570 --> 00:59:20.780
the cells are, you know, skin cells or whatever,

1136
00:59:20.949 --> 00:59:25.189
that actually is reversible, we can reverse the state

1137
00:59:25.199 --> 00:59:27.860
of even of, of uh skin cells and turn

1138
00:59:27.870 --> 00:59:30.879
them back into a stem cell like state. Um

1139
00:59:30.939 --> 00:59:34.280
That was that, that abs uh absolutely amazed uh

1140
00:59:34.290 --> 00:59:37.110
biologists, even though there were some reasons to think

1141
00:59:37.120 --> 00:59:40.010
there might be this sort of plastic plasticity from

1142
00:59:40.020 --> 00:59:43.739
older work. The, the really the ease with which

1143
00:59:43.750 --> 00:59:46.310
that can be done. Basically, you have to just

1144
00:59:46.320 --> 00:59:49.770
give um uh skin cells. Uh A few, you,

1145
00:59:49.780 --> 00:59:52.600
you use a virus to um bring, bring into

1146
00:59:52.610 --> 00:59:55.219
it some genes that are known to be active

1147
00:59:55.229 --> 00:59:58.320
in stem cells. The reason I'm actually uh attacking

1148
00:59:58.330 --> 01:00:00.979
my uh when I'm talking about this is that

1149
01:00:00.989 --> 01:00:02.919
I've had this done to my own skin cells

1150
01:00:02.929 --> 01:00:05.800
taken from my shoulder, which were turned by these

1151
01:00:05.810 --> 01:00:08.770
techniques into a stem cell like state and then

1152
01:00:08.780 --> 01:00:13.399
grown into neurons. So skin into neurons, it just

1153
01:00:13.409 --> 01:00:15.439
it's it was the most astonishing thing. And then

1154
01:00:15.449 --> 01:00:18.800
those neurons start to organize themselves into things that

1155
01:00:18.810 --> 01:00:21.560
look a little bit like brain like structures. Because

1156
01:00:21.570 --> 01:00:25.270
cells seem to have that intrinsic knowledge of, you

1157
01:00:25.280 --> 01:00:29.110
know, once they become particular types of cell, they

1158
01:00:29.120 --> 01:00:32.820
have if you like some intrinsic knowledge of how

1159
01:00:32.830 --> 01:00:35.080
that kind of type of cell needs to be

1160
01:00:35.090 --> 01:00:39.239
arranged and organized in the tissue in question. And

1161
01:00:39.250 --> 01:00:42.020
so, you know, the skin cells that would form

1162
01:00:42.030 --> 01:00:45.939
sheets of skin um once they've been reprogrammed, and

1163
01:00:45.949 --> 01:00:48.699
this is the terminology that's used to, to be

1164
01:00:48.709 --> 01:00:52.000
neurons, they start to create neuron like structures which

1165
01:00:52.010 --> 01:00:56.040
look more like brain like neural neural networks. So,

1166
01:00:56.250 --> 01:00:59.270
you know, this overturned our our notion of what

1167
01:00:59.280 --> 01:01:03.760
cells can do. And the the the the whole

1168
01:01:03.770 --> 01:01:06.449
sort of business of understanding how cells II I

1169
01:01:06.459 --> 01:01:10.080
it's called um how, how cells acquire their fate

1170
01:01:10.090 --> 01:01:11.750
if you like, which sounds a bit doomy. But

1171
01:01:11.760 --> 01:01:13.800
actually, it just means what amount of tissue they,

1172
01:01:13.810 --> 01:01:17.030
they, they, they make th this this uh process

1173
01:01:17.040 --> 01:01:20.500
of fate selection by cells and how that involves

1174
01:01:20.510 --> 01:01:23.530
genes and how that involves, you know, integrating information

1175
01:01:23.550 --> 01:01:26.060
from around it as well. In order to make

1176
01:01:26.070 --> 01:01:29.669
that decision, that's another area that has really just

1177
01:01:29.679 --> 01:01:32.340
boomed in recent times and in ways that are

1178
01:01:32.350 --> 01:01:35.889
fantastically useful. Because if we can control sulfates and

1179
01:01:35.899 --> 01:01:38.945
if we can grow cells into different tissue types,

1180
01:01:38.955 --> 01:01:42.824
there are all sorts of possibilities for regenerative medicine

1181
01:01:42.834 --> 01:01:45.685
and for tissue engineering. And we're starting to see

1182
01:01:45.695 --> 01:01:49.264
some of those possibilities realized in medicine. So this

1183
01:01:49.274 --> 01:01:51.554
is not just uh an aspect of, you know,

1184
01:01:51.564 --> 01:01:54.935
fundamentally understanding how we come into being, it's also

1185
01:01:54.945 --> 01:01:58.344
something that has real medical applications.

1186
01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:02.500
So when earlier you said that you think of

1187
01:02:02.510 --> 01:02:06.219
the cell as the unit of life, does that

1188
01:02:06.229 --> 01:02:09.179
mean that you also think about it as the

1189
01:02:09.459 --> 01:02:14.879
unit of selection in evolution or not? And, and

1190
01:02:14.889 --> 01:02:17.340
I mean, of course, uh I'm not trying to

1191
01:02:17.350 --> 01:02:20.094
commit you to any particular kind of, of uh

1192
01:02:20.104 --> 01:02:24.195
level of selection here, you can be, you can

1193
01:02:24.205 --> 01:02:27.905
come from the paradigm of multilevel selection and perhaps

1194
01:02:27.915 --> 01:02:31.604
we can also come back to that when after

1195
01:02:31.614 --> 01:02:35.625
we talk about tissues, organs and bodies. But uh

1196
01:02:35.635 --> 01:02:38.324
does the uh are you, are, were you trying

1197
01:02:38.334 --> 01:02:40.064
to imply that or not?

1198
01:02:40.485 --> 01:02:42.625
No, I wasn't trying to imply that. And in

1199
01:02:42.635 --> 01:02:45.120
fact, to be honest, I was trying to duck

1200
01:02:45.129 --> 01:02:48.689
that question. Um I have, you know, the book

1201
01:02:48.699 --> 01:02:51.350
ends. Um There's a sort of box section of

1202
01:02:51.360 --> 01:02:53.520
text right at the end of the book which

1203
01:02:53.530 --> 01:02:56.239
says, uh which asks what does all of this

1204
01:02:56.250 --> 01:03:00.260
stuff mean for evolution. Um And I'd, uh although

1205
01:03:00.270 --> 01:03:02.770
I, I've had to talk about evolutionary processes at

1206
01:03:02.780 --> 01:03:05.860
various times throughout the book, um I was kind

1207
01:03:05.870 --> 01:03:09.459
of putting that broad question to one side for

1208
01:03:09.469 --> 01:03:12.790
two reasons. Um One is that I don't think

1209
01:03:12.800 --> 01:03:16.350
anyone knows the answer to that yet, quite what

1210
01:03:16.360 --> 01:03:19.639
the implications are for evolution of these, um you

1211
01:03:19.649 --> 01:03:23.239
know, more complex uh narratives and more complex ideas

1212
01:03:23.250 --> 01:03:26.439
about the way we work. But certainly the second

1213
01:03:26.449 --> 01:03:30.060
reason was that I know just enough about evolutionary

1214
01:03:30.070 --> 01:03:33.409
theory to uh to, to know how little I

1215
01:03:33.419 --> 01:03:36.229
know. Um AND I, and to, and to know

1216
01:03:36.239 --> 01:03:41.780
how complex and subtle these evolutionary questions are. And

1217
01:03:41.790 --> 01:03:45.060
so I it's uh to, to understand what these

1218
01:03:45.070 --> 01:03:48.810
ideas mean for evolutionary theory, it's, it would require

1219
01:03:48.820 --> 01:03:52.679
an another entire book and it's a book that

1220
01:03:52.689 --> 01:03:55.251
certainly at this stage anyway, it could not be

1221
01:03:55.261 --> 01:03:57.471
written by me because I don't feel I have

1222
01:03:57.481 --> 01:04:00.082
the, the knowledge to do so. So there is

1223
01:04:00.092 --> 01:04:02.441
this big debate that's been going on for, you

1224
01:04:02.451 --> 01:04:05.092
know, decades about what is the level of uh

1225
01:04:05.102 --> 01:04:08.531
of which selection happens. And, you know, it's clearly

1226
01:04:08.541 --> 01:04:13.302
complicated in the sense that ultimately selection for organisms

1227
01:04:13.312 --> 01:04:15.362
happens at the level of the whole organism, the

1228
01:04:15.372 --> 01:04:18.572
whole organism, you know, either thrives or dies or

1229
01:04:18.582 --> 01:04:20.642
is killed or whatever. So, you know, it happens

1230
01:04:20.652 --> 01:04:24.451
at that level. Um But what that means clearly

1231
01:04:24.461 --> 01:04:28.043
is that if it dies, it's genes that, which

1232
01:04:28.053 --> 01:04:31.003
is to say the particular variants of it that

1233
01:04:31.013 --> 01:04:33.384
are in its genome don't get passed on to

1234
01:04:33.394 --> 01:04:35.864
progeny if it hasn't yet had any. So, you

1235
01:04:35.874 --> 01:04:38.343
know, that's the whole basis of natural selection, right?

1236
01:04:38.354 --> 01:04:40.573
And uh a and clearly, as I say, because

1237
01:04:40.583 --> 01:04:43.214
genes do have this privileged status, they're the thing

1238
01:04:43.224 --> 01:04:46.283
that gets passed on to progeny. Um YOU know,

1239
01:04:46.293 --> 01:04:48.813
the a a at that, that's why the, the

1240
01:04:48.823 --> 01:04:52.674
traditional idea is that selection happens at the level

1241
01:04:52.684 --> 01:04:54.956
of the gene. And there have been, I mean,

1242
01:04:55.065 --> 01:04:58.045
all kinds of arguments um from people who know

1243
01:04:58.055 --> 01:05:00.716
far more about evolutionary theory than I do over

1244
01:05:00.726 --> 01:05:03.476
the years of whether that's the whole story or

1245
01:05:03.486 --> 01:05:06.785
whether there can be s selection at other levels

1246
01:05:06.795 --> 01:05:09.426
in biology. And particularly there was a, a, you

1247
01:05:09.436 --> 01:05:11.986
know, a big argument between Richard Dawkins and um

1248
01:05:11.996 --> 01:05:15.355
Eo Wilson about the idea of group selection of

1249
01:05:15.365 --> 01:05:17.956
whether selection happens, not just at the level of

1250
01:05:17.966 --> 01:05:20.706
individual organisms, but there are things that, you know,

1251
01:05:20.716 --> 01:05:23.156
are good for the group uh that are sort

1252
01:05:23.166 --> 01:05:25.929
of transferred in the genome. And um A a

1253
01:05:25.939 --> 01:05:30.010
and yy, you know, II I think um the

1254
01:05:30.020 --> 01:05:32.600
fact that those arguments are happening is a reflection

1255
01:05:32.610 --> 01:05:35.060
of how subtle these questions are and they're not

1256
01:05:35.070 --> 01:05:38.780
resolved yet. Um So that's really all I felt

1257
01:05:38.790 --> 01:05:42.139
I could say about uh the implications for evolutionary

1258
01:05:42.149 --> 01:05:45.310
biology to recognize that there are these uh uh

1259
01:05:45.320 --> 01:05:49.520
these still open questions and that I think it's

1260
01:05:49.530 --> 01:05:52.080
for others who know more about the subject than

1261
01:05:52.090 --> 01:05:55.239
me to try to integrate them into this new

1262
01:05:55.250 --> 01:05:56.879
picture of how life works.

1263
01:05:57.620 --> 01:06:00.540
Fair enough. So, uh let me ask you now

1264
01:06:00.550 --> 01:06:03.800
a little bit about tissues, organs and bodies. So

1265
01:06:03.860 --> 01:06:09.520
how does uh a cell know uh that I

1266
01:06:09.530 --> 01:06:14.620
it should grow that it should replicate and when

1267
01:06:14.629 --> 01:06:18.379
to stop? Because this is also very relevant, for

1268
01:06:18.389 --> 01:06:24.340
example, to um things like understanding how t tumors

1269
01:06:24.350 --> 01:06:28.729
and cancers grow because that's basically uh it starts

1270
01:06:28.739 --> 01:06:33.129
from one single cell uh not being able to

1271
01:06:33.139 --> 01:06:35.810
stop replicating. Right.

1272
01:06:35.929 --> 01:06:38.669
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Well, I mean, the answer to

1273
01:06:38.679 --> 01:06:40.719
that question is one of the reasons why I

1274
01:06:40.729 --> 01:06:43.406
think um it, it, it doesn't really make any

1275
01:06:43.416 --> 01:06:46.635
sense in developmental terms to think of uh our

1276
01:06:46.656 --> 01:06:49.565
development as a simple read out from the genome

1277
01:06:49.575 --> 01:06:53.565
because those decisions, they're clearly crucial. You know, how

1278
01:06:53.575 --> 01:06:56.635
does an organ, an organ know when to stop

1279
01:06:56.645 --> 01:06:58.966
our organs grow to a certain size and then

1280
01:06:58.976 --> 01:07:01.605
they stop, how do they know that it's not

1281
01:07:01.615 --> 01:07:05.052
programmed um into the, you know, they no gene

1282
01:07:05.062 --> 01:07:07.531
that is kind of suddenly kicks in and you

1283
01:07:07.541 --> 01:07:10.771
know, stops that process at a certain stage. It's

1284
01:07:10.781 --> 01:07:14.681
a again, it's contextual information made at the level

1285
01:07:14.691 --> 01:07:17.582
of the tissue. So one way in which, for

1286
01:07:17.592 --> 01:07:20.662
example, that ha it's really about how cells communicate

1287
01:07:20.672 --> 01:07:23.072
with one another to know what they're up to.

1288
01:07:23.082 --> 01:07:24.711
That's really, you know, that I think that's the

1289
01:07:24.721 --> 01:07:27.330
right way to kind of think about it. Um,

1290
01:07:27.459 --> 01:07:29.479
THEY have to know, you know, how, what, what,

1291
01:07:29.489 --> 01:07:31.409
what are the ne, how many neighbors have I

1292
01:07:31.419 --> 01:07:33.449
got, you know, how big has this whole sort

1293
01:07:33.459 --> 01:07:37.820
of tissue got? And um they communicate in general

1294
01:07:37.830 --> 01:07:40.179
in three ways. One is chemical, they send out

1295
01:07:40.189 --> 01:07:42.840
things like hormones that, you know, get sort of

1296
01:07:42.850 --> 01:07:45.969
plug into uh proteins at the surface of other

1297
01:07:45.979 --> 01:07:48.290
cells and create signals that go down to the

1298
01:07:48.300 --> 01:07:51.649
genome and and so forth. Um One is uh

1299
01:07:51.669 --> 01:07:55.620
um electrical. So all cells not just uh neurons,

1300
01:07:55.629 --> 01:07:58.790
but actually all cells um in general have the

1301
01:07:58.800 --> 01:08:02.129
potential for making electrical connections with others that kind

1302
01:08:02.139 --> 01:08:06.179
of sense the gradients in, in voltage really and

1303
01:08:06.189 --> 01:08:09.570
potential across cell membranes. And you know, that seems

1304
01:08:09.580 --> 01:08:13.360
to be AAA control mechanism. Um AND one of

1305
01:08:13.370 --> 01:08:16.399
the most crucial is mechanical. So cells, you know,

1306
01:08:16.410 --> 01:08:18.839
if you, if you actually, if you just sort

1307
01:08:18.850 --> 01:08:21.430
of tug on a cell, you can change its

1308
01:08:21.439 --> 01:08:23.669
cell fate, you can change the kind of cell

1309
01:08:23.680 --> 01:08:25.240
that it will turn into. If you tug on

1310
01:08:25.250 --> 01:08:26.990
a stem cell. And that's why if you grow

1311
01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:30.959
stem cells on a soft surface, they might develop

1312
01:08:30.970 --> 01:08:32.839
in a different direction than if you grow them

1313
01:08:32.850 --> 01:08:35.330
on a hard surface cos they're responding to the,

1314
01:08:35.379 --> 01:08:38.500
the, the tensions created by adhesion to those different

1315
01:08:38.509 --> 01:08:42.529
Surfas. So they respond to mechanical uh signals. And

1316
01:08:42.541 --> 01:08:45.960
so, for example, that's how it is that if

1317
01:08:45.970 --> 01:08:49.500
a um a fetus is growing with some kind

1318
01:08:49.511 --> 01:08:51.670
of, let's say some kind of developmental defect, that

1319
01:08:51.680 --> 01:08:55.189
means maybe a limb is shorter than uh you

1320
01:08:55.201 --> 01:08:57.791
know, it, it might, than it might normally be.

1321
01:08:57.890 --> 01:09:00.029
Um IT'S kind of, you know, when we think

1322
01:09:00.041 --> 01:09:01.630
about, when you think about it, you think, well,

1323
01:09:01.640 --> 01:09:04.121
how does, how do all the different tissues of

1324
01:09:04.130 --> 01:09:06.633
that limb know to stop growing? You know, if

1325
01:09:06.644 --> 01:09:09.144
your, if your bone isn't growing enough. Ok. That's

1326
01:09:09.153 --> 01:09:10.923
one thing. But then why do all the other

1327
01:09:10.934 --> 01:09:14.184
tissues respond? Well, one way it happens is that

1328
01:09:14.193 --> 01:09:16.792
the um the, as the skin is growing, the,

1329
01:09:16.804 --> 01:09:20.304
the cells are sensing the tension in that skin.

1330
01:09:20.514 --> 01:09:22.684
And you know, if the skin has become too

1331
01:09:22.693 --> 01:09:26.624
taut, then uh the um the, the cells know

1332
01:09:26.633 --> 01:09:29.913
they need to c continue proliferating and release that

1333
01:09:29.923 --> 01:09:32.755
tension. If it's become too loose, then they will

1334
01:09:32.765 --> 01:09:36.685
stop growing. So there's that mechanical sensing that happens

1335
01:09:36.694 --> 01:09:39.755
at the tissue level that is determining things like

1336
01:09:39.765 --> 01:09:43.604
the overall morphology of the organism. And that I

1337
01:09:43.616 --> 01:09:46.194
don't see that as you know, in any meaningful

1338
01:09:46.206 --> 01:09:49.234
sense encoded in the, in, in the genome because

1339
01:09:49.246 --> 01:09:52.166
it's entirely contextual, it depends on what the other

1340
01:09:52.175 --> 01:09:54.456
things around it are doing and sometimes it might

1341
01:09:54.465 --> 01:09:58.939
depend on environmental signals outside the whole organism. Um

1342
01:09:59.209 --> 01:10:02.009
So, y you know, th th this is another

1343
01:10:02.020 --> 01:10:05.009
sort of uh reflection of how at each level

1344
01:10:05.020 --> 01:10:07.669
of the biological hierarchy, there are rules that are

1345
01:10:07.680 --> 01:10:12.660
governing the, the growth and the morphology that are

1346
01:10:12.669 --> 01:10:17.904
drawing on uh gene resources and they're perhaps feeding

1347
01:10:17.915 --> 01:10:20.165
back to genetic resources. So that, you know, the

1348
01:10:20.174 --> 01:10:23.524
cells stopping growing means that there's something happening at

1349
01:10:23.535 --> 01:10:26.225
the level of the genome. But that are actually

1350
01:10:26.234 --> 01:10:31.185
using informa contextual information from the environment rather than

1351
01:10:31.194 --> 01:10:32.785
simply following a program.

1352
01:10:34.220 --> 01:10:37.640
OK. But i it's one thing for cells and

1353
01:10:37.649 --> 01:10:41.799
tissues to know when to grow, for cells, to

1354
01:10:41.810 --> 01:10:44.799
know when to replicate or when to stop replicating.

1355
01:10:44.810 --> 01:10:49.310
But uh how is it that or why is

1356
01:10:49.319 --> 01:10:53.330
it that organs have particular kinds of shapes and

1357
01:10:53.339 --> 01:10:56.640
also bodies have particular kinds of shapes? I mean,

1358
01:10:56.649 --> 01:11:01.160
uh how do we go from uh cells to

1359
01:11:01.169 --> 01:11:05.490
tissues and then to particular kinds of shapes of

1360
01:11:05.500 --> 01:11:08.169
organs and entire organism? Yeah.

1361
01:11:08.180 --> 01:11:11.490
Well, I mean that uh really that question is

1362
01:11:11.500 --> 01:11:13.720
the whole of developmental biology, which is, you know,

1363
01:11:13.729 --> 01:11:16.229
a huge field and still unfolding. And we don't

1364
01:11:16.240 --> 01:11:18.990
understand the answers to all those questions, but we

1365
01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:21.450
do, yeah, we do have answers in some specific

1366
01:11:21.459 --> 01:11:25.419
cases. So, um for example, if we think about

1367
01:11:25.430 --> 01:11:27.979
the, how the the lung grows, um It's a

1368
01:11:27.990 --> 01:11:31.939
branching process. Um And one that has lots of

1369
01:11:31.950 --> 01:11:34.149
similarity, not just in terms of how the thing

1370
01:11:34.160 --> 01:11:36.689
looks, but perhaps in terms of the basic physics

1371
01:11:36.700 --> 01:11:39.459
of that process with the growth of a tree

1372
01:11:39.470 --> 01:11:42.089
or the growth of a river network, the, you

1373
01:11:42.100 --> 01:11:44.689
know, the branches grow and then they maybe split

1374
01:11:44.700 --> 01:11:46.350
and they, you know, they grow off and they

1375
01:11:46.359 --> 01:11:49.000
split again and it's a, that's a sort of

1376
01:11:49.009 --> 01:11:52.509
complex process, a sort of um feedback process really.

1377
01:11:52.520 --> 01:11:54.439
So, for example, you know, the same is true

1378
01:11:54.450 --> 01:11:57.189
of our uh uh the our system of blood

1379
01:11:57.200 --> 01:12:01.120
vessels. Um AND that's really about um at the

1380
01:12:01.129 --> 01:12:04.770
level, at the finest level of capillaries. Um THAT'S

1381
01:12:04.779 --> 01:12:06.839
contingent. It's like the way I was talking about

1382
01:12:06.850 --> 01:12:09.950
our brain wires up, there's nothing programmed in that.

1383
01:12:09.959 --> 01:12:12.759
It's cells making decisions on the hoof about what's

1384
01:12:12.770 --> 01:12:15.560
needed. And the way that happens is that if

1385
01:12:15.569 --> 01:12:19.569
a tissue doesn't have an adequate uh blood supply,

1386
01:12:19.669 --> 01:12:22.560
so there are no nearby capillaries and it's not

1387
01:12:22.569 --> 01:12:25.060
getting oxygen, these cells kind of send out a

1388
01:12:25.069 --> 01:12:28.490
distress signal, a chemical distress signal, they change their

1389
01:12:28.500 --> 01:12:31.049
state to into this uh this state that is,

1390
01:12:31.060 --> 01:12:33.319
you know, creating this signal. And it's basically a

1391
01:12:33.330 --> 01:12:37.609
signal that tells the um the blood vessel forming

1392
01:12:37.620 --> 01:12:40.879
cells come over here and they will uh you

1393
01:12:40.890 --> 01:12:43.950
know, they'll start to proliferate and um you know,

1394
01:12:43.959 --> 01:12:48.319
towards that region of oxygen depletion and create a

1395
01:12:48.330 --> 01:12:52.220
new uh blood vessel that way. So it's entirely

1396
01:12:52.229 --> 01:12:55.100
sort of contingent. And y you know, it's, it's,

1397
01:12:55.109 --> 01:12:57.459
it's, it's kind of improvising, I suppose as it

1398
01:12:57.470 --> 01:13:00.939
goes. Um But then there are other uh developmental

1399
01:13:00.950 --> 01:13:04.359
processes that are more uh the, the, the more

1400
01:13:04.370 --> 01:13:06.540
you could say, more deterministic in that you, they

1401
01:13:06.549 --> 01:13:08.680
will turn out a certain way unless something goes

1402
01:13:08.689 --> 01:13:10.759
wrong, you know, uh in general, we all have

1403
01:13:10.770 --> 01:13:13.660
five fingers, for example, you know, but there is

1404
01:13:13.669 --> 01:13:16.680
no gene that prescribes that there is no gene

1405
01:13:16.689 --> 01:13:19.399
for the five of our fingers or toes. The

1406
01:13:19.410 --> 01:13:22.609
way that process works um is uh and this

1407
01:13:22.620 --> 01:13:24.709
is a, a, you know, a beautiful example of

1408
01:13:24.720 --> 01:13:26.549
the kind of a one of those processes that

1409
01:13:26.560 --> 01:13:30.069
happen at that developmental level that we now think

1410
01:13:30.080 --> 01:13:34.180
that um it's related to AAA process that was

1411
01:13:34.189 --> 01:13:37.850
first um talked about theoretically by the, the mathematician

1412
01:13:37.859 --> 01:13:41.040
Alan Turing in the 19 fifties. Um WHERE turing

1413
01:13:41.049 --> 01:13:43.500
showed that it hh how it's possible when he

1414
01:13:43.509 --> 01:13:45.870
was interested in. He, he asked this question because

1415
01:13:45.879 --> 01:13:48.979
he was interested in development too. Um He, he

1416
01:13:48.990 --> 01:13:52.580
showed that it was possible for particular mixtures of

1417
01:13:52.589 --> 01:13:55.700
different chemical agents if they have particular properties of

1418
01:13:55.709 --> 01:13:57.979
how they react with themselves and with each other,

1419
01:13:58.129 --> 01:14:00.640
um in some circumstances, you can start off with

1420
01:14:00.649 --> 01:14:03.620
a totally uniform uh mixture of them and they

1421
01:14:03.629 --> 01:14:08.750
will spontaneously separate into regions with different concentrations of

1422
01:14:08.759 --> 01:14:11.859
the different amounts. So into a kind of patchiness

1423
01:14:11.990 --> 01:14:16.001
and the generic form that tend to arise from

1424
01:14:16.012 --> 01:14:19.782
that so called tearing process are spots and stripes.

1425
01:14:19.832 --> 01:14:22.932
Um So like sort of zebra stripe type patterns

1426
01:14:22.941 --> 01:14:26.051
or, you know, random more or less randomly sort

1427
01:14:26.062 --> 01:14:29.051
of uh positioned spots. And we see both of

1428
01:14:29.062 --> 01:14:32.282
those processes in biology and it seems that this

1429
01:14:32.291 --> 01:14:35.512
tearing process is really used by biology. So the

1430
01:14:35.521 --> 01:14:38.321
spotlight processes you can see in the hair fo

1431
01:14:38.332 --> 01:14:41.644
in our hair follicles, uh for example, that, um

1432
01:14:41.653 --> 01:14:44.034
you know, the little pores and the follicles that,

1433
01:14:44.043 --> 01:14:46.983
that uh that, that make the hairs, they're, they're

1434
01:14:46.994 --> 01:14:49.023
like these sort of spotty patterns. And we think

1435
01:14:49.034 --> 01:14:51.113
that that seems to be a turing like process,

1436
01:14:51.124 --> 01:14:55.264
our fingers are stripes, they're turing stripes. So as

1437
01:14:55.273 --> 01:14:57.273
the lim bud develops, it starts off as a

1438
01:14:57.284 --> 01:15:00.383
sort of paddle, um you know, an undifferentiated paddle,

1439
01:15:00.394 --> 01:15:03.574
but there is a uh an interaction between some

1440
01:15:03.583 --> 01:15:06.144
of these developmental proteins that I talked about earlier

1441
01:15:06.153 --> 01:15:09.766
on that causes uh the, the, the appearance of

1442
01:15:09.775 --> 01:15:14.166
stripes within which g bone forming uh genes are

1443
01:15:14.175 --> 01:15:16.155
switched on. So you start to get the bones

1444
01:15:16.166 --> 01:15:18.815
forming and then in the tissue in between um

1445
01:15:18.826 --> 01:15:21.795
the cells die away and you know, the, the

1446
01:15:21.806 --> 01:15:24.295
and you, you, that's why there's, there's nothing there.

1447
01:15:24.306 --> 01:15:27.136
And that's why sometimes if that doesn't happen fully,

1448
01:15:27.145 --> 01:15:29.405
you get sort of webbed skin, you know, that

1449
01:15:29.416 --> 01:15:32.445
uh sometimes happens between f fingers or, or, or,

1450
01:15:32.456 --> 01:15:35.640
or, or toes. So, you know, that's uh uh

1451
01:15:35.649 --> 01:15:38.709
that's how that process it's work is working, it's

1452
01:15:38.720 --> 01:15:42.930
drawing again on the on genetically encoded developmental proteins,

1453
01:15:42.939 --> 01:15:44.890
but they're proteins that do all sorts of other

1454
01:15:44.899 --> 01:15:47.649
things as well. And the actual process that is

1455
01:15:47.660 --> 01:15:51.589
creating this structure is one that it's a higher

1456
01:15:51.600 --> 01:15:55.629
level uh process that's kind of self organizing itself

1457
01:15:55.640 --> 01:15:56.790
into these structures.

1458
01:15:58.330 --> 01:16:02.509
So earlier in our conversation, we talked about uh

1459
01:16:02.520 --> 01:16:07.520
words and things like meaning, purpose goals. But I

1460
01:16:07.529 --> 01:16:11.790
think that we left out of that discussion or

1461
01:16:11.799 --> 01:16:15.799
we saved for later uh uh discussion surrounding the

1462
01:16:15.810 --> 01:16:20.750
term agent or, and what agency means. So what

1463
01:16:20.759 --> 01:16:26.129
is an agent i in biological terms? And I

1464
01:16:26.140 --> 01:16:31.080
mean, at what level can we see uh agency?

1465
01:16:31.089 --> 01:16:35.330
I mean, can, for example, a single celled organism

1466
01:16:35.339 --> 01:16:38.970
already be an agent or does it need to

1467
01:16:38.979 --> 01:16:40.839
be more complex than that?

1468
01:16:41.220 --> 01:16:43.924
Well, again, it a word that doesn't have any

1469
01:16:43.935 --> 01:16:46.884
generally agreed meaning and it certainly differs in meaning

1470
01:16:46.895 --> 01:16:51.035
across different scientific disciplines. So there are uh some,

1471
01:16:51.044 --> 01:16:53.595
I guess maybe in psychology who, who, who, who

1472
01:16:53.604 --> 01:16:57.734
would uh only recognize agency as something that involves

1473
01:16:57.745 --> 01:17:01.419
intention and uh that involves, you know, uh sort

1474
01:17:01.430 --> 01:17:05.459
of conscious cognition that's, you know, an expression of

1475
01:17:05.470 --> 01:17:10.140
our human agency. Um Within engineering, there is a

1476
01:17:10.149 --> 01:17:12.370
uh uh uh can be a meaning of agency

1477
01:17:12.379 --> 01:17:14.879
that doesn't necessarily correlate with the one in biology.

1478
01:17:14.890 --> 01:17:17.680
So it depends who you ask. But the way

1479
01:17:17.689 --> 01:17:19.665
I talk about it in the book and the

1480
01:17:19.674 --> 01:17:22.615
way that I think is perhaps um it feels

1481
01:17:22.625 --> 01:17:24.484
the most meaningful way to think about it in

1482
01:17:24.495 --> 01:17:29.134
biology is um agency is the ability of some

1483
01:17:29.145 --> 01:17:33.705
entity of an organism basically to um well, it's

1484
01:17:33.714 --> 01:17:36.095
the ability of an agent. Let's leave it general

1485
01:17:36.104 --> 01:17:40.660
like that to um uh to set itself goals,

1486
01:17:40.669 --> 01:17:43.899
to have self determined goals and to manipulate its

1487
01:17:43.910 --> 01:17:48.609
environment and perhaps itself in order to attain those

1488
01:17:48.620 --> 01:17:51.750
goals, an entity that can do that is an

1489
01:17:51.759 --> 01:17:52.229
agent.

1490
01:17:54.379 --> 01:17:58.339
Uh But, but then uh it, it, that sort

1491
01:17:58.350 --> 01:18:01.879
of entity could be a single celled organism.

1492
01:18:02.240 --> 01:18:04.209
I think so. Yes, I would abso well, in

1493
01:18:04.220 --> 01:18:06.439
fact, I would absolutely say it can be that

1494
01:18:06.450 --> 01:18:09.220
um you know, there's plenty of good reasons now,

1495
01:18:09.229 --> 01:18:13.439
good experimental evidence to, to, to, to see that

1496
01:18:13.450 --> 01:18:17.140
single cells, bacteria or even, you know, single cells,

1497
01:18:17.149 --> 01:18:20.995
Varian tissues have a kind of agency for, for

1498
01:18:21.004 --> 01:18:24.754
example, you can in, in cell cultures of, you

1499
01:18:24.765 --> 01:18:28.334
know, bac bacterial cells or our own cells, they

1500
01:18:28.345 --> 01:18:31.305
are nominally, you can grow them. Um YOU know,

1501
01:18:31.314 --> 01:18:34.785
so that they're nominally identical cells, they're, they're genetically

1502
01:18:34.794 --> 01:18:37.745
identical, they've had the same kind of history, you

1503
01:18:37.754 --> 01:18:39.584
know, as far as you can tell. And yet

1504
01:18:39.595 --> 01:18:42.225
you can provide those cells with some kind of

1505
01:18:42.234 --> 01:18:45.225
stimulus, maybe heat or maybe some chemical and they

1506
01:18:45.234 --> 01:18:49.290
won't all respond in the same way. Um BECAUSE

1507
01:18:49.299 --> 01:18:52.850
there are maybe just, you know, sort of random

1508
01:18:52.859 --> 01:18:54.830
uh or maybe non random because of where they

1509
01:18:54.839 --> 01:18:58.009
are in the colony differences that have arisen between

1510
01:18:58.020 --> 01:19:01.299
them, that have created differences in the internal state

1511
01:19:01.310 --> 01:19:03.919
of those cells, which mole, which genes they're expressing,

1512
01:19:03.930 --> 01:19:08.399
which molecules they are making. Um And those are

1513
01:19:08.410 --> 01:19:11.560
uh it, it, it, and that internal state is

1514
01:19:11.569 --> 01:19:14.379
an aspect of the decision that each cell makes

1515
01:19:14.390 --> 01:19:16.629
in order to, you know, to, about responding to

1516
01:19:16.640 --> 01:19:20.750
this stimulus. So that's a characteristic of agents that

1517
01:19:20.759 --> 01:19:24.339
they're not just sort of autonomous, that automatically give

1518
01:19:24.350 --> 01:19:26.629
them a ST a particular stimulus and they'll respond

1519
01:19:26.640 --> 01:19:28.500
in a certain way. You know, there's a, a

1520
01:19:28.509 --> 01:19:31.229
degree to which that is true, certainly for single

1521
01:19:31.240 --> 01:19:33.680
cells. But we know that it's not always true

1522
01:19:33.689 --> 01:19:36.712
that it depends also on the internal state of

1523
01:19:36.723 --> 01:19:38.223
the agent. And this is one of the, I

1524
01:19:38.232 --> 01:19:41.143
mean, in you mentioned Kevin Mitchell's book um o

1525
01:19:41.152 --> 01:19:44.272
on Agency and he, Kevin has a nice um

1526
01:19:44.283 --> 01:19:46.232
I, in fact, it's, it's work that he did

1527
01:19:46.243 --> 01:19:49.382
with uh uh his student, Henry Potter where they

1528
01:19:49.393 --> 01:19:53.683
have a, a nice um breakdown of characteristics that

1529
01:19:53.692 --> 01:19:57.823
agents have. And this dependence on internal states is

1530
01:19:57.833 --> 01:20:00.132
one of them. And what that tells you is

1531
01:20:00.143 --> 01:20:03.513
that an agent has to have some internal complexity

1532
01:20:04.016 --> 01:20:06.465
in order to really qualify as an agent. And

1533
01:20:06.476 --> 01:20:09.136
that's why a gene can't because it simply doesn't.

1534
01:20:09.145 --> 01:20:11.886
And a protein really doesn't. There are some proteins

1535
01:20:11.895 --> 01:20:13.775
that are sort of big enough and complex enough

1536
01:20:13.786 --> 01:20:16.386
that, you know, you start to i it's meaningful

1537
01:20:16.395 --> 01:20:18.375
to ask that question, are they starting to show

1538
01:20:18.386 --> 01:20:21.775
some sort of agency? But in general, you only

1539
01:20:21.786 --> 01:20:24.016
will find that in something that has the internal

1540
01:20:24.025 --> 01:20:27.145
complexity of something like a cell. So that's where

1541
01:20:27.155 --> 01:20:29.895
I again, where I feel agency as well as

1542
01:20:29.905 --> 01:20:32.476
actual life really begins.

1543
01:20:33.509 --> 01:20:35.790
So in your book, at a certain point, you

1544
01:20:35.799 --> 01:20:41.089
also talk about and comment on medical approaches to

1545
01:20:41.100 --> 01:20:43.729
biology. So could you tell us a little bit

1546
01:20:43.740 --> 01:20:46.770
about that? And when it comes to the sort

1547
01:20:46.779 --> 01:20:50.669
of paradigm that is the most dominant nowadays in

1548
01:20:50.890 --> 01:20:53.930
medicine, what do you think about it?

1549
01:20:54.560 --> 01:20:59.779
Well, I think one of the me messages for

1550
01:20:59.790 --> 01:21:03.879
medicine that might come out of uh the kinds

1551
01:21:03.890 --> 01:21:07.959
of things I consider in the book is because

1552
01:21:07.970 --> 01:21:11.310
of these um this hierarchy of, of, of, of

1553
01:21:11.319 --> 01:21:13.770
levels in the way life works, each of which

1554
01:21:13.779 --> 01:21:16.669
has some degree of autonomy, some degree of independence

1555
01:21:16.680 --> 01:21:18.959
from the details of what's happening at the lower

1556
01:21:18.970 --> 01:21:23.270
levels. What that really means is there's a um

1557
01:21:23.279 --> 01:21:26.850
the, the causation what is really causing if you

1558
01:21:26.859 --> 01:21:28.910
like, um you know, if you're thinking about the,

1559
01:21:28.919 --> 01:21:32.549
the, the, the shape, the structure, the behavior of

1560
01:21:32.560 --> 01:21:35.839
the whole system, what is really causing that it

1561
01:21:35.850 --> 01:21:40.200
might arise at several, many perhaps any of those

1562
01:21:40.209 --> 01:21:43.910
levels. It's not a cause that's all determined at

1563
01:21:43.919 --> 01:21:47.029
the genetic level. Some things are. And if we're

1564
01:21:47.040 --> 01:21:49.490
thinking now about disease, if we think about something

1565
01:21:49.500 --> 01:21:52.490
like cystic fibrosis, um you know, there is a

1566
01:21:52.500 --> 01:21:57.680
particular gene where there are several uh mutant varieties

1567
01:21:57.689 --> 01:22:00.804
of that gene that some people inherit. And, you

1568
01:22:00.813 --> 01:22:03.604
know, if you have them, then you ha are,

1569
01:22:03.613 --> 01:22:08.124
are likely to get cystic fibrosis. Um Not actually

1570
01:22:08.133 --> 01:22:11.983
completely, you know, it doesn't, it doesn't necessarily do

1571
01:22:11.994 --> 01:22:14.414
you to having that. It depends, there's still some

1572
01:22:14.423 --> 01:22:17.784
dependence on higher levels that can compensate. But, you

1573
01:22:17.793 --> 01:22:20.363
know, if you have cystic fibrosis, you pretty much

1574
01:22:20.374 --> 01:22:23.903
certainly have one of these gene variants. Um So

1575
01:22:23.914 --> 01:22:26.467
in that case, it's meaningful to, I think of

1576
01:22:26.478 --> 01:22:29.998
that gene as being a, a real cause of

1577
01:22:30.007 --> 01:22:33.217
the disease. But many other diseases, you know, because

1578
01:22:33.228 --> 01:22:35.198
I talked about the, the, the way that our

1579
01:22:35.208 --> 01:22:38.808
traits are spread throughout the genome. So the common,

1580
01:22:39.098 --> 01:22:41.368
you know, the most common diseases that we face

1581
01:22:41.377 --> 01:22:44.167
things like, you know, heart disease, um and or

1582
01:22:44.178 --> 01:22:49.198
cardiovascular problems, generally, um obesity, diabetes, um they, you

1583
01:22:49.208 --> 01:22:53.032
know, they're spread throughout the genome. And so causation

1584
01:22:53.041 --> 01:22:55.762
can't in any meaningful sense, certainly be ascribed to

1585
01:22:55.771 --> 01:22:58.291
a single gene. But I think it can't really

1586
01:22:58.301 --> 01:23:01.512
be ascribed to the, the genome itself. It's things

1587
01:23:01.521 --> 01:23:04.932
that are happening at the physiological level that, you

1588
01:23:04.941 --> 01:23:09.091
know, are being um affected by, by genetics. But

1589
01:23:09.102 --> 01:23:11.742
the causation is perhaps happening at a, at a

1590
01:23:11.751 --> 01:23:15.591
higher level. If we think about COVID, for example,

1591
01:23:15.731 --> 01:23:19.556
the, the people who had serious reactions to a

1592
01:23:19.565 --> 01:23:22.275
CO uh to an infection by the COVID virus.

1593
01:23:22.425 --> 01:23:24.456
And, you know, the PE many of the people

1594
01:23:24.465 --> 01:23:28.016
who died from it, um, that the, the, the,

1595
01:23:28.025 --> 01:23:30.855
the problem there was how their immune system was

1596
01:23:30.866 --> 01:23:32.925
responding, that it was a sort of a often

1597
01:23:32.936 --> 01:23:35.175
an over response of the immune system that caused

1598
01:23:35.186 --> 01:23:39.085
all kinds of, um, problems with tissues. Um, uh

1599
01:23:39.186 --> 01:23:43.390
ALL kinds of respiratory problems. Um, IT seems that

1600
01:23:43.399 --> 01:23:45.459
there is, you know, that there is a genetic

1601
01:23:45.470 --> 01:23:48.160
aspect to that propensity and we're only starting to

1602
01:23:48.169 --> 01:23:51.399
uncover that now. But really the causative um uh

1603
01:23:51.410 --> 01:23:54.990
level of the problem there was at the level

1604
01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:58.060
of the immune system. And so that was where,

1605
01:23:58.069 --> 01:24:01.060
you know, often we, we uh tried to intervene

1606
01:24:01.069 --> 01:24:03.060
that some of the drugs that were most useful

1607
01:24:03.069 --> 01:24:07.100
were anti inflammatories that calmed down the immune system.

1608
01:24:07.379 --> 01:24:09.580
And this is the general message then the of,

1609
01:24:09.589 --> 01:24:11.759
of the book that really if we have this

1610
01:24:11.770 --> 01:24:16.229
multilevel causation in biology, if we're wanting to put

1611
01:24:16.240 --> 01:24:18.560
something right, that has gone wrong at the level

1612
01:24:18.569 --> 01:24:20.560
of the organism, at the level of the body,

1613
01:24:20.569 --> 01:24:24.370
then it makes sense to try to identify, you

1614
01:24:24.379 --> 01:24:28.839
know, where is th th the primary causation arising

1615
01:24:28.850 --> 01:24:34.680
for this particular condition? Um So the, the predominant

1616
01:24:34.689 --> 01:24:37.669
idea, you know, over, over since the certainly it

1617
01:24:37.680 --> 01:24:40.250
was the human genome project was partly predicated on

1618
01:24:40.259 --> 01:24:42.549
this. Once we understand the genome, we'll be able

1619
01:24:42.560 --> 01:24:45.149
to figure out which genes are responsible for pretty

1620
01:24:45.160 --> 01:24:46.970
much any disease. And we can go in and

1621
01:24:46.979 --> 01:24:48.990
do you know, do something about it. But if

1622
01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:52.310
causation is not rooted in the genes, that's not

1623
01:24:52.319 --> 01:24:54.430
gonna be very useful. And that's, you know, we've

1624
01:24:54.439 --> 01:24:57.740
seen that, uh, it's, the genome project has been

1625
01:24:57.750 --> 01:25:00.700
fantastically useful as a resource for all sorts of

1626
01:25:00.709 --> 01:25:04.549
reasons. Um, PARTICULARLY for identifying people who might have

1627
01:25:04.560 --> 01:25:08.020
a genetic propensity or vulnerability to disease. But it

1628
01:25:08.029 --> 01:25:12.899
has produced really very few actual cures because that's,

1629
01:25:12.910 --> 01:25:15.529
you know, perhaps not the, the level at which

1630
01:25:15.879 --> 01:25:19.729
cure will be, will, will be found. So uh

1631
01:25:19.740 --> 01:25:23.020
um that, you know, that's that, that's really um

1632
01:25:23.029 --> 01:25:25.620
the, the, the general message that and, and I

1633
01:25:25.629 --> 01:25:29.399
think that's particularly been been uh notable in cancer.

1634
01:25:29.410 --> 01:25:31.660
And there are many people now saying we've had

1635
01:25:31.669 --> 01:25:33.890
years of, you know, ID, the of, of this

1636
01:25:33.899 --> 01:25:36.299
notion that we identify the cancer genes and that

1637
01:25:36.404 --> 01:25:39.205
allow us to stop cancer and it hasn't worked

1638
01:25:39.345 --> 01:25:42.265
and maybe we need to rethink it. And perhaps

1639
01:25:42.274 --> 01:25:45.294
part of that rethinking is to think about cancer

1640
01:25:45.305 --> 01:25:48.024
more at the systemic level, more at perhaps the

1641
01:25:48.035 --> 01:25:50.674
level of a dysfunction of cells or even of

1642
01:25:50.685 --> 01:25:53.745
tissues rather than of genes.

1643
01:25:54.529 --> 01:25:57.549
So if I understand it correctly, then the main

1644
01:25:57.560 --> 01:26:02.790
proposal here for uh doctors for researchers in medicine

1645
01:26:02.799 --> 01:26:05.870
would be for them to reframe the way they

1646
01:26:05.879 --> 01:26:09.419
think about causation in disease or

1647
01:26:09.430 --> 01:26:12.089
not. Iii I think so. And I, you know,

1648
01:26:12.100 --> 01:26:13.959
I wouldn't want to claim that this is some

1649
01:26:13.970 --> 01:26:16.009
bold idea that I've come up with that I

1650
01:26:16.060 --> 01:26:19.750
sort of me to say that they, um, I

1651
01:26:19.759 --> 01:26:22.963
think that this is something that actually, um, people

1652
01:26:22.974 --> 01:26:26.043
are expressing more and more, you know, anyway, I

1653
01:26:26.054 --> 01:26:28.014
mean, as I say, in particular, in the case

1654
01:26:28.023 --> 01:26:31.213
of cancer where the, you know, genetic approaches have

1655
01:26:31.224 --> 01:26:34.034
been really frankly so disappointing. I mean, you know,

1656
01:26:34.043 --> 01:26:37.233
I talked earlier about having had cancer myself, prostate

1657
01:26:37.244 --> 01:26:41.494
cancer, um, recently and it's a stark reminder of

1658
01:26:41.503 --> 01:26:45.034
how we actually generally deal with cancer still, which

1659
01:26:45.043 --> 01:26:48.344
is, you know, high tech medieval really that it's,

1660
01:26:48.354 --> 01:26:50.257
um, in my, you know, a robot goes in

1661
01:26:50.268 --> 01:26:52.518
and performs surgery, it cuts out the bit that

1662
01:26:52.527 --> 01:26:56.058
has the cancer in. And, you know, it's fantastic

1663
01:26:56.067 --> 01:26:58.317
that it, that it works, it can work and

1664
01:26:58.328 --> 01:27:00.757
that, you know, it worked in my case. Um,

1665
01:27:00.768 --> 01:27:03.208
BUT, you know, that's still the level that we're

1666
01:27:03.217 --> 01:27:05.527
at, we just cut it out or we pump

1667
01:27:05.538 --> 01:27:08.237
ourselves full of, you know, toxic stuff and hope

1668
01:27:08.248 --> 01:27:10.717
that it kills the cancer cells faster than it

1669
01:27:10.728 --> 01:27:13.518
kills all our heal healthy cells. So we still,

1670
01:27:13.527 --> 01:27:17.041
uh, you know, generally relying on these crude methods

1671
01:27:17.051 --> 01:27:20.551
rather than anything, you know, finely sort of targeted

1672
01:27:20.562 --> 01:27:24.742
at particular genes. Um So I think we're already

1673
01:27:24.751 --> 01:27:28.651
discovering, you know, we're already realizing that that actually

1674
01:27:28.662 --> 01:27:30.341
that we, we, you know, we need to take

1675
01:27:30.352 --> 01:27:32.881
this broader view of medicine than just sort of

1676
01:27:32.892 --> 01:27:35.821
thinking that you can address everything at the genetic

1677
01:27:35.832 --> 01:27:39.341
level. And, you know, again, thinking about cancer. The

1678
01:27:39.352 --> 01:27:42.722
immune system seems to be a conduit for all

1679
01:27:42.731 --> 01:27:45.056
kinds of, it's hardly a disease that we know

1680
01:27:45.065 --> 01:27:47.496
of that doesn't involve the immune system in some

1681
01:27:47.505 --> 01:27:50.306
way. And it's really striking that the immune system

1682
01:27:50.315 --> 01:27:53.726
is now one of the areas that we're targeting

1683
01:27:53.735 --> 01:27:57.666
for dealing with cancer, uh, you know, immunotherapy, um,

1684
01:27:57.675 --> 01:28:01.025
is very, uh, uh, uh, effective for particular types

1685
01:28:01.036 --> 01:28:03.005
of cancer. It doesn't work by any means for

1686
01:28:03.016 --> 01:28:05.326
all cancers. But for some, it seems to show

1687
01:28:05.335 --> 01:28:08.025
a great deal of promise to sort of supercharge

1688
01:28:08.036 --> 01:28:11.080
our immune system to, to deal with the cancer.

1689
01:28:11.160 --> 01:28:13.209
Um So in a, in a way that's kind

1690
01:28:13.220 --> 01:28:16.709
of helping the body at the right level to

1691
01:28:16.720 --> 01:28:20.129
deal um with the problem itself rather than us

1692
01:28:20.140 --> 01:28:21.700
kind of going in there and trying to do

1693
01:28:21.709 --> 01:28:23.750
microsurgery on genes.

1694
01:28:24.370 --> 01:28:28.200
But, but going back to when we talked about

1695
01:28:28.209 --> 01:28:33.049
our context is so important to understand how life

1696
01:28:33.060 --> 01:28:38.333
works. In the case of, for example, uh breathing

1697
01:28:38.344 --> 01:28:42.854
and treating cancers, don't you think that perhaps we

1698
01:28:42.863 --> 01:28:47.304
should need more personalized medicine here? Because it's not

1699
01:28:47.313 --> 01:28:51.813
just that every cancer is different from the others.

1700
01:28:51.824 --> 01:28:55.934
But also I would imagine that in different people,

1701
01:28:55.943 --> 01:29:00.333
even the same type of cancer would be different.

1702
01:29:00.523 --> 01:29:03.613
Right? Yeah, absolutely. And I, you know, I think

1703
01:29:03.624 --> 01:29:07.370
that, that um that's the kind of personalized medicine

1704
01:29:07.379 --> 01:29:09.709
that I think really does hold a lot of

1705
01:29:09.720 --> 01:29:12.910
promise. Um BECAUSE a, as you say, um it's

1706
01:29:12.919 --> 01:29:15.740
now recognized because we have the techniques to look

1707
01:29:15.750 --> 01:29:18.660
in detail at cancers. It's now recognized that in

1708
01:29:18.669 --> 01:29:21.109
a sense, every cancer is individual and it's not

1709
01:29:21.120 --> 01:29:25.370
just um you know, uh uh uh cells proliferating

1710
01:29:25.379 --> 01:29:28.680
sort of wildly and indiscriminately actually, a lot of

1711
01:29:28.689 --> 01:29:32.064
tumors look more like. Uh uh I, I um

1712
01:29:32.075 --> 01:29:34.035
quoted in the book, I think um that it's

1713
01:29:34.044 --> 01:29:38.464
like a deranged development that actually they're, they have

1714
01:29:38.475 --> 01:29:41.575
different types of cell within the tumor, different types

1715
01:29:41.584 --> 01:29:43.904
of cancer cell that look like, you know, they,

1716
01:29:43.915 --> 01:29:46.435
they're differentiating in much the same way that they

1717
01:29:46.444 --> 01:29:50.970
do in, in normal development. Um And you know,

1718
01:29:50.979 --> 01:29:54.250
to, to, I, if we understand what different types

1719
01:29:54.259 --> 01:29:57.129
of cell are in a particular tumor, we can

1720
01:29:57.140 --> 01:30:01.290
then uh quite possibly target that tumor with the

1721
01:30:01.299 --> 01:30:03.549
right kind of treatment, the right kind of drugs

1722
01:30:03.560 --> 01:30:06.560
for that particular tumor. And even as you say,

1723
01:30:06.569 --> 01:30:09.020
in, in a single person, you know, one tumor

1724
01:30:09.029 --> 01:30:12.180
might not be the same as, as another. So,

1725
01:30:12.189 --> 01:30:14.350
ab absolutely. And I think, you know, that's one

1726
01:30:14.359 --> 01:30:19.859
area where being able to um genetically uh analyze

1727
01:30:19.870 --> 01:30:22.740
the cells that are in a tumor is absolutely

1728
01:30:22.750 --> 01:30:25.640
valuable that tells you that's really valuable information for

1729
01:30:25.649 --> 01:30:27.490
the types of cell it is and the types

1730
01:30:27.500 --> 01:30:30.750
of treatment that it might respond to. Um And

1731
01:30:30.759 --> 01:30:33.089
I think it's, it's, it's very striking that, you

1732
01:30:33.100 --> 01:30:35.529
know what a lot of people who've talk, who

1733
01:30:35.540 --> 01:30:39.009
are talking about personalized medicine. Now, we, we've got

1734
01:30:39.020 --> 01:30:41.500
this idea. Uh I think often sort of pushed

1735
01:30:41.509 --> 01:30:43.080
to us. So what that means is we'll have

1736
01:30:43.089 --> 01:30:45.430
our genomes profiled and then our genomes will tell

1737
01:30:45.439 --> 01:30:49.140
us what, you know, treatments are best for us,

1738
01:30:49.200 --> 01:30:51.459
that there might be some degree that that will

1739
01:30:51.470 --> 01:30:53.939
happen. But I think people generally now in personalized

1740
01:30:53.950 --> 01:30:57.509
medicine recognize this hierarchy of levels. And that actually

1741
01:30:57.520 --> 01:30:59.390
what we also need to do is to be

1742
01:30:59.399 --> 01:31:02.919
profiling ourselves at the tissue level, at the cell

1743
01:31:02.930 --> 01:31:06.950
level, at the physiological level. Um TO understand, you

1744
01:31:06.959 --> 01:31:09.109
know, what treatment is going to be best for

1745
01:31:09.120 --> 01:31:12.720
the individual. So, personalized medicine is coming round to

1746
01:31:12.729 --> 01:31:16.359
this a kind of holistic picture. I think of

1747
01:31:16.370 --> 01:31:20.040
understanding the b you know, biology, understanding how life

1748
01:31:20.049 --> 01:31:23.319
works at all these different levels so that we

1749
01:31:23.330 --> 01:31:26.169
can best understand how to, how to intervene for

1750
01:31:26.180 --> 01:31:27.259
an individual.

1751
01:31:28.200 --> 01:31:31.819
So one last topic then toward the end of

1752
01:31:31.830 --> 01:31:36.259
your book, you go beyond talking about how life

1753
01:31:36.270 --> 01:31:40.779
works and you also talk about redesigning life. So

1754
01:31:41.040 --> 01:31:46.540
as we accumulate knowledge about how life works, what

1755
01:31:46.549 --> 01:31:48.680
do you think would be some of the main

1756
01:31:48.689 --> 01:31:51.649
ways we could redesign life?

1757
01:31:52.129 --> 01:31:54.299
Well, I I've talked uh touched on one of

1758
01:31:54.310 --> 01:31:57.569
them already, which is this notion of cell reprogramming

1759
01:31:57.580 --> 01:32:02.799
for, you know, tissue regener regeneration. And uh one

1760
01:32:02.810 --> 01:32:05.910
way in which that's developing is that I, you

1761
01:32:05.919 --> 01:32:08.220
know, I said when I had my uh skin

1762
01:32:08.229 --> 01:32:10.850
cells reprogrammed to neurons, they started making something that

1763
01:32:10.859 --> 01:32:12.669
looked a little bit like a sort of brain

1764
01:32:12.680 --> 01:32:16.109
like structure. That's a structure called an organoid. So

1765
01:32:16.120 --> 01:32:18.370
it's grown in a dish and you know, it

1766
01:32:18.379 --> 01:32:21.689
starts to in some crude way to resemble a

1767
01:32:21.700 --> 01:32:26.270
sort of embryonic brain. If you program the reprogram,

1768
01:32:26.279 --> 01:32:28.759
the cells not to become neurons, but uh to

1769
01:32:28.770 --> 01:32:31.839
become some other tissue type, then they start to

1770
01:32:31.850 --> 01:32:35.000
assemble into structures that look a bit like the

1771
01:32:35.009 --> 01:32:38.979
respective organ. If you program them to become like

1772
01:32:38.990 --> 01:32:41.959
the epithelium of the gut, they start to make,

1773
01:32:41.970 --> 01:32:44.089
you know, a tube like gut like structure with

1774
01:32:44.100 --> 01:32:46.169
all these little sort of protrusions that we have

1775
01:32:46.180 --> 01:32:48.709
in our gut. Um You know, if you make

1776
01:32:48.720 --> 01:32:52.109
them into uh uh pancreatic cells, they will start

1777
01:32:52.120 --> 01:32:55.620
to become like a little pancreas. Um So uh

1778
01:32:55.629 --> 01:32:59.140
these uh so called organoids, they can be used.

1779
01:32:59.149 --> 01:33:02.220
Um They can be used as models to understand

1780
01:33:02.229 --> 01:33:05.299
uh um to, to, to, you know, as to,

1781
01:33:05.310 --> 01:33:08.930
to fundamentally investigate um the the the structure and

1782
01:33:08.939 --> 01:33:11.540
the properties and how these organs will respond to

1783
01:33:11.549 --> 01:33:14.339
particular treatments. So they can help us understand the

1784
01:33:14.350 --> 01:33:18.569
development process in a dish. Um But you know,

1785
01:33:18.580 --> 01:33:22.370
they can also be potentially grown into structures that

1786
01:33:22.379 --> 01:33:24.379
could be used to, to that could be re

1787
01:33:24.390 --> 01:33:27.209
implanted in the body. So people are interested in,

1788
01:33:27.220 --> 01:33:31.399
for example, repairing neural damage by growing neural structures

1789
01:33:31.410 --> 01:33:33.930
in a dish and then perhaps re implanting that

1790
01:33:33.939 --> 01:33:36.689
neural tissue into the body or or you know,

1791
01:33:36.700 --> 01:33:39.629
doing that with muscle or whatever. And there are,

1792
01:33:39.640 --> 01:33:42.330
you know, approaches that are starting to uh to,

1793
01:33:42.339 --> 01:33:45.029
to pay off um in this way, or we

1794
01:33:45.040 --> 01:33:47.850
can, in some cases, we can think about reprogramming

1795
01:33:47.859 --> 01:33:51.290
cells directly within the body rather than having to

1796
01:33:51.299 --> 01:33:53.000
take them out and grow them in a dish.

1797
01:33:53.020 --> 01:33:55.669
There are complications to that process, but in some

1798
01:33:55.680 --> 01:33:58.540
ways that can be, there are also advantages, you

1799
01:33:58.549 --> 01:34:00.859
know, you you want, if you're regrowing neural tissue,

1800
01:34:00.870 --> 01:34:03.470
you want it to be integrated into the neurons

1801
01:34:03.479 --> 01:34:05.649
that are already there, which can happen much more

1802
01:34:05.660 --> 01:34:08.419
easily if it's growing in city rather than grown

1803
01:34:08.430 --> 01:34:11.459
in addition, and sort of grafted back in. So,

1804
01:34:11.470 --> 01:34:14.569
you know, those sorts of possibilities are, are really

1805
01:34:14.580 --> 01:34:18.970
um extraordinary for regenerative medicine. But beyond that, I

1806
01:34:18.979 --> 01:34:23.250
think once we uh uh uh start to, to,

1807
01:34:23.259 --> 01:34:27.200
to recognize how the developmental process really goes on

1808
01:34:27.209 --> 01:34:30.529
and how cells acquire fate and communicate with each

1809
01:34:30.540 --> 01:34:34.779
other, it opens up questions that almost seem verging

1810
01:34:34.790 --> 01:34:37.959
on the philosophical of, well, what does that mean

1811
01:34:37.970 --> 01:34:41.950
about the, the, the the range of different morphologies

1812
01:34:41.959 --> 01:34:45.160
that the human body could have or that tissues

1813
01:34:45.169 --> 01:34:48.620
generally could have? You can ask questions like well,

1814
01:34:48.770 --> 01:34:52.600
could there be states that cells could form because

1815
01:34:52.609 --> 01:34:55.029
they're, you know, these incredibly complex systems with, you

1816
01:34:55.040 --> 01:34:58.490
know, thousands of different proteins, but they only form

1817
01:34:58.500 --> 01:35:01.259
a limited number of tissues in our body. It

1818
01:35:01.270 --> 01:35:04.009
seems unlikely that those are the only things cells

1819
01:35:04.020 --> 01:35:06.779
could form. Could there be tissue types that have

1820
01:35:06.790 --> 01:35:08.770
not, that don't appear in our body? But that

1821
01:35:08.779 --> 01:35:11.580
could actually be useful. Could actually, you know, do

1822
01:35:11.589 --> 01:35:15.129
something. Um Could they grow into d could we

1823
01:35:15.140 --> 01:35:18.049
program cells to grow into different shapes? Can we

1824
01:35:18.060 --> 01:35:22.970
understand these, these developmental processes? Well enough that we

1825
01:35:22.979 --> 01:35:25.810
can make not just a uh a little organoid

1826
01:35:25.819 --> 01:35:28.770
but actually a group of different organoids that, you

1827
01:35:28.779 --> 01:35:32.589
know, start communicating with one another like a system

1828
01:35:32.600 --> 01:35:35.450
of organs. I mean, you know, once you start

1829
01:35:35.459 --> 01:35:39.196
thinking about down this line, the possibilities become mind

1830
01:35:39.227 --> 01:35:41.907
boggling and also potentially grotesque, you know, could you

1831
01:35:41.916 --> 01:35:45.307
grow a kind of new sort of organ or

1832
01:35:45.316 --> 01:35:48.867
mini uh sorry new organism or mini organism where,

1833
01:35:48.876 --> 01:35:51.006
you know, several of these organoids have kind of

1834
01:35:51.017 --> 01:35:54.526
wired up. We've already um researchers have already been

1835
01:35:54.537 --> 01:35:57.347
able to wire up a brain organoid to a,

1836
01:35:57.356 --> 01:36:00.466
a bit of muscle tissue so that the um

1837
01:36:00.477 --> 01:36:03.104
the br the signals from the brain can make

1838
01:36:03.113 --> 01:36:06.684
the muscle do things. Um You know, how far

1839
01:36:06.693 --> 01:36:09.374
along those uh lines can we go? What are

1840
01:36:09.383 --> 01:36:12.883
the ethical considerations about that in particular? And you

1841
01:36:12.894 --> 01:36:15.443
know, the particularly when you're thinking about growing brain

1842
01:36:15.454 --> 01:36:19.684
organoids, the more brain like they become the better

1843
01:36:19.693 --> 01:36:22.224
model they are for understanding how the real brain

1844
01:36:22.233 --> 01:36:24.523
works and the bigger they become the better model

1845
01:36:24.534 --> 01:36:26.543
they are. But also the more you have to

1846
01:36:26.554 --> 01:36:28.991
then start thinking, is there some point if we're

1847
01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:31.641
growing them from human cells, some point at which

1848
01:36:31.650 --> 01:36:33.840
we have to start thinking, could this thing be

1849
01:36:33.851 --> 01:36:36.360
conscious? What does that mean? What does it mean

1850
01:36:36.371 --> 01:36:39.280
for a bit of, you know, isolated brain, like

1851
01:36:39.291 --> 01:36:43.641
tissue outside the body to have consciousness? Could it

1852
01:36:43.650 --> 01:36:46.761
in any sense have feeling? We don't know the

1853
01:36:46.770 --> 01:36:49.601
answer to these questions, but we absolutely have to

1854
01:36:49.610 --> 01:36:53.110
ask them once we start growing these things. So

1855
01:36:53.500 --> 01:36:56.520
yeah, in terms of being able to understand and

1856
01:36:56.529 --> 01:37:01.609
control and direct developmental processes, um including ones outside

1857
01:37:01.620 --> 01:37:06.000
the body, you know, incredible possibilities. Um Open up

1858
01:37:06.009 --> 01:37:09.200
for growing new kinds of, you know, living mechanism

1859
01:37:09.209 --> 01:37:12.279
or, you know, p possibly new kinds of, you

1860
01:37:12.290 --> 01:37:17.410
know, organ. Um But with them come some really

1861
01:37:17.419 --> 01:37:21.640
quite tricky ethical uh and also philosophical questions.

1862
01:37:22.580 --> 01:37:25.500
And I would imagine that particularly if in the

1863
01:37:25.509 --> 01:37:29.430
future, we accumulate enough knowledge to be able to

1864
01:37:29.439 --> 01:37:34.319
create completely new life forms that that could also

1865
01:37:34.330 --> 01:37:38.709
raise some ethical questions. Like for example, if we

1866
01:37:38.720 --> 01:37:41.689
were to create a new life form that is

1867
01:37:41.700 --> 01:37:45.790
sentient, then how would we treat it? How would

1868
01:37:45.799 --> 01:37:48.955
we deal with it in what ways would we

1869
01:37:48.964 --> 01:37:52.665
use it if that was the case? And also

1870
01:37:52.714 --> 01:37:55.154
if it was something that we would then be

1871
01:37:55.165 --> 01:37:59.725
releasing into a particular ecosystem, then we should also

1872
01:37:59.734 --> 01:38:03.734
care about how it would interact with other kinds

1873
01:38:03.745 --> 01:38:08.904
of organisms there. It could disrupt the ecosystem.

1874
01:38:09.104 --> 01:38:12.410
Absolutely. Yes. Well, this is already, these are already

1875
01:38:12.419 --> 01:38:15.000
the sorts of questions that people working in synthetic

1876
01:38:15.009 --> 01:38:17.879
biology, you know, have to uh understand and in

1877
01:38:17.890 --> 01:38:21.100
general this idea of synthetic biology of redesigning living

1878
01:38:21.109 --> 01:38:24.750
organisms for particular purposes in general, that's been confined

1879
01:38:24.759 --> 01:38:28.399
to doing things to bacteria because bacteria are simpler

1880
01:38:28.410 --> 01:38:31.089
than us, they're more predictable than us. You know,

1881
01:38:31.100 --> 01:38:34.214
you can insert particular genes into them and we've

1882
01:38:34.225 --> 01:38:36.384
actually been doing this since the 19 seventies to

1883
01:38:36.395 --> 01:38:39.134
get them to make particular chemicals or to, you

1884
01:38:39.145 --> 01:38:41.654
know, alter the ways they, they behave in, in

1885
01:38:41.665 --> 01:38:44.865
quite well defined ways. And there can be fantastic

1886
01:38:44.875 --> 01:38:47.765
uses for this for making new sort of biomaterials

1887
01:38:47.774 --> 01:38:50.354
and so on or perhaps even, you know, programming

1888
01:38:50.365 --> 01:38:54.725
bacteria to a to be environmental remediators to, you

1889
01:38:54.734 --> 01:38:57.729
know, eat up lots of pollution or something. But

1890
01:38:57.740 --> 01:38:59.850
if you do, even at that level, you know,

1891
01:38:59.859 --> 01:39:01.939
you have to start thinking, well, what, what are

1892
01:39:01.950 --> 01:39:05.810
the implications of releasing something engineered like this into

1893
01:39:05.819 --> 01:39:09.390
the natural environment where it can potentially evolve? Um

1894
01:39:09.649 --> 01:39:13.549
But once you start to think about multicellular synthetic

1895
01:39:13.560 --> 01:39:16.410
biology, which is still relatively new because it's much

1896
01:39:16.419 --> 01:39:18.609
harder to do because you then have to think

1897
01:39:18.620 --> 01:39:20.729
about more levels of the hierarchy and you know

1898
01:39:20.740 --> 01:39:24.009
how we can control them then, yeah, these broader

1899
01:39:24.020 --> 01:39:27.009
questions arise and if you're thinking about doing that

1900
01:39:27.020 --> 01:39:30.290
with human cells or for example, with perhaps mixtures

1901
01:39:30.299 --> 01:39:33.330
of human cells and those of other um animals

1902
01:39:33.339 --> 01:39:36.390
or those of other organisms, you know, what, what

1903
01:39:36.399 --> 01:39:39.450
is the nature of the entity that you're creating?

1904
01:39:39.459 --> 01:39:41.450
Is it uh is it in some sense a

1905
01:39:41.459 --> 01:39:43.759
new kind of living entity? What does that mean?

1906
01:39:43.770 --> 01:39:46.970
What are the, you know, safety um considerations and

1907
01:39:46.979 --> 01:39:51.399
so on? So these kinds of um considerations are

1908
01:39:51.410 --> 01:39:53.520
going to become more and more complex. I mean,

1909
01:39:53.529 --> 01:39:55.549
one thing, one area that I just also touch

1910
01:39:55.560 --> 01:39:57.879
on in the book is that in, in um

1911
01:39:57.890 --> 01:40:01.720
understanding Human embryology, we can now create out of

1912
01:40:01.729 --> 01:40:05.870
stem cells structures that look in many respects like

1913
01:40:05.879 --> 01:40:09.399
human embryos that, that, that have not been created

1914
01:40:09.410 --> 01:40:12.189
by any eggs or sperm being involved at all.

1915
01:40:12.200 --> 01:40:15.069
They're just taking stem cells and the stem cells

1916
01:40:15.080 --> 01:40:16.879
would organize themselves if you do it in the

1917
01:40:16.890 --> 01:40:18.359
right way and give them the right sort of

1918
01:40:18.370 --> 01:40:21.529
tissues and nutrients. Um They will organize themselves into

1919
01:40:21.540 --> 01:40:24.229
something that looks like a human embryo. And that

1920
01:40:24.240 --> 01:40:27.140
can be really useful as a kind of whole

1921
01:40:27.200 --> 01:40:31.310
embryo organoid, really for understanding development. But of course,

1922
01:40:31.319 --> 01:40:34.560
the ethical questions there become even more profound and

1923
01:40:34.569 --> 01:40:36.859
you know, should we treat it as we do

1924
01:40:36.870 --> 01:40:39.709
human embryo, actual human embryos with the same kind

1925
01:40:39.720 --> 01:40:42.240
of, you know, rules governing what can be done?

1926
01:40:42.250 --> 01:40:44.029
Or is it a different sort? Is it a,

1927
01:40:44.040 --> 01:40:46.470
you know, tissue culture, is it a different sort

1928
01:40:46.479 --> 01:40:49.319
of organism? Really? We don't know the answer to

1929
01:40:49.330 --> 01:40:51.919
these things, but they're ones that people are now

1930
01:40:51.930 --> 01:40:54.040
having to really sort of grapple with.

1931
01:40:54.580 --> 01:40:58.839
Mhm. Ok. So let's wrap up the interview here.

1932
01:40:58.850 --> 01:41:01.759
The book is again how life works. The user's

1933
01:41:01.770 --> 01:41:04.709
guide to the new biology. I'm leaving a link

1934
01:41:04.720 --> 01:41:08.640
it in the description down below. And Doctor Ball,

1935
01:41:08.649 --> 01:41:10.959
would you like to tell people again where they

1936
01:41:10.970 --> 01:41:13.600
can find you when you work on the internet?

1937
01:41:14.080 --> 01:41:16.370
Uh Well, yes, I guess you can, I mean,

1938
01:41:16.379 --> 01:41:18.649
I have a uh, a AAA website which I

1939
01:41:18.660 --> 01:41:21.549
guess you can put up Ricardo www dot Flip

1940
01:41:21.629 --> 01:41:27.979
o.co.uk. Um, Google Me and you'll probably find me.

1941
01:41:28.029 --> 01:41:30.029
And, yeah, a full list of my books is

1942
01:41:30.040 --> 01:41:31.479
on that, on that website.

1943
01:41:32.020 --> 01:41:35.470
By the way, could we expect a new book

1944
01:41:35.479 --> 01:41:37.810
somewhere in the future or?

1945
01:41:37.819 --> 01:41:41.319
Uh, YES, inevitably, I guess, um, I'm not gonna

1946
01:41:41.330 --> 01:41:44.359
say too much about the, um, I, I have

1947
01:41:44.370 --> 01:41:46.950
to admit rather guiltily I'm working on in one

1948
01:41:46.959 --> 01:41:48.939
way or another on three books at the moment.

1949
01:41:49.149 --> 01:41:51.759
Um, AND I'm not gonna say too much about

1950
01:41:51.770 --> 01:41:54.129
them or, uh, except that they're underway for one

1951
01:41:54.140 --> 01:41:56.450
which is going to be published, I think. Um,

1952
01:41:56.459 --> 01:41:59.830
HOPEFULLY later this year. Um, AND it's an Illustrated

1953
01:41:59.839 --> 01:42:02.799
history of alchemy. Um, IT'S, it's working with a

1954
01:42:02.810 --> 01:42:06.509
publisher who produces beautiful illustrated books that, that I've

1955
01:42:06.520 --> 01:42:09.240
done a couple before with them. They always look

1956
01:42:09.250 --> 01:42:13.359
fantastic. And, uh it's so, yes, that's basically what

1957
01:42:13.370 --> 01:42:17.049
it's about. It's trying to reposition the way we

1958
01:42:17.060 --> 01:42:20.470
think about alchemy as something that's not just, you

1959
01:42:20.479 --> 01:42:23.040
know, uh uh some kind of weird superstition but

1960
01:42:23.049 --> 01:42:25.379
is actually uh an important part of the history

1961
01:42:25.390 --> 01:42:26.040
of science.

1962
01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:29.939
Great. So I'm very much looking forward to it

1963
01:42:29.950 --> 01:42:32.379
and thank you so much again for taking the

1964
