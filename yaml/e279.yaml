  \ II Professor of Biological Sciences, Professor of Human Evolutionary Biology at\
  \ Harvard University. He studies and teaches how and why the human body looks and\
  \ functions the way it does. He started his career studying the evolution of the\
  \ human head, but is now more focused on the evolution of human physical activity,\

  \  He\u2019s the author of the books The Evolution of the Human Head, and The Story\
  \ of the Human Body: Evolution, Health, and Disease.\n\nIn this episode, the focus\
  \ of our conversation is the evolution of human bipedalism. We talk about the evolutionary\
  \ pressures behind it, the advantages it conferred to humans, the new challenges\
  \ that it posed, and endurance running. In the second part of the interview, we\
  \ talk about evolutionary mismatch, and the types of problems that we exposed our\
  \ bodies to since the agricultural revolution, and the solutions we can develop.\n\
