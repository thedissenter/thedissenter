shownotes: "Dr. Adaner Usmani is Assistant Professor of Sociology and Social Studies\
  \ at Harvard University. His research is driven by two questions: Why do some people\
  \ flourish while others suffer? And, what explains why, in some places but not others,\
  \ movements or policies emerge to challenge or moderate this inequality? In one\
  \ project, he explores when and why ordinary individuals manage to coordinate collective\
  \ action, and how well these patterns explain the forward march of democracy and\
  \ the extent of economic redistribution.\n\nIn this episode, we focus on topics\
  \ like mass incarceration, discrimination against black Americans and the root causes\
  \ of their subordination, modern democracies and their weaknesses, creating a Left\
  \ that does not deny human nature, and the viability of communism in current political\
  \ systems. We discuss the causes and motivations behind mass incarceration in the\
  \ US. We talk about the contentious issue of high crime rates in black communities,\
  \ and the causes behind them. We address the narrative of the destruction of the\
  \ nuclear family and a culture that go against personal responsibility, coming from\
  \ the conservatives. We talk about praise and blame. We discuss modern democracies,\
  \ the major threats to democracy, the democracies that distribute power among their\
  \ citizens, and the ones that withhold it. And we also discuss political struggle\
  \ and communism. And, finally, we talk about the need to include biology in sociological\
  \ analyses, and about a potential biologically-informed Left.\n\nTime Links:  \n\
