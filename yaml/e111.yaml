  \ of Mental Depth and The Improvised Mind\u201D.  \nIn this episode, the conversation\
  \ revolves around the main topics of Dr. Chater\u2019s book, The Mind is Flat. We\
  \ talk about the many illusions that compose our minds, from the way we interpret\
  \ other people\u2019s behavior and our own, to the attribution of desires, motivations\
  \ and goals to it. We also discuss how our cognition works, and how our perceptual\
  \ systems process information. Other topics include the lack of correspondence between\
  \ our representations and the things outside in the world; how we interpret emotions;\
  \ the issue about preferences and personality; why we still need our mental illusions\
  \ to function properly; and if AI systems can also acquire them, namely emotions\
  \ and consciousness.\n\nTime Links:  \n01:06  The basic premise of \u201CThe Mind\
  \ is Flat\u201D  \n05:33  We are like fictional characters                    \n\
  09:59  The problem with stories and narratives                \n13:58  The illusions\
  \ our minds create (about motives, desires, goals, etc.)            \n17:44  The\
  \ distinction between the conscious mind and brain activity             \n22:34\
  \  Does dualism make sense?    \n27:11  Is modularity of mind a useful approach?\
  \  \n31:21  How our perceptual systems work    \n41:49  How we represent things\
  \ in our minds   \n44:57  The Kuleshov effect, and the interpretation of emotions\
  \      \n52:05  About preferences and personality  \n55:42  Why do we need our mental\
  \ illusions?  \n59:10  The importance of our imagination  \n1:01:31  Can AI systems\
  \ produce the same illusions (emotions, consciousness)?  \n1:04:53  Follow Dr. Chater\u2019\
