shownotes: "RECORDED ON MAY 15th 2023.  \nDr. Ursula Goodenough is a Professor of\
  \ Biology Emerita at Washington University in St. Louis where she engaged in research\
  \ on eukaryotic algae. She has presented the paradigm of Religious Naturalism and\
  \ the Epic of Evolution in numerous venues around the world. She currently serves\
  \ as president of the Religious Naturalist Association. She is the author of The\
  \ Sacred Depths of Nature: How Life Has Emerged and Evolved.\n\nIn this episode,\
  \ we focus on The Sacred Depths of Nature. We talk about \u201Cwhy\u201D questions\
  \ surrounding existence, meaning, purpose, and developing a sense of mystery. We\
  \ go through topics in evolutionary biology, like the origins of life; biochemistry\
  \ and emergence; the self; the origins of evolution and biodiversity; the evolution\
  \ of multicellular organisms; sexual reproduction, and the evolution of nurture;\
  \ and death. We discuss the tenets of Religious Naturalism, and the intellectual\
  \ schism between religion and science. We talk about the existential, spiritual,\
  \ and moral domains of Religious Naturalism. We discuss how it deals with traditional\
  \ religions, how science can elicit religious-like responses from people, and the\
  \ risk of nihilism.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:00 Intro  \n00:58  Meaning, purpose, and\
