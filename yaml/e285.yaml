  \ of a Good Society.\n\nIn this episode, we focus on his most recent book, Blueprint.\
  \ We talk about the human social suite, and human universals and variation across\
  \ societies. We also refer to our tribal aspects, and how that might present some\
  \ obstacles in expanding our societies further. We discuss natural experiments,\
  \ focusing on intentional communities, and how important it is to respect individual\
  \ variation. Finally, we talk about how we can address the current problem of political\
  \ polarization.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:47  The social suite  \n04:26  About human\
