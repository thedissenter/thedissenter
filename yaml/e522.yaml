  \ we talk about female friendships, stereotypes and prejudice, and religion and\
  \ monogamy. We first get into the evolution of female sociality, and how female\
  \ establish friendships among themselves. We talk about aggression in friendships,\
  \ and social factors that influence levels of aggression, like economic inequality\
  \ and sex ratios. We discuss the evolutionary bases of stereotypes and prejudice,\
  \ with a focus on the stereotypes people hold about women who have casual sex. Finally,\
  \ we talk about the relationship between preferred mating strategies and religiosity,\
  \ and anti-atheist prejudice.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:00  Intro  \n00:41  The evolution\
