  \ Organization from Lizards to Humans.\n\nIn this episode, we focus on The Evolution\
  \ of Agency. We talk about agency from an evolutionary perspective, focusing on\
  \ the feedback control model of agency, and go through evolutionary history, touching\
  \ on the first animate actors, the first goal-directed agents, the first intentional\
  \ agents, the first rational agents, and the first socially normative agents. We\
  \ talk about some representatives of each of them. We discuss where goals come from,\
  \ the role of emotions, the understanding of agency in animals, social norms, and\
  \ the role of culture in collective agency. We also discuss the aspects of sociality\
  \ that are uniquely human. Finally, we talk about free will.\n\nTime Links:  \n\
