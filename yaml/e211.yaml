  \nIn this episode, I am joined by Dr. Wilson to talk about Epicureanism. We talk\
  \ about its origins; some of its basic tenets, like materialism and atomism; how\
  \ the epicureans thought about perception; and an early form of protodarwinism.\
  \ We also refer to how the European early scientists and Enlightenment philosophers\
  \ got influenced by Epicureanism. In the second part of the conversation, we discuss\
  \ the Epicurean philosophy of life, and in what significant ways it diverged from\
  \ Stoicism. \n\nTime Links:  \n02:13  The origins of Epicureanism  \n05:59  Epicurean\
