excerpt: Dr. J. Michael Bailey is an American psychologist, behavioral geneticist,
  and professor at Northwestern University. His interests include sexual orientation,
  gender nonconformity, sexual arousal, behavior genetics, and evolutionary psychology.
  He maintains that sexual orientation is heavily influenced by biology and male homosexuality
  is most likely inborn. Dr. Bailey wrote The Man Who Would Be Queen, a book intended
  to explain the biology of male sexual orientation and gender to a general audience,
  focusing on gender nonconforming boys, gay men and male-to-female transsexuals.

  \ psychologist, behavioral geneticist, and professor at Northwestern University.\
  \ His interests include sexual orientation, gender nonconformity, sexual arousal,\
  \ behavior genetics, and evolutionary psychology. He maintains that sexual orientation\
  \ is heavily influenced by biology and male homosexuality is most likely inborn.\
  \ Dr. Bailey wrote The Man Who Would Be Queen, a book intended to explain the biology\
  \ of male sexual orientation and gender to a general audience, focusing on gender\
  \ nonconforming boys, gay men and male-to-female transsexuals.\n\nIn this episode,\
  \ we talk about sexual orientation, sexual arousal, gender identity, and transsexualism.\
  \ We start with sexual orientation, the different kinds out there, if it is inborn,\
  \ and if we have already been able to identify brain areas or genes associated with\
  \ it. We discuss sexual arousal, what is it, how it is measured, and femininity-masculinity.\
  \ We also mention the fraternal birth order effect in homosexuality. We talk about\
  \ gender identity and gender nonconformity. We discuss transsexualism and its different\
  \ kinds, including homosexual transexuals and autogynephilic transexuals. We talk\
  \ about gynandromorphophilic men. Finally, we discuss the relationship between behavior\
  \ genetics and evolutionary psychology.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:00 Intro  \n00:35 \
