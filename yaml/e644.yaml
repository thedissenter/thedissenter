  \ in literature and media at Aarhus University. He is the Director of the Recreational\
  \ Fear Lab, and Associate Editor of Evolutionary Studies in Imaginative Culture.\
  \ He studies horror fiction, and is the author of Why Horror Seduces, and A Very\
  \ Nervous Person's Guide to Horror Movies.\n\nIn this episode, we talk about horror\
  \ from an evolutionary perspective. We discuss horror from an evolutionary perspective,\
  \ and the sociocultural factors behind it. We talk about the traits of monsters,\
  \ and the different types of horror. We talk about slasher movies, and apocalyptic\
  \ stories. We get into human universals in horror, what makes for popular monsters,\
  \ and what makes some films \u201Cso-bad-they\u2019re-good\u201D. We discuss the\
  \ relationship between personality traits and art appreciation. We discuss a study\
  \ on the relationship between being morbidly curious and more psychologically resilient\
  \ during the COVID-19 pandemic. Finally, we talk about what an evolutionary approach\
  \ adds to the picture in literary studies.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:00 Intro  \n00:38\
