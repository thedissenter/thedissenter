  \ Carnegie Mellon University. He works on the conceptual and historical foundations\
  \ of humanism. He has published widely on the nature of reason and the teaching\
  \ of wisdom, and written books on critical thinking and the structure of dialogue.\
  \ Dr. Andrew Norman is the former Director of CMU\u2019s Ethics, History and Public\
  \ Policy program, and is interested in constructive engagement with the religious\
  \ and in developing naturalistic alternatives to destructive religious mythologies.\
  \ He speaks regularly on such topics as reason and faith, science and religion,\
  \ the foundations of ethics, and the evolutionary, cultural, and attitudinal roots\
  \ of prosocial behavior. He is the author of Mental Immunity: Infectious Ideas,\
  \ Mind-Parasites, and the Search for a Better Way to Think.\n\nIn this episode,\
  \ we focus on Mental Immunity. We first get into what cognitive immunology is, and\
  \ some aspects of how our cognition works, like epistemic vigilance, and the fact\
  \ that our reasoning functions better in social contexts. We discuss how we determine\
  \ that something is a \u201Cbad idea\u201D. We also discuss what reason is, and\
  \ how we can determine what a \u201Creasonable belief\u201D is. We talk about critical\
  \ thinking, and ideological thinking. We then go into how we can justify holding\
  \ beliefs that are not supported by the evidence, and the psychological benefits\
  \ of \u201Cwrong\u201D beliefs. We talk specifically about religion, the Enlightenment,\
  \ and moral values. Finally, we discuss strategies to improve cognition, both individually\
  \ and collectively, including the concept of \u201Cmind vaccine\u201D and heard\
  \ immunity.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:00 Intro  \n00:45  The idea of cognitive immunology\
