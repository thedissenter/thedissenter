  \ biases, stereotypes, and prejudice. We start by discussing the scientific validity\
  \ of the concept of \u201Cimplicit bias\u201D; the issue with distinguishing implicit\
  \ bias, explicit bias, and overt behavior; how stereotypes affect people\u2019s\
  \ behavior; some interesting approaches to changing people\u2019s stereotypes, and\
  \ prevent discriminatory behavior. In the final segment of the interview, we also\
  \ discuss the science reform movement, and some of the reasons behind the replicability\
  \ crisis in science.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:35  What are implicit biases? And do they\
