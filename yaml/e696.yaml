shownotes: "RECORDED ON JULY 28th 2022.  \nDr. Ryutaro Uchiyama is a Research Fellow\
  \ at Nanyang Technological University, Singapore. His research interests include\
  \ cultural evolution, cognitive plasticity, and developmental psychobiology.\n\n\
  In this episode, we talk about the cultural evolution of genetic heritability. Dr.\
  \ Uchiyama explains the cultural psychobiological framework. We talk about aspects\
  \ of behavior genetics that get reframed in this framework, like heritability, the\
  \ environment, gene-environment interactions, and gene-environment correlations.\
  \ We discuss issues with the generalizability of genetic effects across societies\
  \ and across time, and predicting how heritability should differ between societies,\
  \ between socioeconomic levels, and other groupings within the same society. We\
  \ get into the specific example of IQ and the Flynn effect. We also talk a bit about\
  \ personality variation across societies, and limitations with the Big Five personality\
  \ inventory. \n\nTime Links:  \n00:00 Intro  \n00:46  Cultural psychobiology  \n\
