  \ Evolution and Mechanisms, and The Evolution of Primate Species.  \nIn this episode,\
  \ the conversation revolves around sexual selection in primate species, and human\
  \ universals and the contributions of primatology to a better understanding of human\
  \ behavior. Starting with the conditions to lead to the development of sexual dimorphisms,\
  \ we then move on to talk about intersexual and intrasexual selection; the ecological\
  \ conditions that favor male and female philopatry, that is, for males or females\
  \ to stay in their troops of origin; pair-bonding in animals, and the problem with\
  \ explaining monogamy; how sex ratios influence reproductive strategies; life history,\
  \ and what it tells us about the evolutionary history of a particular species; primatology\
  \ and the study of human universals; the relevance of the unique events in Homo\
  \ sapiens\u2019 evolutionary history; and also the studying of other animal taxa.\
