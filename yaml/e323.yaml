shownotes: "RECORDED ON FEBRUARY 6th, 2020.\n\nDr. Rivka Weinberg is a professor of\
  \ philosophy at Scripps College in Claremont, California. As a philosopher and bioethicist,\
  \ Dr. Weinberg specializes in ethical and metaphysical issues regarding birth, death,\
  \ and meaning. She\u2019s the author of the book The Risk of a Lifetime: How, When,\
  \ and Why Procreation May Be Permissible. \n\nIn this episode, we talk about the\
  \ ethics of procreation. We first discuss antinatalism, and some of its flaws. We\
  \ then get into the ethics of procreation, and go through several different topics,\
  \ like dealing with life as a risk; the justifications people usually give to procreate;\
  \ the Hazmat theory of parental responsibility; when procreation is permissible;\
  \ abortion; adoption; and reproductive technology. Finally, we talk about connections\
  \ between procreative ethics and the ethics of suicide and euthanasia.\n\nTime Links:\
