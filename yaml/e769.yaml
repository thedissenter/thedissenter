shownotes: "RECORDED ON DECEMBER 23rd 2022.  \nDr. Eric Schwitzgebel is Professor\
  \ of Philosophy at the University of California, Riverside. Most of Dr. Schwitzgebel\u2019\
  s research explores connections between empirical psychology and philosophy of mind,\
  \ especially the nature of belief, the inaccuracy of our judgments about our stream\
  \ of conscious experience, and the tenuous relationship between philosophical ethics\
  \ and actual moral behavior. He also works on classical Chinese philosophy and philosophical\
  \ science fiction.\n\nIn this episode, we talk about beliefs, ethics, and psychology.\
  \ We start by defining belief. We discuss if we have accurate views of our own beliefs,\
  \ and if beliefs cause behavior. We talk about how well we really know our own conscious\
  \ experience, and discuss if introspection is reliable. We then discuss if ethics\
  \ professors and more moral than other people, if philosophy classes have any effect\
  \ on the moral behavior of students, and the effects of narrative arguments. We\
  \ also discuss if philosophy has become more welcoming of women in recent decades,\
  \ and the relationship between empirical psychology and philosophy.\n\nTime Links:\
