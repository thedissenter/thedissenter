excerpt: 'Dr. Greg Eghigian is Professor of History at Pennsylvania State University.
  A historian of both the human sciences and modern Europe, he is particularly interested
  in how societies grapple with the questions and problems associated with modernity
  through the vehicles of science, technology, and medicine. His research has largely
  focused on the nature of power and the relationship between the state, science,
  and medicine in understanding and managing things such as disability, deviance,
  criminality, mental illness, and security. And he regularly writes articles and
  present papers on the general history of madness and psychiatry. In recent years,
  his interests have moved into studying the history of supernatural and paranormal
  phenomena. '

  \ at Pennsylvania State University. A historian of both the human sciences and modern\
  \ Europe, he is particularly interested in how societies grapple with the questions\
  \ and problems associated with modernity through the vehicles of science, technology,\
  \ and medicine. His research has largely focused on the nature of power and the\
  \ relationship between the state, science, and medicine in understanding and managing\
  \ things such as disability, deviance, criminality, mental illness, and security.\
  \ And he regularly writes articles and present papers on the general history of\
  \ madness and psychiatry. In recent years, his interests have moved into studying\
  \ the history of supernatural and paranormal phenomena. \n\nIn this episode, we\
  \ talk about the history of mental illness and psychiatry. We discuss how to properly\
  \ address the history of mental illness, and the cultural and political elements\
  \ of mental illness. We address the questions of how mentally ill people were treated\
  \ in premodern times, if people thought they could be cured, and if they were always\
  \ stigmatized. Then, we talk about the advent of psychiatry, how people viewed suicide\
  \ historically, Foucault and the exercise of power over the mentally ill, and the\
  \ history of talk therapy. Finally, we ask if psychiatry is a science, and we discuss\
  \ the history of institutionalization and the deinstitutionalization movement in\
  \ psychiatry.\n\nTime Links:  \n01:07  How to properly think about mental illness\
