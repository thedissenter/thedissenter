shownotes: "Dr. Moshe Hoffman is a Research Scientist at the Max Planck Institute\
  \ for Evolutionary Biology and Lecturer at Harvard's Department of Economics. He\
  \ applies game theory, models of learning and evolution, and experimental methods,\
  \ to try to decipher the (often subconscious and subtle) incentives that shape our\
  \ social behavior, preferences, and ideologies.   \nDr. Erez Yoeli is a Research\
  \ Scientist at MIT\u2019s Sloan School of Management, where he directs the Applied\
  \ Cooperation Team (ACT). His research focuses on altruism: understanding how it\
  \ works and how to promote it.   \nThey are both authors of Hidden Games: The Surprising\
  \ Power of Game Theory to Explain Irrational Human Behavior.\n\nThis is the second\
  \ part of our talk about Hidden Games. You can watch the first part here: https://youtu.be/EGEdt6iuSQo.\
  \  \nThis time, we cover topics like strategic ignorance; learning, from the perspective\
  \ of game theory; the hawk-dove game; where rights come from; why apologies work;\
  \ why people buy luxury items; why people sometimes hide positive traits of achievements;\
  \ evidence games; repeated prisoner\u2019s dilemma, and human cooperation; how to\
  \ promote cooperation and altruism; continuous vs. categorical norms, and how they\
  \ arise; and how and why people develop passions.\n\n\n\nTime Links:  \n00:00 Intro\
