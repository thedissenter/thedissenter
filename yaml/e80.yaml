  \ guest on the show. Please go check out our first conversation, \u201CPostmodernism:\
  \ From Rousseau to the Present\u201D: https://youtu.be/rBTPMBKCZLs\n\nIn this episode,\
  \ we focus on Nietzsche\u2019s philosophy, and some of Dr. Hicks\u2019 views about\
  \ it, as exposed in his book, \u201CNietzsche and the Nazis\u201D. As the title\
  \ of the book implies, we talk about how Nietzsche might have influenced the German\
  \ National-Socialist political ideology, and, toward the end, we also get a little\
  \ bit into the connections between Nazism and Postmodernism, and how Nietzsche was\
  \ one of the major influences in both these political opposite ideologies. Specific\
  \ topics include Nietzsche\u2019s reactionary views against the values of the Enlightenment,\
  \ namely rationality and objectivity, individualism, progress, and science as whole.\n\
  \nTime Links:  \n00:59  Nietzsche\u2019s take on Rationality and Objectivity   \

  \ human rights?  \n26:14  About science and values  \n31:27  Did Nietzsche influence\
  \ Nazism? Was he anti-Semitic?          \n35:08  Did his sister, Elisabeth, really\
  \ distorted his views in The Will to Power?       \n44:33  In what specific ways\
  \ did Nietzsche influence Nazism?    \n51:23  The interesting ideological parallels\
