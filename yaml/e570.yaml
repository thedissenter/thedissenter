excerpt: Dr. Brian Knutson is a Professor of Psychology and Neuroscience at Stanford
  University. His research focuses on the neural basis of emotional experience and
  expression. His long-term goal is to understand the neurochemical and neuroanatomical
  mechanisms responsible for emotional experience, and to explore the implications
  of these findings for the assessment and treatment of clinical disorders as well
  as for economic behavior. He is a fellow of the Academy for Behavioral Medicine
  Research and the Association for Psychological Science, and his research has been
  funded by the National Science Foundation, National Institutes of Health, and numerous

  \ Psychology and Neuroscience at Stanford University. His research focuses on the\
  \ neural basis of emotional experience and expression. His long-term goal is to\
  \ understand the neurochemical and neuroanatomical mechanisms responsible for emotional\
  \ experience, and to explore the implications of these findings for the assessment\
  \ and treatment of clinical disorders as well as for economic behavior. He is a\

  \nIn this episode, we talk about affective neuroscience. We start by discussing\
  \ what it is, and the kinds of questions it deals with. We talk about affect, emotions,\
  \ and what they correspond to in the brain. We discuss if is makes sense to distinguish\
  \ between emotions and feelings. We talk about the areas in the brain that play\
  \ a role in emotion processing. We discuss the role emotions play in decision-making.\
  \ We talk about how affect influences preferences and beliefs. We ask if emotions\
  \ vary cross-culturally. We then get into aspects related to financial decisions,\
  \ including the relationship between future self-continuity and savings, financial\
  \ risk-taking, and gain and loss learning. We discuss if there are individual differences\
  \ in these domains, and if economic decisions vary across the lifespan. Finally,\
  \ we talk about what neuroscience adds to the picture of psychology and economics.\n\
