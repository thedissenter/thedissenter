  of prosociality, cooperation and conflict resolution and to identify the origins
  of economic institutions such as property rights. He has also worked on finding
  ways to increase the supply of transplantable organs, measuring the spitefulness
  of individuals, understanding the sources of asset price bubbles, evaluating individual
  theory of mind, and capturing the discovery process underlying specialization and

  \ professor of economics at the Smith Institute for Political Economy and Philosophy\
  \ in the Argyros School of Business and Economics at Chapman University. His research\
  \ uses experiments to explore the underpinnings of prosociality, cooperation and\
  \ conflict resolution and to identify the origins of economic institutions such\

  \ the sources of asset price bubbles, evaluating individual theory of mind, and\
  \ capturing the discovery process underlying specialization and trade, among other\
  \ topics.\n\nIn this episode, we talk about behavioral economics. We start with\
  \ norms, their origins, and why do people follow them. We also talk about institutions,\
  \ personal and impersonal exchange, specialization, and theory of mind. Toward the\
  \ end, we talk about organ donations, and adolescent smoking.\n\nTime Links:  \n\
