  \ science at the Institut Jean Nicod of the \xC9cole Normale Sup\xE9rieure in Paris.\
  \ Fascinated by apparently irrational beliefs and behaviors, he works with Hugo\
  \ Mercier on the role of epistemic reputation in communication and the cognitive\
  \ mechanisms underlying information transmission and evaluation.\n\nIn this episode,\
  \ we talk about fake news, and scientific misinformation. We start with fake news,\
  \ and discuss how widespread it really is, and the sort of cultural and social factors\
  \ behind fake news sharing. We talk about misinformation on misinformation, and\
  \ moral panics about fake news. We also talk about scientific misinformation during\
  \ the COVID pandemic, and how governments and health authorities could have done\
  \ a better job of communicating COVID-related information. We finish with a discussion\
  \ of what would make for more effective science communication.\n\nTime Links:  \n\
