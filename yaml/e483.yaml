excerpt: Dr. Lauren Brent is Associate Professor in the Centre for Research in Animal
  Behaviour at the University of Exeter. She is a biologist interested in the evolution
  of sociality. Her research asks why social relationships are formed and how they
  are maintained. Her work focuses on highly gregarious, group-living animals. She
  works mostly with data collected from wild or free-ranging groups, and specialize
  on study systems with uniquely long-term datasets. She uses a diverse set of methods,
  including techniques from ethology, evolutionary biology, quantitative and functional
  genetics, life-history evolution, endocrinology, comparative psychology, and cognitive
  neuroscience.

  \ in the Centre for Research in Animal Behaviour at the University of Exeter. She\
  \ is a biologist interested in the evolution of sociality. Her research asks why\
  \ social relationships are formed and how they are maintained. Her work focuses\

  \nIn this episode, we talk about the evolution of sociality. We first ask what sociality\
  \ is. We then go through topics like: individual variation in how animals establish\
  \ social relations; what social complexity is; the importance and benefits of social\
  \ connections; how kin selection and reciprocal altruism influence social organization;\
  \ indirect connections; friendships; how prolonged life after reproduction evolved;\
  \ a case study from 2012 about how rhesus macaques reacted to a group member that\
  \ died of a fatal attack; and neuroethology.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:00 Intro  \n00:44\
