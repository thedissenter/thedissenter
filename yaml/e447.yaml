  \ do about it\u201D.\n\nIn this episode, we focus on The New Science of Narcissism.\
  \ First we define narcissism. We talk about its heritability, and the relationship\
  \ with the Big Five personality traits, and with the Dark Triad. We discuss the\
  \ benefits and costs of narcissism, for the narcissist and for the people around\
  \ him. We refer to Trump, and ask if mental health professionals should diagnose\
  \ political figures. We talk about social media and its relationship with narcissism.\
  \ We ask if it is possible to reduce levels of narcissism in individuals, and also\
  \ who should seek therapy. Toward the end, we talk about the cultural aspects of\
  \ mental disorders, and the questions about narcissism we have yet to answer.\n\n\
