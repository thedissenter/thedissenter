shownotes: "RECORDED ON MAY 4th 2020.  \nDr. Peter Jonason is Associate Professor\
  \ of Psychology at the University of Padova, Italy. By training he is a social/personality\
  \ psychologist who uses evolutionary theory to derive predictions and account for\
  \ observable phenomena in (mostly) personality, individual differences, mating strategies,\
  \ and sexuality.\n\nIn this episode, we focus on human mating behavior. We first\
  \ talk about the relationship between the Dark Triad traits and mating behavior,\
  \ and also the costs associated with them. Then we go through some specific topics,\
  \ like the willingness to get caught in an extra-pair relationship, the mate preferences\
  \ of educated people, and what we can learn about human mating by studying the booty\
  \ call. Finally, we talk about some of the psychological barriers to accepting findings\
  \ in evolutionary psychology.\n\nTime Links:  \n01:04  Personality (the Dark Triad),\
  \ and mating behavior  \n06:20  Is there a connection between the Dark Triad traits\
  \ and life history strategies?  \n13:10  Psychological, social, and physical health\
  \ costs associated with the Dark Triad  \n18:47  Willingness to get caught in an\
  \ extra-pair relationship  \n25:45  Mate preferences for educated partners  \n39:32\
  \  The booty call, and what it tells us about human mating  \n48:36  Beliefs that\
  \ get in the way of accepting findings in evolutionary psychology  \n1:05:22  Follow\
