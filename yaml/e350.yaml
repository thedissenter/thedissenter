shownotes: "RECORDED ON JUNE 6th 2020.  \nJulian De Freitas is a cognitive scientist\
  \ in the Department of Psychology at Harvard University. He studies social intelligence,\
  \ with a focus on the self, strategic thinking, and ethics.\n\nIn this episode,\
  \ we talk about the self, morality, and common knowledge. We start by tackling the\
  \ questions of what is really the \u201Cself\u201D, and the relationship between\
  \ the self and moral behavior. Then we talk about moral judgment, the optimality\
  \ bias, common intuitions about the moral nature of the self, and morality, happiness,\
  \ and the meaning of life. We also discuss common knowledge from a cognitive scientific\
  \ and game theoretical perspectives. We refer to the relationship among common knowledge,\
  \ collective coordination, and strategic thinking; how common knowledge explains\
  \ the bystander effect better than the traditional explanation; and common knowledge\
  \ and charitable behavior. Finally, we discuss if beliefs really cause behavior.\n\
