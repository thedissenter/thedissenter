  s also interested in the methodological and theoretical issues that pertain to the\
  \ measurement of cognitive reflection and motivated reasoning.\n\nIn this episode,\
  \ we first talk about dual-process theory, reasoning and rationality, motivated\
  \ reasoning, the Dunning-Kruger effect, and the analytic cognitive style and ability.\
  \ We then go through what characterizes pseudo-profound bullshit in terms of discourse,\
  \ the language of climate change deniers, and fake news and misinformation (particularly\
  \ on the internet).\n\nTime Links:  \n01:28  Differences between intuitive processes\
  \ and deliberative reasoning processes  \n08:05  Does analytic thinking lead to\
  \ better judgments?  \n12:32  Reasoning and rationality  \n17:16  Do smart people\
  \ have better intuitions?  \n20:01  About motivated reasoning  \n24:42  The Dunning-Kruger\
  \ effect  \n28:34  What are cognitive styles (focusing on the analytic cognitive\
  \ style/ability)?  \n35:06  Pseudo-profound discourse  \n39:02  The language used\
  \ by climate change deniers  \n42:33  What is \u201Cfake news\u201D?  \n45:13  Do\
  \ fake news really have a big impact on people\u2019s lives?  \n49:00  What characterizes\
  \ false information that is successfully transmitted among people?  \n51:01  Are\
  \ there people more susceptible to it than others?  \n56:02  Do repeated statements\
  \ have any important effect on people?  \n58:58  What are the best proven methods\
  \ to fight against fake news and its spread?  \n1:03:51  Follow Dr. Pennycook\u2019\
