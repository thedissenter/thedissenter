excerpt: "Dr. Helena Miton is Complexity Postdoctoral Fellow at the Santa Fe Institute.\
  \ Dr. Miton\u2019s research agenda approaches culture as an emergent effect of human\
  \ everyday life. It aims to understand how individuals interact to produce, organize\
  \ and transmit cultural systems. Aiming to redefine how we study culture, her research\
  \ program includes both theoretical advances and empirical case studies. She studies\
  \ cultural evolution using data from human and social sciences, with a strong emphasis\
  \ on cognitive science. She plans on investigating how characteristics of small-scale\
  \ interactions can impact cultural productions at larger scales, in the context\
  \ of both technical knowledge and economic practices."

  \ Fellow at the Santa Fe Institute. Dr. Miton\u2019s research agenda approaches\
  \ culture as an emergent effect of human everyday life. It aims to understand how\
  \ individuals interact to produce, organize and transmit cultural systems. Aiming\
  \ to redefine how we study culture, her research program includes both theoretical\
  \ advances and empirical case studies. She studies cultural evolution using data\
  \ from human and social sciences, with a strong emphasis on cognitive science. She\
  \ plans on investigating how characteristics of small-scale interactions can impact\
  \ cultural productions at larger scales, in the context of both technical knowledge\
  \ and economic practices.\n\nIn this episode, we talk about how we can study culture\
  \ through cognitive science. We discuss lab studies and their limitations. We talk\
  \ about mechanisms of cultural transmission, and cultural stability. We discuss\
  \ if cumulative culture needs high-fidelity copying. We go through cultural phenomena\
  \ like maladaptive medical practices, and the evolution of complexity in graphic\
  \ communication systems, like heraldry and writing. We discuss how we go from small-scale\
  \ interactions to large-scale cultural productions. Finally, we talk about the cultural\
  \ transmission of tacit knowledge.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:00 Intro  \n00:33  Cognitive\
