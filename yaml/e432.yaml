  \ Professor of Psychology at the University of Colorado Colorado Springs (UCCS).\
  \ Before, he was an Assistant Professor at Bilkent University in Turkey and a Visiting\
  \ Fellow at the Institute for Advanced Study in Berlin, Germany. Laith has taught\
  \ and conducted research in several different countries, and is a member of the\
  \ Arab-German Young Academy (AGYA), as well as an academic adviser at Ideas Beyond\
  \ Borders (IBB).\n\nIn this episode, we focus on a recent article of his published\
  \ on Areo Magazine - Evolutionary Psychology: Predictively Powerful or Riddled with\
  \ Just-So Stories?. We first tackle the misconception of evolutionary psychology\u2019\
  s predictions, hypotheses and theories being nothing but just-so stories. We mention\
  \ hypotheses that have been falsified in evolutionary psychology. We discuss the\
  \ emotions of anger and disgust, and address the controversy surrounding the domains\
  \ of disgust. We talk about error management theory. In the final part, we discuss\
  \ cultural psychology, the influence of culture on human psychology, and how evolutionary\
  \ psychology deals with culture. We also address the WEIRD problem in Psychology,\
  \ and more particularly in evolutionary psychology.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:00 Intro\
