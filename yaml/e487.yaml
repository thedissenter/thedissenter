  \ Professor of Psychology and Associate Director for Communications at Vanderbilt\
  \ Brain Institute at Vanderbilt University. She is interested in comparative neuroanatomy,\
  \ cellular composition of brains, brain morphology, brain evolution, metabolic cost\
  \ of body and brain, sleep requirement across species, feeding time, and really\
  \ interested in how all of these are tied together. She writes about neuroscience\
  \ and science in general for the public. She is the author of The Human Advantage:\
  \ A New Understanding of How Our Brain Became Remarkable (MIT Press, 2016).\n\n\
  In this episode, we focus on The Human Advantage, and also on a chapter of the edited\
  \ book, A Most Interesting Problem: What Darwin\u2019s Descent of Man Got Right\
  \ and Wrong about Human Evolution. We debunk many myths about the human brain, focusing\
  \ on things like its size, its number of cells, its organization, its metabolic\
  \ cost, its functions, and how we compare to other species. We also make reference\
  \ to some of the ideas Darwin exposed on The Descent of Man, and what he got right\
  \ and wrong.  \nThis interview is part of a short series I am doing on the 150th\
  \ anniversary of Darwin\u2019s Descent of Man.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:00 Intro  \n\
  01:13  How the brain evolved  \n07:47  Are we a typical primate?  \n12:40  Do we\
  \ have an unusual number of neurons?  \n21:53  Diet and the human brain  \n30:09\
  \  Do we really have 100 billion neurons?  \n34:07  Is there any correlation between\
  \ brain and cognitive capabilities?  \n37:19  Are brain cells the same across species?\
  \  \n44:55  The brains of our hominin ancestors  \n50:42  Are we special in any\
  \ way?  \n54:55  What did Darwin get right and wrong?  \n1:02:19  Follow Dr. Herculano-Houzel\u2019\
