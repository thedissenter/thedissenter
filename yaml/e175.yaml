  \ Oakland University, studying under the advisement of Todd K. Shackelford. She\

  \ theory and sperm competition theory.\n\nIn this episode, our discussion is focused\
  \ on human mating, life history theory, attachment theory and attachment styles,\
  \ and also mate guarding and mate retention strategies. We first refer to the many\
  \ dimensions of human mating, and the innate and environmental aspects of it. Then,\
  \ we talk about the types of attachment that we have, and how they related to how\
  \ we establish romantic relationships. We also refer to the specific case of coalitional\
  \ mate retention strategies. Finally, we discuss the role of marriage and children\
  \ in romantic relationships, and pair-bonding, parental investment and cooperative\
  \ breeding in humans. \n\nTime Links:  \n01:03  The many dimensions of human mating,\
