  \ economic assets, and how that influences division of labor between the sexes,\
  \ and child labor. We finish by talking a little bit about how people\u2019s perceptions\
  \ about children changed over time in the West, and some of the reason behind that\
  \ change.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:45  Do children share traits across different cultures?\
