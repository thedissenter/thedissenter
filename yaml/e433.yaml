  \ Change and Earth System Science at the University of Exeter and Director of the\
  \ Global Systems Institute. He has over 20 years of research experience in studying\
  \ the Earth as a system, and developing and using models to understand its behavior.\
  \ He is particularly interested in how life has reshaped the planet in the past,\
  \ and what lessons we can draw from this as we proceed to reshape the planet now.\
  \ These topics are covered in his books \u2018Earth System Science: A Very Short\
  \ Introduction\u2019 (OUP, 2016) and (with Andrew Watson) \u2019Revolutions that\
  \ Made the Earth\u2019 (OUP, 2011).\n\nIn this episode, we talk about Revolutions\
  \ that Made the Earth. We go through topics like: the intimate relationship between\
  \ geology and life; the origins of life (in hydrothermal vents); what Dr. Lenton,\
  \ in the book, calls the \u201Ccritical steps\u201D model of life; multicellular\
  \ and complex life; the evolution of social life; culture; what is special about\
  \ humans; the development of agriculture, and its impact on the planet; the Anthropocene,\
  \ and when it started; new revolutions in the future; and if life on Earth was inevitable.\n\
