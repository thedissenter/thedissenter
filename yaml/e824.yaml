shownotes: "RECORDED ON JUNE 12th 2023.  \nDr. Valerie Fridland is Professor and former\
  \ Director of Graduate Studies in the Department of English at the University of\
  \ Nevada in Reno. She is an expert on the relationship between language and society.\
  \ Dr. Fridland also speaks and writes widely for a popular audience. Her language\
  \ blog, Language in the Wild, appears in Psychology Today and her lecture series,\
  \ Language and Society, is featured with The Great Courses.  She is the author of\
  \ several books, including Like, Literally, Dude: Arguing for the Good in Bad English.\
  \ \n\nIn this episode, we focus on \u201CLike, Literally, Dude\u201D. We start by\
  \ talking about what people call \u201Cbad\u201D English, the history of standardization\
  \ and prescription in English, and how grammar rules are mostly arbitrary. We discuss\
  \ who drives linguistics change, and the role of women and low-status people. We\
  \ talk about what gender has to do with how we speak. We then talk about the uses\
  \ of filled pauses like \u201Cum\u201D and \u201Cuh\u201D, and the uses of \u201C\
  like\u201D, \u201CI mean\u201D, \u201Cyou know\u201D, and \u201Cso\u201D. We also\
  \ talk about the meaning of \u201Cdude\u201D, and \u201Cliterally\u201D, and we\
  \ discuss if words have any intrinsic meaning. Finally, we discuss the current proposal\
  \ of using \u201Cthey/them\u201D as singular personal pronouns to refer to non-binary\
  \ people, and removing/banning words from classic books.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:00\
