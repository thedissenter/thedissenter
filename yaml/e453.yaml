shownotes: "RECORDED ON JANUARY 25th 2021.  \nDr. Giuliana Spadaro is Visiting Fellow\
  \ in the Faculty of Behavioral and Movement Sciences at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam.\
  \ She is interested in conducting experimental research on prosocial and cooperative\
  \ behavior. Her PhD project captured this interest, and focused on understanding\
  \ the relation between institutions, trust, and cooperation among strangers.\n\n\
  In this episode, we talk about trust and cooperation. We define trust, and talk\
  \ about trust and cooperation among strangers. We discuss individual differences\
  \ in trust, and trust on an individual and societal level. We explore why different\
  \ countries have different levels of interpersonal trust, differences in trust between\
  \ individualistic and collectivistic societies, and the economic and social outcomes\
  \ associated with it. We discuss if different groups of migrants show different\
  \ levels of trust toward native people, and if they adapt to the society they migrate\
  \ to across generations. We talk about the personality traits associated with prosocial\
  \ behavior. We refer to the bystander effect, and the explanations behind it. Finally,\
  \ we ask if it is possible to increase levels of interpersonal trust.\n\nTime Links:\
