  \ Department of Anthropology, and the Director of the Center for Behavior, Evolution\
  \ and Culture at UCLA. He is a biological anthropologist specializing in evolutionary\
  \ psychology, the study of the mind\u2019s evolved mechanisms and processes. In\
  \ his work he uses methods from anthropology and psychology to examine universals\
  \ and variation in how thinking develops across cultures. He conducts field research\
  \ among the Shuar, an indigenous culture in southeast Ecuador, as well as in Los\
  \ Angeles. His research has focused on learning and conceptual development in several\
  \ domains, including \u201Ctheory of mind,\u201D or the ability to make inferences\
  \ about others\u2019 thoughts and intentions, and learning about danger. He has\
  \ also collaborated with a variety of anthropologists, psychologists, and other\
  \ social scientists on a variety of topics ranging from infant-directed speech to\
  \ the evolution of morality, and supervise graduate projects on the evolution of\
  \ cognition. He\u2019s the author of the book The Shape of Thought: How Mental Adaptations\
  \ Evolve.\n\nIn this episode, we talk about consciousness, theory of mind, moral\
  \ judgment, and cross-cultural studies of the human mind. We start with consciousness,\
  \ and we discuss the role that it plays and what functions it might serve from an\
  \ evolutionary perspective. Then, we talk about theory of mind, and we question\
  \ if a mentalistic basis of morality, and more specifically moral judgment, is found\
  \ across all societies, or is culturally variable. In the second part of the talk,\
  \ we mention the WEIRD problem, and how to improve the science of the human mind,\
  \ develop a true cognitive science of the human mind, and improve psychological\
  \ studies.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:51  Consciousness: its evolution and function  \n\
