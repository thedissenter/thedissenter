  \ of Psychology at the University of Minnesota. In his research in personality psychology,\
  \ he has examined the theoretical structure of personality and the biological basis\
  \ of personality.\n\nIn this episode, we talk about the Big Five personality traits\
  \ and their ten aspects. We first go through the ten aspects. We then talk about\
  \ the personality traits of liberals and conservatives, and gender differences in\
  \ personality. We discuss the behavioral genetics of personality, the neuroscience\
  \ of it, and the changes in personality that occur across the lifespan. In the latter\
  \ part of the conversation, Dr. DeYoung explains his Cybernetic Big Five Theory\
  \ (CB5T), and a cybernetic theory of psychopathology. We also refer to the difficulties\
  \ in the classification of mental disorders.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:47  All about\
