shownotes: "RECORDED ON JULY 15th 2022.  \nDr. Victor Kumar is Assistant Professor\
  \ of Philosophy at Boston University. He is director of the Mind and Morality Lab.\
  \ He is also a member of the interdisciplinary Moral Psychology Research Group.\
  \ His primary philosophical interests are in ethics, cognitive science, and evolutionary\
  \ theory. He also has interests in epistemology, philosophy of mind, feminist philosophy,\
  \ and philosophy of race. He is the author (with Richmond Campbell) of A Better\
  \ Ape: The Evolution of the Moral Mind and How it Made us Human.\n\nIn this episode,\
  \ we focus on A Better Ape. We first present the gene-culture coevolution framework\
  \ used in the book. We talk about the evolution of human altruism. We get into the\
  \ three ingredients of the moral mind: core moral emotions (sympathy, loyalty, trust,\
  \ respect, guilt, shame, resentment, and indignation); core moral norms (harm, kinship,\
  \ reciprocity, autonomy, and fairness); and a capacity for open-ended moral reasoning.\
  \ We discuss moral intuition, and why moral reasoning is not all about post-hoc\
  \ rationalization. We talk about moral progress, and the role of ideas. We talk\
  \ about institutional moralities. We discuss the role of religion, and moral philosophy.\
  \ We ask if it is possible to a universal ethical code. Finally, we talk about political\
  \ correctness, and a theoretical framework to addressing injustice and inequality.\n\
