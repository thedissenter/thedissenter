excerpt: 'Dr. Jonathon Crystal is Professor of Psychological and Brain Sciences at
  Indiana University. His research focuses on developing animal models of cognition.
  His current work focuses on episodic memory, source memory, and prospective memory
  in rats. He has also developed rodent models to assess retrieval practice, working
  memory, and metacognition. He is currently the Editor of Learning & Behavior, and
  he recently served as President of the Comparative Cognition Society. '

  In this episode, we talk about studying memory in nonhuman animals, primarily in\
  \ rats. First, we talk about ways of classifying different types of memory. We then\
  \ get into how Dr. Crystal designs experiments to study different types of memory\
  \ and know if they even exist in other animals, including episodic memory and prospective\
  \ memory. Toward the end, we also refer to metacognition.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:52\
