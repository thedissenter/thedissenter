  \ You can watch the first one here: https://youtu.be/engIPGdURnY\n\nIn this episode,\
  \ we focus on Visions of Inequality. We start by talking about how long people have\
  \ been thinking about economic inequality, and the elements of the best income distribution\
  \ studies. We then go through the work of authors like Fran\xE7ois Quesnay, Adam\
  \ Smith, David Ricardo, Karl Marx, Vilfredo Pareto, and Simon Kuznets, and how there\
  \ was a natural progression across them. We discuss how and why studies of income\
  \ distribution went into retreat during the Cold War era; the rise of neoliberalism\
  \ and its consequences; and what led to the revival of economic studies. We also\
  \ talk about a recent expansion in our understanding of the dynamics of inequality,\
  \ with race and gender inequality. Finally, we discuss Dr. Milanovi\u0107\u2019\
  s goals with this book.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:00  Intro  \n00:41  How long have people\
