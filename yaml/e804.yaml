excerpt: Dr. Deborah Gordon is a Professor in the Department of Biology at Stanford
  University. She studies how ant colonies work without central control using networks
  of simple interactions, and how these networks evolve in relation to changing environments.
  Her projects include a long-term study of a population of harvester ant colonies
  in Arizona, studies of the invasive Argentine ant in northern California, arboreal
  ant trail networks and ant-plant mutualisms in Central America.

shownotes: "RECORDED ON MARCH 9th 2023.  \nDr. Deborah Gordon is a Professor in the\
  \ Department of Biology at Stanford University. She studies how ant colonies work\
  \ without central control using networks of simple interactions, and how these networks\
  \ evolve in relation to changing environments. Her projects include a long-term\
  \ study of a population of harvester ant colonies in Arizona, studies of the invasive\
  \ Argentine ant in northern California, arboreal ant trail networks and ant-plant\
  \ mutualisms in Central America.\n\nIn this episode, we talk about ant colonies.\
  \ We discuss decision-making from an ecological perspective, and distributed problem\
  \ solving. We talk about the tole of genetics and the environment in ant sociality.\
  \ We discuss task allocation, and why \u201Cdivision of labor\u201D is not a good\
  \ term to apply here. We talk about how ants recognize nestmates. We discuss genetic\
  \ relatedness, kin selection, group selection, and the debate surrounding levels\
  \ of selection in evolutionary biology. We talk about ant personality. We discuss\
  \ if there are hierarchies or caste systems in ant colonies. Finally, we discuss\
  \ if the study of ants can help us understand other systems that work without central\
  \ control, and if we can extrapolate from ants to humans.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:00\
