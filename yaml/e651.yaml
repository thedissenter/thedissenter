  \ Philosophy at Brown University. Dr. Reginster's research has focused mostly on\

  \ we talk about The Affirmation of Life. We start by asking if Nietzsche\u2019s\
  \ philosophy was systematic at all. We get into nihilism, its relationship with\
  \ pessimism, where our values stem from, how we can revaluate them, and life-negating\
  \ and life-affirming values. We talk about happiness, suffering, meaningfulness,\
  \ and master and slave morality.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:00 Intro  \n00:55  Was Nietzsche\u2019\
