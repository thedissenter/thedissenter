  \ Speech, Fake News, Post-Truth, and Donald Trump (2019).\n\nIn this episode, we\
  \ focus on free speech. Dr. Fish presents his thesis against the idea that free\
  \ speech exists, and we discuss its details. We start with a bit of Dr. Fish\u2019\
  s background and where his interest in free speech comes from, and also a definition\
  \ of free speech. We talk about John Stuart Mill\u2019s position, and the history\
  \ of the political struggle for free speech. We discuss freedom of speech in the\
  \ context of academia and the media. We ask if it makes sense to distinguish speech\
  \ from action, and also address the distinction between freedom of speech and freedom\
  \ of inquiry. Toward the end, Dr. Fish explains why he thinks \u201Cphilosophy does\
  \ not matter\u201D.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:00 Intro  \n00:45  Dr. Fish\u2019s background,\
