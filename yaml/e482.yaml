excerpt: David Pearce is a prominent figure within the transhumanism movement and
  one of the co-founders of the World Transhumanist Association, currently rebranded
  and incorporated as Humanity+. He approaches ethical issues from a lexical negative
  utilitarian perspective. Pearce maintains a series of websites devoted to transhumanist
  topics and what he calls the "hedonistic imperative", a moral obligation to work
  towards the abolition of suffering in all sentient life. His self-published internet
  manifesto, The Hedonistic Imperative (1995), outlines how pharmacology, genetic
  engineering, nanotechnology and neurosurgery could converge to eliminate all forms
  of unpleasant experience from human and non-human life, replacing suffering with
  "gradients of bliss". Pearce calls this the "abolitionist project".

  \nIn this episode, we talk about transhumanism, the hedonistic imperative, and the\
  \ abolitionist project. We first get into concepts like negative utilitarianism,\
  \ hedonism, and gradients of bliss. We discuss the goals of the abolitionist project,\
  \ and the living beings it would target. We talk about the different technological\
  \ approaches to abolishing suffering, like pharmacology, genetic engineering, nanotechnology,\
  \ neurosurgery, becoming cyborgs, Nozick\u2019s experience machine, and immortality.\
  \ We discuss to what extent these technologies are sufficiently well-developed,\
  \ or if we would need to wait more time. We discuss why social, economic, and political\
  \ reforms are not enough. We tackle questions regarding how our human experience\
  \ would change. We discuss how we should deal with people who would prefer to opt\
  \ out of the abolitionist project. Finally, we ask if we have less suffering in\
  \ the world nowadays. \n\nTime Links:  \n00:00  Intro  \n00:52  Utilitarianism,\
