  \ Alexander University, Erlangen, and in the Department of English Language and\
  \ Linguistics at Birmingham University. Her research interests include cognitive\
  \ linguistics, language acquisition, the mental status of rules, and individual\
  \ differences in linguistic knowledge. She has published monographs on the semantics\
  \ of case and the relationship between linguistics and other disciplines studying\
  \ language, and numerous articles. She is the editor of Cognitive Linguistics and\
  \ Vice President of the UK Cognitive Linguistics Association.\n\nIn this episode,\
  \ we talk about linguistics. We start by covering some of the most prominent theories\
  \ of language, including nativism, constructivism, and functional theories. We then\
  \ discuss several aspects of native language attainment, and also how people acquire\
  \ second languages. We discuss specifically the role of education and inputs. Finally,\
  \ we discuss the \u201Cpoverty of the stimulus\u201D argument for nativism.\n\n\
