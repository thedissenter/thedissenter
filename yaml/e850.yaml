  \ History at Boston University. Dr. McCann\u2019s research and teaching interests\
  \ include agricultural and ecological history of Africa, Ethiopia, and the Horn\
  \ of Africa, field research methods in African studies, the agro-ecology of tropical\

  \ Maize and Grace. We talk about maize and its main traits as a crop. We discuss\
  \ how it spread across the globe, and particularly, how it got to Africa. We talk\
  \ about the role of politics and economics in the spread of maize across Africa,\
  \ and we get into the illustrative example of southern Africa, and how how politics,\
  \ science, and race intermingled there. We discuss the impact of maize on Africa\u2019\
  s biodiversity and the health and nutrition of African people. We talk about how\
  \ colonialism influenced the spread of crops across the globe. We discuss the causal\
  \ relationship between climate and history. Finally, we discuss the work of Jared\
  \ Diamond, and the idea of geographical determinism.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:00 Intro\
