  program at the Department of Psychology at the University of Nevada. An author of
  44 books and nearly 600 scientific articles, his career has focused on an analysis
  of the nature of human language and cognition and the application of this to the
  understanding and alleviation of human suffering. He is the developer of Relational
  Frame Theory, an account of human higher cognition, and has guided its extension
  to Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), a popular evidence-based form of psychotherapy
  that uses mindfulness, acceptance, and values-based methods. His most recent books
