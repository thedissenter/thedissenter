  \ the approach developed by Dr. Cecilia Heyes and collaborators, as exposed in her\
  \ book, Cognitive Gadgets \u2013 cultural evolutionary psychology. First, we discuss\
  \ what it borrows from Evolutionary Psychology and Cultural Evolutionary Theory,\
  \ and what assumptions from both of those fields it rejects. We talk about modularity\
  \ of mind, and then get into two of the cognitive mechanisms that Dr. Heyes explores\
  \ in the book, namely imitation and mindreading (or theory of mind). We get a bit\
  \ into how language might influence our thinking. And toward the end we address\
  \ issues regarding human nature, and evolutionary mismatch.\n\nTime Links:  \n01:12\
