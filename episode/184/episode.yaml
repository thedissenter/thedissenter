shownotes: "Dr. Hector A. Garcia is a clinical psychologist specializing in the treatment\
  \ of combat-related post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). He\u2019s Assistant Professor\
  \ at the Department of Psychiatry at the University of Texas Health Science Center\
  \ at San Antonio. He has published extensively on the treatment of PTSD in combat\

  \ He\u2019s also the author of Alpha God: The Psychology of Religious Violence and\
  \ Oppression, and Sex, Power, and Partisanship: How Evolutionary Science Makes Sense\
  \ of Our Political Divide.\n\nIn this episode, we focus our conversation on Dr.\
  \ Garcia\u2019s latest book, \u201CSex, Power, and Partisanship\u201D. We talk about\
  \ how the liberal and conservative political tribes evolved from the standard masculine\
  \ and feminine psychologies. We discuss how traits that might have served an evolutionary\
  \ function in the past are not necessarily good for us in our modern environments,\
  \ the phenomenon of instinct blindness, and the naturalistic fallacy. We refer to\
  \ the fact that most human societies have been patriarchal and how the systems of\
  \ rule and law favored men, and allowed for them to control women\u2019s behavior,\
  \ with focus on their sexual behavior. Finally, we talk about our current polarized\
  \ political environment, and how we can apply this knowledge to counter it, and\
  \ also what could be the best ways to deal with gender equality in politics.\n\n\
