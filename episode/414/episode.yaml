shownotes: "RECORDED ON OCTOBER 30th 2020.  \nDr. Robert McCauley is the William Rand\
  \ Kenan Jr. University Professor of Philosophy at the Center for Mind, Brain, and\
  \ Culture, at Emory University.   \nDr. George Graham is former Professor of Philosophy\
  \ at the University of Alabama at Birmingham and Georgia State University, and the\
  \ AC Reid Professor of Philosophy at Wake Forest University.  \nThey are both authors\
  \ of a recent book, Hearing Voices and Other Matters of the Mind: What Mental Abnormalities\
  \ Can Teach Us About Religions.  \nIn this episode, we focus on their book. We start\
  \ by covering some of the concepts that they explore in the book, like ecumenical\
  \ naturalism and purpose-driven continuity theory. We talk about the continuity\
  \ between religious cognition, normal cognition and mental disorders, and what happens\
  \ when mental disorders manifest in a religious context. We also discuss mental\
  \ disorders more generally, and ask if they are illnesses, and if they are cultural.\
  \ We tackle the issue of by-product, adaptation, and cultural group selection approaches\
  \ to religion. We then go through the mental disorders covered in the book. We start\
  \ with a condition that is also experienced by normal people: hallucinatory voices.\
  \ We then talk about depression, Obsessive-compulsive disorder, and autism. Finally,\
  \ we discuss if we really need to study people\u2019s beliefs to understand religious\
  \ phenomena, and end with how the framework laid out in the book can be applied\
  \ to studying terrorism, and in a clinical context.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>01:04</time>\
