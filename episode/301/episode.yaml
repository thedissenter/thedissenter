  \ Anthropology at Montana Tech. His research centers on investigating human ocular,\
  \ orbital, midfacial, cerebral and neurocranial morphology, and how competition\
  \ among these features may act to constrain the eye and surrounding ocular tissues\
  \ during ontogeny, as it relates to the disparate incidence & severity of astigmatism\
  \ and juvenile-onset myopia. Further research interests center on investigating\
  \ hominin biocultural evolution, astrobiology, astronomy and the physics of time\
  \ as they relate to the UFO phenomenon. On that pic, he has written a book, Identified\
  \ Flying Objects: A Multidisciplinary Scientific Approach to the UFO Phenomenon.\n\
  \nIn this episode, we focus on the thesis that Dr. Masters puts forward in his book,\
  \ where he tries to explain the UFO phenomenon as being humans from the future backward\
  \ time travelling. We go through the unreliability of the personal reports, and\
  \ why we have to be careful about that. Then we get into the biological anthropology\
  \ bit, and refer to trends in the evolution of the human body, mostly the head,\
  \ for the past 6 million years, and how it could continue into the future. We also\
  \ address the theoretical bases of time travel, and its many complications. Finally,\
  \ we discuss what people from the future could have to gain from travelling back\
  \ to the past.\n\n\n\nTime Links:  \n01:09  The UFO phenomenon  \n04:44  Time travel,\
