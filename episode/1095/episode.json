He is one of the most highly cited psychologists in the world.

We discuss what a mental disorder is, and the relationship between personality traits and psychopathology. We then talk about The Hierarchical Taxonomy of Psychopathology, the relationship between symptoms and traits, etiology and causal influences, and how disorders are classified within this framework. We also talk about a general factor of psychopathology, and personality disorders. Finally, we discuss subjective wellbeing, and how it relates to personality traits.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:38</time> Classification of psychiatric disorders  \n<time>04:08</time> What is a mental disorder?  \n<time>06:39</time> Personality traits and psychopathology  \n<time>09:41</time> The Hierarchical Taxonomy of Psychopathology  \n<time>19:25</time> Symptoms and traits  \n<time>22:19</time> Etiology and causal influences  \n<time>26:23</time> Classifying mental disorders  \n<time>31:42</time> A general factor of psychopathology  \n<time>36:58</time> Personality disorders  \n<time>40:52</time> Subjective wellbeing and personality  \n<time>48:17</time> Follow Dr. Krueger\u2019s work!\n\n---\n\nFollow Dr. Krueger\u2019s work:  \nFaculty page: https://tinyurl.com/262zxbn7  \nGoogle Scholar page: https://tinyurl.com/nk37a6s7\n",
