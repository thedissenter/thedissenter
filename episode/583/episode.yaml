  \ Science at UC Irvine School of Social Ecology. He is interested in \u201Chot cognition\u201D\
  \ \u2014 the interface between passion and reason. His research examines the role\
  \ of motivation, emotion and intuition in social, political, moral, medical, and\

  \ in a variety of psychological issues involved in end-of-life medical decision\
  \ making.\n\nIn this episode, we talk about motivated reasoning, morality, and politics.\
  \ We start with motivated reasoning, what it is, and the domains where it applies.\
  \ We apply it to medical decision-making. We discuss how moral reasoning works,\
  \ moral intuitions, moral foundations, and the connection between morality and politics.\
  \ We talk about political bias and science denial on the left and the right. We\
  \ discuss the special case of libertarians. Finally, we talk about how we should\
  \ think about the relation between personality and politics, and personality and\
  \ morality, and Dr. Ditto gives an evolutionary rationale for motivated reasoning\
  \ and political behavior.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:00 Intro  \n00:43  What is motivated\
