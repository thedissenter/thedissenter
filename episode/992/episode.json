	"shownotes": "Dr. Jerald Mosley is a former California Supervising Deputy Attorney General, and he has been researching, writing and speaking on law and sex work. He is the author of Sex Workers and Their Clients: In Their Own Words.\n\nIn this episode, we focus on Sex Workers and Their Clients. We start by discussing why it is important to consider the perspectives of sex workers and their clients, what a sex worker is, and the stigmatization of sex work. We then frame the debate between prohibitionists and some sex workers and sex-positive feminists, and explore claims surrounding the satisfaction and wellbeing of sex workers; whether sex work is a choice; sex trafficking; exploitation and empowerment; coercion and poverty; the prevalence of violence; objectification; and the claim that sex work is the product of patriarchy. We also talk about how sex workers describe their clients, and the role of sex-positive feminists who are not sex workers. We discuss common stereotypes about the clients, and the moralism of people who oppose sex work. Finally, we talk about approaches to sex work such as the \u201cEnd Demand\u201d approach, decriminalization, and how to prevent sex trafficking.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:31</time> Why it\u2019s important to talk about sex work  \n<time>03:15</time> What is a sex worker?  \n<time>05:58</time> The stigmatization of sex work  \n<time>09:19</time> Framing the debate  \n<time>12:41</time> The contrasting perspectives of sex-negative people and sex workers  \n<time>27:59</time> The satisfaction and wellbeing of sex workers  \n<time>39:58</time> Is sex work a choice?  \n<time>46:40</time> Sex trafficking and prohibitionism  \n<time>55:27</time> Exploitation or empowerment?  \n<time>1:02:01</time> Coercion and poverty  \n<time>1:12:33</time> Violence  \n<time>1:18:47</time> How sex workers describe their clients  \n<time>1:25:06</time> Objectification  \n<time>1:29:00</time> Patriarchy  \n<time>1:33:20</time> Sex-positive feminists  \n<time>1:36:54</time> Decriminalization, and preventing sex trafficking  \n<time>1:41:32</time> Stereotypes about the clients  \n<time>1:47:00</time> The moralism of people who oppose sex work  \n<time>1:51:15</time> Issues with the \u201cEnd Demand\u201d approach  \n<time>1:59:27</time> Follow Dr. Mosley\u2019s work!\n\n---\n\nFollow Dr. Mosley\u2019s work:  \nSex Workers and Their Clients: https://tinyurl.com/3cu2jcum\n",
