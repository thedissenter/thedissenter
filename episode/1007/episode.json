	"shownotes": "RECORDED ON MARCH 26th 2024.  \nDr. Brian Talbot is an Assistant Professor of Philosophy at the University of Colorado, Boulder. His work is on epistemology, ethics, and the intersection of ethics and epistemology. He is the author of The End of Epistemology As We Know It.\n\nIn this episode, we focus on The End of Epistemology As We Know It. We start by talking about epistemic norms, and the standard epistemic norms that most philosophers follow. We discuss why epistemic norms matter, and what happens when there is conflict between epistemic norms and moral norms. We talk about the difference between knowledge and true beliefs, and we also discuss pointless beliefs, mundane beliefs, and interesting beliefs. We then talk about nonstandard epistemic norms, and Dr. Talbot\u2019s methodology to get at replacement norms. Finally, we discuss whether epistemic norms are categorical.\n\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:24</time> The premise of the book  \n<time>05:45</time> Epistemic norms  \n<time>07:13</time> Why do epistemic norms matter?  \n<time>13:20</time> When epistemic norms conflict with moral norms  \n<time>17:38</time> The difference between knowledge and true beliefs  \n<time>19:50</time> Pointless beliefs, mundane beliefs, and interesting beliefs  \n<time>29:37</time> Nonstandard epistemic norms  \n<time>36:20</time> How to get at replacement norms  \n<time>46:56</time> Having good-enough beliefs  \n<time>49:37</time> Are epistemic norms categorical?  \n<time>52:16</time> Follow Dr. Talbot\u2019s work!\n\n\n---\n\nFollow Dr. Talbot\u2019s work:  \nFaculty page: https://bit.ly/3TyeLg1  \nWebsite: https://bit.ly/4aACP7O  \nPhilPeople profile: https://bit.ly/4awqrpy  \nThe End of Epistemology As We Know It: https://bit.ly/3TyMZjh\n",
