  \ in the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at the University of California,\
  \ Los Angeles, and a Professor at UCLA\u2019s Institute of the Environment and Sustainability.\
  \ He is a behavioral ecologist broadly interested in the evolution of behavior and\
  \ the application of behavioral and evolutionary principles to policy, health, and\
  \ defense. He has studied the behavior and ecology of mammals (including humans),\
  \ birds, fish, lizards, hermit crabs, and sea anemone, and runs the 50+ year project\

  \ of books like A Primer of Conservation Behavior, The Failure of Environmental\
  \ Education (And How We Can Fix It), and The Nature of Fear: Survival Lessons from\
  \ the Wild.\n\nIn this episode, we talk about predator-prey research. We get first\
  \ into antipredator behavior, and how it influences sociality, and we talk specifically\
  \ about alarm calling and escape strategies. We then talk about arms races between\
  \ predators and prey, and the sociality of predator species. Finally, we discuss\
  \ how knowledge about animal behavior, with a focus on antipredator behavior, might\
  \ play a role in the conservation of species.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:00 Intro  \n\
