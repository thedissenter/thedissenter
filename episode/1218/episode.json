	"shownotes": "RECORDED ON NOVEMBER 24th 2025.  \nDr. Edward Hagen is Professor of Evolutionary Anthropology at Washington State University. His research takes an evolutionary approach to non-infectious diseases, with a focus on mental health.\n\nIn this episode, we talk about Dr. Agust\u00edn Fuentes\u2019 book Sex Is a Spectrum, and we discuss whether sex is binary. We start by discussing his main argument, and then talk about the evolution of sex and anisogamy, how to define \u201cmale\u201d and \u201cfemale\u201d, the ratio of males to females, Thomas Laqueur\u2019s account of Western ideas about sex, the use of the terms \u201c3G males\u201d and \u201c3G females\u201d, and the Bateman gradient. We also talk about sexual selection, behavioral sex differences, and the sexual division of labor. We discuss the idea of humans as a biocultural species, and the distinction between sex and gender. We talk about intersex people, trans people, and human rights. We discuss what science would be giving up if it ditched the binary sex concept, and whether the sex binary can be harmful. Finally, we discuss whether the idea that sex is a spectrum is pseudoscience.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:35</time> Fuentes\u2019 main argument  \n<time>07:56</time> The evolution of sex and anisogamy  \n<time>27:04</time> Defining \u201cmale\u201d and \u201cfemale\u201d  \n<time>35:14</time> The ratio of males to females  \n<time>39:20</time> Thomas Laqueur\u2019s account of Western ideas about sex  \n<time>43:18</time> \u201c3G males\u201d and \u201c3G females\u201d  \n<time>48:32</time> The Bateman gradient  \n<time>52:29</time> Sexual selection, behavioral sex differences, and the sexual division of labor  \n<time>1:07:12</time> Humans as a biocultural species, and the distinction between sex and gender  \n<time>1:13:15</time> Intersex people, trans people, and human rights  \n<time>1:23:45</time> What would science be giving up if it ditched the binary sex concept?  \n<time>1:26:55</time> Can the sex binary be harmful?  \n<time>1:34:31</time> Is the idea that sex is a spectrum pseudoscience?  \n<time>1:39:09</time> Follow Dr. Hagen\u2019s work!\n\n---\n\nFollow Dr. Hagen\u2019s work:  \nFaculty Page: http://bit.ly/30t9d91  \nWSU Homepage: http://bit.ly/2Y2YW1U  \nResearchGate profile: http://bit.ly/35SNgSd  \nReview of Sex Is a Spectrum: https://tinyurl.com/2dp4k7ys  \nTwitter handle: @ed_hagen\n",
