	"shownotes": "RECORDED ON SEPTEMBER 11th 2023.  \nDr. Edward Hall is Norman E. Vuilleumier Professor of Philosophy at Harvard University. He works on a range of topics in metaphysics and epistemology that overlap with philosophy of science.\n\nIn this episode, we talk about the philosophy of causation, and the structure of reality. We start by discussing different approaches in the philosophy of causation, and how to think about causation across different fields of science. We also discuss the metaphysical status of causation, and how it relates to the compositional structure of reality, and the concept of fundamental laws of nature. Finally, we discuss whether the causal structure of a process is intrinsic to it.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:41</time> Approaches in the philosophy of causation  \n<time>07:34</time> Causation across different fields of science  \n<time>20:47</time> The metaphysical status of causation  \n<time>25:06</time> The compositional structure of reality  \n<time>39:30</time> Fundamental laws of nature  \n<time>45:11</time> Is the causal structure of a process intrinsic to it?  \n<time>53:36</time> Follow Dr. Hall\u2019s work!\n\n---\n\nFollow Dr. Hall\u2019s work:  \nFaculty page: https://bit.ly/3NV44Rm  \nPhilPeople profile: https://bit.ly/3XBz1xk\n",
