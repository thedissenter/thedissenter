  \ Remembering.\n\nIn this episode, we focus on Forgetting. We first talk about some\
  \ of the basics of how memory works. We then talk about forgetting, bot its benefits,\
  \ and conditions where it gets pathological, like Alzheimer\u2019s. We also talk\
  \ about PTDS and autism. Finally, we discuss if people should want to have better\
  \ memories, and if it is possible to improve memory.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:00  Intro\
