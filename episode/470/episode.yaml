shownotes: "RECORDED ON APRIL 23rd 2021.  \nDr. Olivier Sibony is Associate Professor\
  \ at HEC Paris. He is a writer, educator and consultant specializing in strategy,\
  \ strategic decision making and the organization of decision processes. His research\
  \ interests center on the effect of heuristics and biases in strategic decision\
  \ making and procedures to improve the quality of decisions. He is the author of\
  \ Cracked It!, You're About to Make a Terrible Mistake, and, more recently, Noise:\
  \ A Flaw in Human Judgment.\n\nIn this episode, we focus on Noise. We start with\
  \ some definitions of judgment, biases, and noise. We discuss if noise has causes\
  \ behind it. We talk about noise in specific instances, like regular vs. recurrent\
  \ decisions, and give examples in hiring decisions, insurance, student evaluation,\
  \ criminal punishment, medicine, weather forecasting, and others. We also talk about\
  \ predictive judgment. We tackle issues like group polarization and the wisdom of\
  \ crowds. Finally, we talk about solutions to tackle noise.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time>\
