  \nIn this episode, we talk about argumentation, reason, and disinformation. We start\
  \ with argumentation, and discuss what is it and what it is for; the contexts it\
  \ applies to; what is a valid argument; adversariality; the role of trust; argumentation\
  \ as a social phenomenon, and disagreements with Hugo Mercier and Dan Sperber; the\
  \ social epistemology of argumentation; and we also discuss if argumentation changes\
  \ minds. We then talk about reason, and a disagreement with Mercier\u2019s and Sperber\u2019\
  s modular nature of reason. Finally, we discuss disinformation, and if it is a new\
  \ phenomenon.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:00 Intro  \n01:20  What is argumentation, and\
