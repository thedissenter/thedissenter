We discuss whether taking a vaccine is a matter of individual liberty or collective responsibility. We explore the case of abortion. We talk about how science works, evidence, and uncertainty. We also talk about calculated risk in medicine, and the case of cancer. We discuss how important it is to trust the experts, and skepticism.
