	"shownotes": "RECORDED ON FEBRUARY 17th 2024.  \nDr. Jade d\u2019Alpoim Guedes is an Assistant Professor of Anthropology at the University of Washington, in Seattle. Dr. Guedes is an environmental archaeologist and ethnobiologist who employs an interdisciplinary research program to understand how humans adapted their foraging practices and agricultural strategies to new environments and have developed resilience in the face of climatic and social change.\n\nIn this episode, we focus on foraging, agriculture, crop dispersal, and climate change. We start by talking about foraging and farming in the Tibetan plateau, the transition from foraging to farming as a gradual process, why and how people settle down, and the advantages and disadvantages of moving to agriculture. We discuss the study of the geographical dispersal of crops through genetic analysis, how climate change impacted foraging societies in East Asia, the spread of agriculture across the globe, and how humans enhanced biodiversity in specific places. We also talk about the relationship between grain crops, non-grain crops, and the development of states; and millets, rice, and social complexity in China. Finally, we discuss how we can apply this knowledge to alleviating global hunger and enhancing food security, and climate change and its (future) impact on the global food system.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>01:09</time> Foraging and farming in the Tibetan plateau  \n<time>07:45</time> The transition from foraging to farming as a gradual process  \n<time>23:48</time> When do people settle down?  \n<time>26:25</time> The advantages and disadvantages of moving to agriculture  \n<time>31:42</time> Studying the geographical dispersal of crops through genetic analysis  \n<time>41:11</time> How climate change impacted foraging societies in East Asia  \n<time>47:47</time> The spread of agriculture across the globe  \n<time>50:47</time> Have humans had a positive impact on biodiversity in specific places?  \n<time>58:06</time> Grain crops, non-grain crops, and the development of states  \n<time>1:00:25</time> Millets, rice, and social complexity in China  \n<time>1:06:08</time> Alleviate global hunger and enhancing food security  \n<time>1:11:33</time> Climate change and its impact on the food system  \n<time>1:19:48</time> Follow Dr. Guedes\u2019 work!\n\n---\n\nFollow Dr. Guedes\u2019 work:  \nFaculty page: https://bit.ly/48qK0ym  \nWebsite: https://bit.ly/3PNuvtd  \nResearchGate profile: https://bit.ly/3FXwW6x  \nTwitter handle: @JadeArchaeobot\n",
