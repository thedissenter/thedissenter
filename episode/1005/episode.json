His latest book is Neuroethics: Agency in the Age of Brain Science. \n\nIn this episode, we focus on Neuroethics. We start by discussing what neuroethics is, and then we explore topics like free will; brain manipulation and medical interventions; mental disorder, stigma, and neurodiversity; addiction and brain diseases; moral enhancement; and neuromarketing. Finally, we talk about alarmism and neurohype, and how we can have a more nuanced and balanced approach to neuroscience and neuroethics.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:27</time> What is neuroethics?  \n<time>04:54</time> Free will  \n<time>25:21</time> Brain manipulation and medical interventions  \n<time>41:48</time> Mental disorder, stigma, and neurodiversity  \n<time>51:57</time> Addiction and brain diseases  \n<time>1:10:36</time> Moral enhancement  \n<time>1:23:05</time> Neuromarketing  \n<time>1:32:27</time> Alarmism and neurohype  \n<time>1:38:03</time> Follow Dr. May\u2019s work!\n\n---\n\nFollow Dr. May\u2019s work:  \nFaculty page: https://bit.ly/3EgpzX9  \nWebsite: https://bit.ly/3sxUKe5  \nPhilPeople profile: https://bit.ly/3qS2A1A  \nNeuroethics: https://bit.ly/3KYjulO\n",
