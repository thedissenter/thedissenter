His research looks at the behavioral and wellbeing effects of playing video games, and he is also interested in metascientific issues regarding best practice in digital technology effects research. He is the author of Lost in a Good Game, and more recently, Unlocked: The Real Science of Screen Time (and how to spend it better).\n\nIn this episode, we focus on Unlocked. We start by talking about moral panics surrounding new technologies and where they stem from. We discuss what screen time is, the link between social media use and mental health, whether screen-based technologies affect our sleep or our ability to focus, and whether they can be addictive. Finally, we talk about how we should approach screen-based technologies.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:40</time> Moral panics  \n<time>07:50</time> What is screen time?  \n<time>13:06</time> Social media and mental health  \n<time>32:50</time> Screen-based technologies and sleep  \n<time>41:27</time> Our ability to focus  \n<time>55:00</time> Addiction  \n<time>1:12:15</time> How should we approach screen-based technologies?  \n<time>1:19:17</time> Follow Dr. Etchells\u2019s work!\n\n---\n\nFollow Dr. Etchells\u2019s work:  \nFaculty page: https://tinyurl.com/2sprz9fr  \nWebsite: https://tinyurl.com/yd2j2avt  \nUnlocked: https://tinyurl.com/73ezyunu  \nTwitter handle: @PeteEtchells\n",
