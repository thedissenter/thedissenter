excerpt: Dr. Pasquale Raia is Professor of Paleontology and Paleoecology at the University
  of Naples Federico II. His scientific interests concern the evolution and the dynamics
  of extinction of animal species, and in particular the fossils of hominid species.
  His most notable scientific contributions regard evolutionary theories about the
  evolution of insular species, the complexity of organisms, and the dynamics of extinction
  of hominids.

  \ and Paleoecology at the University of Naples Federico II. His scientific interests\
  \ concern the evolution and the dynamics of extinction of animal species, and in\
  \ particular the fossils of hominid species. His most notable scientific contributions\
  \ regard evolutionary theories about the evolution of insular species, the complexity\
  \ of organisms, and the dynamics of extinction of hominids.\n\nIn this episode,\
  \ we start by talking about climate change as a factor in evolution, and what drives\
  \ the extinction of species. We discuss how increased specialization can be a problem.\
  \ We get into how climate change impacted the evolution of hominins. We talk about\
  \ why Neanderthals went extinct and H. sapiens survived, and how similar their cognitive\
  \ ability was. We discuss how H. sapiens was able to increase its habitable area.\
  \ We talk about what drove the extinction of Pleistocene megafauna. Finally, we\
  \ discuss the relationship between morphological integration and functional performance,\
  \ and how it influences evolution.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:00 Intro  \n00:51  Climate\
