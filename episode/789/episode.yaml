  \ the purpose of philosophy. We talk about what makes life hard, and we discuss\

  \ and what a life well lived is. We get into topics like physical disability and\
  \ pain; loneliness; friendship; loss and grief; Stoicism; being a \u201Cfailure\u201D\
  , and what \u201Csuccess\u201D means; injustice; and the meaning of life. Finally,\
  \ we discuss if argumentation can change people\u2019s views on life.\n\nTime Links:\
