shownotes: "RECORDED ON NOVEMBER 15th 2023.  \nDr. Nicholas Brown is a Researcher\
  \ at Linnaeus University, Sweden. He works on developing new research methods in\
  \ psychology and on applying meta-scientific perspectives on psychology as a science.\n\
  \nIn this episode, we start by discussing conceptual and methodological issues with\
  \ positive psychology and the study of well-being, and go through critiques of Lyubomirsky\u2019\
  s \u201Chappiness pie\u201D, and happiness surveys. We also address methodological\
  \ flaws with studies on the link between genetics and well-being, sadness and color\
  \ perception, and predicting heart disease from Twitter language. We then discuss\
  \ where bad science stems from, and talk about incentives, issues with the publishing\
  \ system, and how bad science goes unchecked. Finally, we talk about the idea of\
  \ trusting the experts, and rules of thumb to evaluate scientific evidence.\n\n\n\
