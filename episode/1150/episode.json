	"shownotes": "RECORDED ON SEPTEMBER 9th 2025.  \nDr. Mark Blyth is William R. Roads Professor of International Economics at Brown University. His research interests lie in the field of international political economy. More specifically, his research trespasses several fields and aims to be as interdisciplinary as possible, drawing from political science, economics, sociology, complexity theory, and evolutionary theory. His work falls into several related areas: the politics of ideas, how institutions change, political parties, and the politics of finance. His latest book is Inflation: A Guide for Users and Losers.\n\nIn this episode, we focus on Inflation. We discuss what inflation is, how to fight it, alternatives to raising interest rates, and what causes inflation. We talk about hyperinflation, and where there is a risk of the current inflation turning into hyperinflation. We discuss why we did not see this inflation coming, who the winners and losers of inflation are, and the effects of tariffs and trade wars on inflation. Finally, we discuss whether the future will be inflationary, and what people can do to prepare for it.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:28</time> The motivation to write the book  \n<time>03:03</time> What is inflation?  \n<time>06:48</time> How to fight inflation  \n<time>13:39</time> Alternatives to raising interest rates  \n<time>21:00</time> What causes inflation?  \n<time>27:55</time> What is hyperinflation?  \n<time>32:14</time> Why didn\u2019t we see this inflation coming?  \n<time>35:01</time> Who are the winners and losers of inflation?  \n<time>39:23</time> What are the effects of tariffs on inflation?  \n<time>41:24</time> Is the future inflationary?  \n<time>46:27</time> How should people prepare for the future?  \n<time>47:50</time> Follow Dr. Blyth\u2019s work!\n\n---\n\nFollow Dr. Blyth\u2019s work:  \nFaculty page: https://tinyurl.com/yc2ops4s  \nInflation: https://tinyurl.com/mryzwtr9  \nBooks: https://tinyurl.com/y8ruhfpy  \nTwitter handle: @MkBlyth\n",
