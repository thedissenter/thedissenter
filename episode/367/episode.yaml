excerpt: Dr. Christophe Heintz is Associate Professor at the Central European University,
  where he leads the research group ACE (Adaptive Cognition and Economics). Dr. Heintz
  is working on the role of adaptive cognition in shaping economic behavior, cultural
  evolution, and the history of science. Scientific practices and economic choices
  have traditionally been described as rational. He attempts to describe them as resulting
