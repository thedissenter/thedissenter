  \ we talk about artificial intelligence. We start by discussing what AI is, and\
  \ how it compares to natural intelligence. We then go into some of the issues we\
  \ have to worry about, like the ones related to security, controllability, and unexplainability\
  \ of AI. We talk about the Singularity, the concept, and what it could be like.\
