	"shownotes": "RECORDED ON FEBRUARY 14th 2025.  \nDr. John Odling-Smee is Emeritus Research Fellow at the Mansfield College at the University of Oxford. Prior to retirement, he lectured in Biological Anthropology at Oxford. He is the author of Niche Construction: How Life Contributes to Its Own Evolution.\n\nIn this episode, we focus on Niche Construction. We start by talking about physics and the second law of thermodynamics, what life is, the origin of life on Earth, living organisms as active and purposeful systems, and information and knowledge-gaining processes. We then discuss niche construction, how organisms coevolve with their environments, the origin and evolution of ecosystems, teleology, and developmental and sociocultural processes in social species. Finally, we talk about how humans are currently contributing to the evolution of life on Earth, and the extended evolutionary synthesis.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:28</time> The second law of thermodynamics  \n<time>02:28</time> What is life?  \n<time>06:52</time> Living organisms as active and purposeful systems  \n<time>07:56</time> Information, and knowledge-gaining processes  \n<time>12:15</time> What is niche construction?  \n<time>20:34</time> How organisms coevolve with their environments  \n<time>26:27</time> Examples of niche construction behaviors  \n<time>31:01</time> The evolution of ecosystems  \n<time>36:41</time> Teleology  \n<time>39:07</time> Developmental and sociocultural processes  \n<time>43:38</time> How are humans currently contributing to the evolution of life on Earth?  \n<time>47:11</time> The extended evolutionary synthesis  \n<time>51:53</time> Follow Dr. Odling-Smee\u2019s work!\n\n---\n\nFollow Dr. Odling-Smee\u2019s work:  \nExtended Evolutionary Synthesis page: https://tinyurl.com/2uj8uru2  \nNiche Construction: https://tinyurl.com/mr2thtkf\n",
