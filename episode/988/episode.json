We first discuss what emotion is, its importance to mental health, how emotion relates to cognition, and good and bad emotions. We then talk about emotion regulation, the factors that play a role in it, the role of context, and gender differences in emotion regulation. We discuss the role of culture in mental health, and how to improve emotion regulation, particularly through cognitive behavioral therapy and mindfulness. Finally, we discuss the paradoxical effects of valuing and seeking happiness.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:45</time> What is emotion?  \n<time>02:40</time> The importance of emotions for mental health  \n<time>05:24</time> Emotion and cognition  \n<time>16:21</time> Good and bad emotions  \n<time>25:59</time> Emotion regulation  \n<time>32:53</time> Factors that play a role in emotion regulation  \n<time>37:56</time> The role of context  \n<time>51:31</time> Gender differences  \n<time>58:31</time> The role of culture in mental health  \n<time>1:03:18</time> How to improve emotion regulation  \n<time>1:01:53</time> CBT and mindfulness  \n<time>1:19:39</time> The paradoxical effects of seeking happiness  \n<time>1:38:41</time> Follow Dr. Mauss\u2019 work!\n\n---\n\nFollow Dr. Mauss\u2019 work:  \nFaculty page: https://bit.ly/47zMPMm  \nGoogle Scholar page: https://bit.ly/46oEZEe  \nTwitter handle: @IrisMauss\n",
