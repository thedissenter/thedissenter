excerpt: Dr. Kristen Syme is research associate at the Faculty of Behavioral and Movement
  Sciences at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam. She received her BA in anthropology from
  the University of Delaware where she developed an interest in using evolutionary
  theory to investigate mental health and behavioral phenomena that are diagnosed
  and treated as diseases and deviations according to the Western medical paradigm.
  She conducted her MA research on suicidal behavior in 53 cultures and received her
  MA in 2014. Her research interests broadly concern the evolved interpersonal functions
  of psychological and behavioral phenomena. Her MA thesis tested two evolutionary
  models of suicidal behavior against the ethnographic record, and my dissertation
  research is a continuation of this project. She is presently conducting an exploratory
  investigation on bargaining strategies and parent-offspring conflict with an immigrant
  Micronesian population in the Vancouver WA/Portland, OR area.

  \ at the Faculty of Behavioral and Movement Sciences at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam.\
  \ She received her BA in anthropology from the University of Delaware where she\
  \ developed an interest in using evolutionary theory to investigate mental health\
  \ and behavioral phenomena that are diagnosed and treated as diseases and deviations\
  \ according to the Western medical paradigm. She conducted her MA research on suicidal\

  \ She is presently conducting an exploratory investigation on bargaining strategies\
  \ and parent-offspring conflict with an immigrant Micronesian population in the\
  \ Vancouver WA/Portland, OR area.\n\nIn this episode, we talk about mental disorders\
  \ from an anthropological perspective, suicidal behavior, and leadership. We start\
  \ by mentioning how to think about mental disorders as cultural constructs. We discuss\
  \ mental illness in modern society. We ask if mental disorders are diseases. We\
  \ then get into suicide, and discuss it from an evolutionary perspective, including\
  \ the bargaining and inclusive fitness models of suicide. We also talk about preventing\
  \ suicide, and the power imbalance in the mental health professional/patient relationship.\
