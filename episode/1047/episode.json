We talk about procrastination and how we can deal with it. We discuss note-taking, summarization, and the 3R method: read, recite, and review. We talk about academic integrity, the issue of plagiarism, writing assessments at degree level, the challenges of working collaboratively in academia, and common mistakes in delivering presentations.
