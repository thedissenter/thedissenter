He is the author of A History of Fake Things on the Internet.\n\nIn this episode, we focus on A History of Fake Things on the Internet. We talk about the broader history of fakeries, how we relate to reality and myth. We then get into the history of fake things on the internet, and discuss how much of the internet is fake; the motivations behind the creation of fake content, whether people fall for fake content; video editing, and deep fakes; and shock-content websites.
