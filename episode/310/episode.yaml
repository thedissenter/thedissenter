excerpt: 'Dr. Hal Whitehead is Professor in the Department of Biology at Dalhousie
  University. His work focuses mainly on the behavior, ecology, population biology
  and conservation of two species of deep-diving whale: the sperm and northern bottlenose.
  He and his team have ongoing research projects on sperm whales in the eastern Pacific
  (since 1985) and Atlantic (since 2004) on northern bottlenose whales off Nova Scotia
  (since 1998), and on pilot whales off Nova Scotia Isince 1998). They spend periods
  of weeks at sea on board ocean-going sailing boats collecting acoustic, visual,
  photographic, genetic and oceanographic data.'

  \ Department of Biology at Dalhousie University. His work focuses mainly on the\
  \ behavior, ecology, population biology and conservation of two species of deep-diving\
  \ whale: the sperm and northern bottlenose. He and his team have ongoing research\
  \ projects on sperm whales in the eastern Pacific (since 1985) and Atlantic (since\
  \ 2004) on northern bottlenose whales off Nova Scotia (since 1998), and on pilot\
  \ whales off Nova Scotia Isince 1998). They spend periods of weeks at sea on board\
  \ ocean-going sailing boats collecting acoustic, visual, photographic, genetic and\
  \ oceanographic data.\n\nIn this episode, we talk about several aspects of whale\
  \ sociality, focusing on the ones Dr. Whitehouse studies the most, like the sperm\
  \ whale, the northern bottlenose whale, and the pilot whale. We discuss parental\
  \ investment, alloparenting, and menopause. We talk about how their social networks\
  \ are established, and how they relate to their culture. We address whale culture\
  \ in general, and also how they have cumulative culture, and some examples of gene-culture\
  \ coevolution in whales and dolphins. Finally, we refer to whale conservation.\n\

  \ go through menopause. Do they become grandmothers?  \n16:34  Social networks,\
  \ and multilevel animal societies  \n26:17  Whale culture   \n32:22  Do whales have\
  \ cumulative culture?  \n36:39  Gene-culture coevolution in whales and dolphins\
  \  \n44:50  Can we understand culture in general better by studying whale culture?\
