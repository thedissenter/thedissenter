  \ Virtue.\n\nIn this episode, we talk about the virtues of generosity and patience.\
  \ We start with generosity, and discuss the distinction between generous actions,\
  \ acting from generosity, and being a generous person. We also discuss if generous\
  \ actions need to be costly, why motivation matters, if the action needs to be freely\
  \ done, what makes someone a generous person, and how generous we tend to be. We\
  \ then get into patience, and talk about the importance of goals, time, emotions,\
  \ and motivation in patience. We also address general questions about the virtues,\
  \ including what they are really about \u2013 character, or the good they bring\
  \ to other people -; the difference between continence and virtue; and moral and\
  \ epistemic/intellectual virtues.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:00 Intro  \n00:37  Generosity\
