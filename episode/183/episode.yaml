  Planetary Science Institute and holds a joint appointment as an associate professor
  in the Research School of Astronomy and Astrophysics and the Research School of
  Earth Sciences. He was a member of the COBE satellite team that discovered the temperature
  fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background. Before his appointment at ANU,

  \ Planetary Science Institute and holds a joint appointment as an associate professor\
  \ in the Research School of Astronomy and Astrophysics and the Research School of\

  \ \"Are We Alone?\". His research areas include cosmology, exoplanetology, and astrobiology\
  \ and evolutionary biology. \n\nIn this episode, we talk about astrobiology. We\
  \ go through some general topics, like complexity in the Universe; Darwinian and\
  \ Lamarckian evolution; multilevel selection; looking for life on other planets,\
  \ the extremophile life forms, and if we could find life that is not carbon-based,\
  \ and related issues. In the end, we also discuss the scientific relevance of discovering\
  \ life elsewhere, and also the new perspective it would bring to humanity.\n\nTime\
