We start by framing the debate between people who are in favor and against human extinction, and we talk about the different kinds of extinction, and arguments in favor and against human extinction.

We talk about antinatalism, longtermism, and Dr. May\u2019s own position.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:25</time> Framing the debate  \n<time>04:14</time> Kinds of extinction  \n<time>08:51</time> Arguments in favor and against human extinction  \n<time>17:44</time> The value humanity brings to the world  \n<time>21:33</time> Antinatalism  \n<time>24:58</time> The harms that we bring to the world  \n<time>28:35</time> Longtermism  \n<time>31:59</time> Dr. May\u2019s own position  \n<time>34:35</time> Follow Dr. May\u2019s work!\n\n---\n\nFollow Dr. May\u2019s work:  \nWebsite: https://tinyurl.com/3vz7mv9k  \nPhilPeople profile: https://tinyurl.com/2duxseup  \nShould We Gog Extinct?: https://tinyurl.com/8rfej3s6\n",
