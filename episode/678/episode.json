We first talk about the societies Dr. Herdt studied in Papua New Guinea. We then discuss how to study sexuality on the field, how sexual attraction develops, the influence of culture in the development of sexual orientation, and norms regarding sexual behavior. We talk about how to understand homosexuality from the perspective of anthropology. Finally, we talk about factors that impact the mental health of homosexuals, including norms, marriage denial, and discrimination due to the AIDS pandemic.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:46</time> Societies in Papua New Guinea  \n<time>05:28</time> How to study sexuality on the field  \n<time>11:27</time> How sexual attraction develops  \n<time>18:30</time> Does culture influence the development of sexual orientation?  \n<time>22:14</time> Norms regarding sexual behavior  \n<time>30:57</time> Are traditional societies tolerant of homosexuality?  \n<time>33:56</time> Homosexuality from the perspective of anthropology  \n<time>39:53</time> Factors that impact the mental health of homosexuals: norms, marriage denial, the AIDS pandemic  \n<time>53:01</time> Follow Dr. Herdt’s work!\n\n---\n\nFollow Dr. Herdt’s work:  \nFaculty page: https://bit.ly/3sjl9tn  \nResearchGate profile: https://bit.ly/35xc7zV  \nBooks on Amazon: https://amzn.to/3NLm3Xn\n",
