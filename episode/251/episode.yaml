  \ in Evolutionary Psychology at the University of Texas, Austin, US, under the supervision\
  \ of David Buss. She is currently a senior lecturer of Psychology at the University\
  \ of Portsmouth, as well as a member of the Comparative and Evolutionary Psychology\
  \ group there. Her research interests are hormonal influences on behavior, human\
  \ sexuality, disgust and, recently, the interface of evolutionary psychology and\
  \ behaviorism.\n\nIn this episode, we talk about the evolutionary psychology of\
  \ sex robots, and how they might impact men and human society. We talk about why\
  \ men will be the primary marketing targets, and the several different ways sex\
  \ robots might have a positive impact in their lives. During the discussion, we\
  \ also tackle arguments against sex robots, or arguments that suggest their impact\
  \ might be net negative. \n\nTime Links:  \n01:20  Evolutionary psychology, and\
  \ sex robots as an emergent technology  \n06:44  Could there be sex robots for women?\
