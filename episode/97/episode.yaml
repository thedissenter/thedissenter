  \ Oakland University. Her primary research interests are in two overlapping areas:\
  \ animal cognition, and cognitive development. The underlying goal of her work is\
  \ to examine cognitive continuities and discontinuities between humans and both\

  \ to talk about what is comparative psychology; how we can apply evolutionary principles\
  \ to better compare cognition between different species; the importance of studying\
  \ how a trait develops during the lifetime of a species; the problem with anthropocentric\
  \ approaches to studying other species; in what ways humans are different, and also\
  \ how other animals might have some superior abilities; and, finally, the issue\
  \ with studying animals in the wild and in the lab.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:44  What\
