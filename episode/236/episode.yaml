shownotes: "RECORDED ON SEPTEMBER 12th, 2019.  \nSORRY ABOUT THE ISSUES WITH THE VIDEO\
  \ QUALITY. THE CONNECTION WAS A BIT WEAK.  \nDr. Sarah Hill is Associate Professor\
  \ of Psychology at Texas Christian University. She studies a range of topics, applying\
  \ an evolutionary lens, including the interplay between immune function and mating\
  \ strategies; the impact of inflammation; poverty, food regulation, and weight gain;\
  \ hormonal contraceptives and mate choice; and other topics under the rubric of\
  \ life history theory. She is just about to release a book, This Is Your Brain on\
  \ Birth Control: The Surprising Science of Women, Hormones, and the Law of Unintended\
  \ Consequences.\n\nIn this episode, we focus on Dr. Hill\u2019s upcoming book, This\
  \ is Your Brain on Birth Control, and go through some of its main topics, like:\
  \ how women\u2019s behavior changes through their menstrual cycles, and the ovulatory-shift\
  \ hypothesis; concealed ovulation; the different types of birth control, and their\
  \ effects on women and people around them. We also talk about why studying biological\
  \ sex differences is important and is not dangerous at all, the ways the pill empowered\
  \ women, and also how it might have changed the dynamics in the mating market, including\
  \ their effects on men.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:52  The premise of This Is Your Brain\
