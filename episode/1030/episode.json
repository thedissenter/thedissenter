	"shownotes": "RECORDED ON AUGUST 8th 2024.  \nDr. Joel Marks is professor emeritus of philosophy at the University of New Haven and a Bioethics Center Scholar at Yale University. His main areas of scholarly interest have been theoretical and applied ethics, both having come together in recent years in thinking about animal ethics. Meanwhile a new area of interest is planetary defense (against comets and asteroids). He is the author of several books, including the latest one, The Spread: and other essays on moralism and guilt.\n\nIn this episode, we focus on The Spread. We start by discussing where morals stem from; the roles of blaming, guilt, and shame; and what \u201cobjective moral values\u201d really mean. We talk about a scientific account of morality. We discuss whether if makes sense for atheists to believe in objective moral values. We talk about desirism, rationality, and analetheism (is truth real?). Finally, we discuss whether it would be feasible to abolish morality, and if amoralists would just be immoral people.\n\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:49</time> Where do morals stem from?  \n<time>04:50</time> The roles of blaming, guilt, and shame  \n<time>11:10</time> What do \u201cobjective moral values\u201d mean?  \n<time>18:46</time> A scientific account of morality  \n<time>24:10</time> Does it make sense for atheists to believe in objective moral values?  \n<time>27:42</time> Desirism  \n<time>32:06</time> Rationality  \n<time>51:10</time> Analetheism: is truth real?  \n<time>59:19</time> Is it feasible to abolish morality?  \n<time>1:04:49</time> Would amoralists just be immoral?  \n<time>1:09:07</time> Follow Dr. Marks\u2019 work!\n\n---\n\nFollow Dr. Marks\u2019 work:  \nOur first interview: https://youtu.be/xFWNCk9W59Q  \nFaculty page: https://bit.ly/3jqdwg8  \nDocsoc.com: https://bit.ly/3zBQ1HN  \nPhilPeople profile: https://bit.ly/3yYLs9X  \nAmazon page: https://amzn.to/3gDRepw\n",
