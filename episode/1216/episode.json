	"shownotes": "RECORDED ON OCTOBER 28th 2025.  \nLaura Carroll is a nonfiction author, expert on the childfree choice and pronatalism, and a passionate reproductive rights and ethics advocate. She is the author of The Baby Matrix: Why Freeing Our Minds From Outmoded Thinking About Parenthood & Reproduction Will Create a Better World.\n\nIn this episode, we talk about childfree choices and pronatalism. We first get into what it is to be childfree, why people morally condemn childfree choices, whether most people without children are \u201cchildless by circumstance\u201d, whether people with children are happier, whether we have evolved to want children, and whether people want large families. We also discuss whether we are headed toward \u201cpopulation collapse\u201d, whether aging populations need more babies, the link between pronatalism and eugenics, and whether pronatalism is a threat to women\u2019s reproductive rights.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:42</time> What it is to be childfree  \n<time>06:00</time> Why do people morally condemn childfree choices?  \n<time>07:37</time> Are most people without children \u201cchildless by circumstance\u201d?  \n<time>12:32</time> Are people with children happier?  \n<time>17:10</time> Have we evolved to want children?  \n<time>22:48</time> Do people want large families?  \n<time>33:31</time> Are we headed toward \u201cpopulation collapse\u201d?  \n<time>40:04</time> Do aging populations need more babies?  \n<time>49:06</time> Is pronatalism linked to eugenics?  \n<time>50:09</time> Is pronatalism a threat to women\u2019s reproductive rights?  \n<time>59:18</time> Follow Laura\u2019s work!\n\n---\n\nFollow Laura\u2019s work:  \nWebsite: https://lauracarroll.com/  \nThe Baby Matrix: https://tinyurl.com/mshsvz6t\n",
