We then talk about masturbation in animals, masturbation in early civilization, and when masturbation was turned into a sin and a disease. We discuss masturbation in utero and the development of childhood masturbation. We debunk claims made by the NoFap movement and people who promote semen retention. We talk about what science really says about masturbation. We discuss whether there is such a thing as masturbation addiction. We then get into claims made by anti-porn feminists, and discuss whether porn addiction is real, whether porn is psychologically harmful, and whether it is harmful to children. Finally, we talk about the importance of sex education.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:29</time> Why a book on masturbation?  \n<time>01:41</time> Masturbation in animals  \n<time>04:41</time> Masturbation in early civilization  \n<time>07:12</time> Masturbation as a sin or a disease, and the anti-masturbation crusaders  \n<time>18:51</time> Masturbation in utero and childhood masturbation  \n<time>28:16</time> NoFap and semen retention claims  \n<time>31:55</time> What science says about masturbation  \n<time>35:58</time> Is there such a thing as masturbation addiction?  \n<time>55:47</time> Anti-pornography claims and the anti-porn feminists  \n<time>1:05:40</time> Is there such a thing as pornography addiction?  \n<time>1:07:39</time> Is porn psychologically harmful?  \n<time>1:16:37</time> Does porn harm children?  \n<time>1:19:54</time> The importance of sex education  \n<time>1:22:54</time> Follow Dr. Sprankle\u2019s work!\n\n---\n\nFollow Dr. Sprankle\u2019s work:  \nFaculty page: https://tinyurl.com/8xm3rp5h  \nWebsite: https://www.drsprankle.com/  \nDIY: https://tinyurl.com/mrysmy8w  \nX handle: @DrSprankle\n",
