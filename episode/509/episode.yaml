  \ \u2013 with a particular focus on the challenges and opportunities provided by\
  \ new media.\n\nIn this episode, we talk about social media, political communication,\
  \ fake news and misinformation, and political polarization. We start with the benefits\
  \ and challenges of social media. We talk specifically about Facebook escapism.\
  \ We distinguish between fake news, political disinformation, and political misinformation,\
  \ and discuss if they really are widespread phenomena. We also address political\
  \ polarization, and what might be its causes. We ask if the way people engage with\
  \ politics online differs from how they do it in their offline lives.\n\nTime Links:\
