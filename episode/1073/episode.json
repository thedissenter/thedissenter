	"shownotes": "RECORDED ON NOVEMBER 25th 2024.  \nDr. David Wolpert is a Professor at the Santa Fe Institute, external professor at the Complexity Science Hub in Vienna, adjunct professor at ASU, and research associate at the ICTP in Trieste. He has over 30,000 citations, with most of his papers in thermodynamics of computation, foundations of physics, dynamics of social organizations, machine learning, game theory, and distributed optimization / control.\n\nIn this episode, we focus on his paper, \u201cThe Past as a Stochastic Process\u201d. We first talk about what a stochastic process is, how to study history, a stochastic process framework, and history itself as a stochastic process. We also discuss the jumps in the sociopolitical complexity of polities, narrative approaches in history, and predicting the future.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:39</time> What is a stochastic process?  \n<time>04:01</time> Studying history  \n<time>11:03</time> A stochastic process framework  \n<time>17:40</time> History as a stochastic process  \n<time>19:29</time> The sociopolitical complexity of polities  \n<time>21:29</time> Narrative approaches in history  \n<time>25:22</time> Predicting the future  \n<time>30:07</time> Follow Dr. Wolpert\u2019s work!\n\n---\n\nFollow Dr. Wolpert\u2019s work:  \nFaculty page: https://shorturl.at/Cpnxc  \nResearchGate profile: https://shorturl.at/3CTqT  \nThe Past as a Stochastic Process: https://shorturl.at/qgIUX\n",
