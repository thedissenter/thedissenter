shownotes: "Dr. April Bleske-Rechek is a Professor of Psychology at the University\
  \ of Wisconsin-Eau Claire. As a researcher, she focuses on human mating, friendship,\
  \ cognitive abilities and intellectual giftedness, and science literacy.  \nIn this\
  \ episode, the conversation revolves around the evolutionary psychology of friendship\
  \ and mate selection. She gives a personal account of the development and importance\
  \ of evolutionary psychology. And then we move on to talk same-sex and opposite-sex\
  \ friendship; friendship rivalry and its bases; the evolutionary bases of friendship;\
  \ sex differences in friendship initiation and dissolution; the studying of friendship\
  \ and mate preferences; cues and signals in mate selection, and clarifying the difference\
  \ between waist-to-hip ratio and body mass index; exaggerated physical cues and\
  \ pornography; the effects of pornography in men\u2019s minds; advantages and disadvantages\
  \ of sex robots; assortative mating, and its evolutionary advantages; a specific\
  \ study of Dr. Bleske-Rechek\u2019s involving the trolley problem; the contribution\
  \ of evolutionary psychology to human relationships; if evolutionary psychology\
  \ should be the core theory of modern Psychology, and why; if Psychology should\
  \ be looked at as a branch of Biology; and the relationship between Evolutionary\
  \ Psychology and Behavioral Genetics. \n\nTime Links:  \n00:32  Dr. Bleske-Rechek\u2019\
