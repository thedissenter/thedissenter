	"shownotes": "RECORDED ON SEPTEMBER 25th 2025.  \nDr. Jennifer Nagel is a Professor in the Department of Philosophy at the University of Toronto. Her research focuses on knowledge, belief, and our capacities to track these states in ourselves and others. Dr. Nagel is interested in the history of epistemology, both in the Western tradition back to Plato, and in the Classical Indian and Tibetan traditions. She also works in contemporary philosophy of mind, with special interests in metacognition and mental state attribution.\n\nIn this episode, we first talk about epistemic intuitions: what they are; how philosophers approach them; and how linguistics and psychology approach epistemic intuitions: We discuss knowledge, what makes knowledge reliable, whether it is a mental state, the difference between knowing something and just happening to be right about it, the epistemic value of reflection, and common knowledge. Finally, we talk about the relationship between experimental philosophy and traditional philosophy.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:37</time> Epistemic intuitions  \n<time>03:49</time> How philosophers approach epistemic intuitions  \n<time>12:35</time> How linguistics and psychology approach epistemic intuitions  \n<time>19:44</time> What is knowledge?  \n<time>27:17</time> Is knowledge a mental state?  \n<time>30:45</time> The difference between knowing something and just happening to be right about it  \n<time>34:19</time> The epistemic value of reflection  \n<time>39:04</time> Common knowledge  \n<time>51:43</time> The relationship between experimental philosophy and traditional philosophy  \n<time>1:01:17</time> Follow Dr. Nagel\u2019s work!\n\n---\n\nFollow Dr. Nagel\u2019s work:  \nFaculty page: https://tinyurl.com/pzpzkp8f  \nWebsite: https://jennifernagel.net/  \nPhilPeople profile: https://tinyurl.com/4tbn2fmk\n",
