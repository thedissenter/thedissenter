	"shownotes": "RECORDED ON OCTOBER 23rd 2023.  \nR\u00e9ka Blazsek is a PhD candidate at the ACES Lab (Adaptive Cognition & Economics in Society) of the Department of Cognitive Science at Central European University. She is interested in the cognitive and evolutionary roots of economic and political institutions. In other words: what are the links between the design of the mind and the design of institutions? She aims to tackle this topic by focusing on the cognitive foundations of ownership.\n\nIn this episode, we start by talking about how social minds may generate societal phenomena. We discuss coordination games, and how they can be used to model social norms. We then get specifically into ownership, the domains of our lives it applies to, and where beliefs about ownership come from. In the second part of the interview, we talk about mental health in PhD students, and the challenges they go through.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:51</time> How social minds may generate societal phenomena  \n<time>12:12</time> Modelling social norms with coordination games  \n<time>16:34</time> Ownership  \n<time>22:43</time> Where beliefs about ownership come from  \n<time>33:08</time> Mental health in PhD students  \n<time>1:00:01</time> Follow R\u00e9ka\u2019s work!\n\n---\n\nFollow R\u00e9ka\u2019s work:  \nUniversity page: https://bit.ly/3qMTrHB  \nWebsite: https://bit.ly/3KTaxKI  \nTwitter handle: @reka_roxana\n",
