	"shownotes": "RECORDED ON JUNE 11th 2025.  \nDr. Javier Su\u00e1rez is Lecturer in the Department of Philosophy at the Universidad de Oviedo. He is a philosopher of biology interested in the study of symbiotic interactions, and their implications for philosophy of biology (the concept of natural selection, the definition of species, etc.), and general philosophy of science (explanation, modelling, methodology of science, etc.). He is the author (with Elisabeth A. Lloyd) of Units of Selection (Cambridge University Press).\n\nIn this episode, we focus on Units of Selection. We start by discussing the debate surrounding units of selection in evolutionary biology. We talk about the Adaptationist and Evolutionary Change Schools, and the Disambiguation Project and the Unitary Project. We discuss three different concepts of \u201cunit of selection\u201d: interactor, replicator/reproducer/reconstitutor, and manifestor of adaptation/type-1 agent. Finally, we talk about the Evolutionary Transitions in Individuality framework.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:33</time> The debate surrounding units of selection  \n<time>06:13</time> Adaptationist and Evolutionary Change Schools  \n<time>07:30</time> The Disambiguation Project and the Unitary Project  \n<time>10:49</time> Group selection  \n<time>11:52</time> Three different concepts of \u201cunit of selection\u201d  \n<time>24:57</time> The Evolutionary Transitions in Individuality framework  \n<time>33:23</time> Follow Dr. Su\u00e1rez\u2019s work!\n\n---\n\nFollow Dr. Su\u00e1rez\u2019s work:  \nFaculty page: https://tinyurl.com/4cc4j8z9  \nResearchGate profile: https://tinyurl.com/2mnsessn  \nUnits of Selection: https://tinyurl.com/yc7bdth9\n",
