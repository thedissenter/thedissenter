	"shownotes": "RECORDED ON MARCH 13th 2025.  \nDr. Mandi Astola is Assistant Professor of Philosophy at the Delft University of Technology. Her research focuses on character: what good and bad character traits are like, why they are good or bad, and whether their status as good or bad changes according to context, and whether groups have a character which we can evaluate morally and epistemically.\n\nIn this episode, we talk about character, virtue, and vice. We start by discussing what character is. We then talk about virtues and vices, virtue ethics and virtue epistemology, sense of humor as a virtue, group character, collective intelligence, and collective virtues and vices. Finally, we discuss Mandevillian virtues and vices, and whether sometimes individual vices can be good.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:38</time> What is character?  \n<time>06:37</time> Virtues and vices  \n<time>08:57</time> Virtue ethics and virtue epistemology  \n<time>16:28</time> Sense of humor  \n<time>21:16</time> Group character  \n<time>23:37</time> Collective intelligence  \n<time>30:13</time> Collective virtues and vices  \n<time>40:15</time> Are virtues always virtues and vices always vices?  \n<time>42:06</time> Mandevillian virtues  \n<time>53:01</time> Mandevillian vices  \n<time>56:04</time> Are sometimes individual vices good?  \n<time>57:57</time> Virtue theory  \n<time>1:03:45</time> Follow Dr. Astola\u2019s work!\n\n---\n\nFollow Dr. Astola\u2019s work:  \nFaculty page: https://tinyurl.com/4hhhezaa  \nWebsite: https://mandiastola.com/  \nPhilPeople profile: https://tinyurl.com/4dptdbzp\n",
