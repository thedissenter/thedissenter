	"shownotes": "RECORDED ON SEPTEMBER 24th 2024.  \nDr. Andy Clark is Professor of Cognitive Philosophy at the University of Sussex. His academic interests include artificial intelligence, embodied and extended cognition, robotics, and computational neuroscience. He is the author of several books, the latest one being The Experience Machine: How Our Minds Predict and Shape Reality.\n\nIn this episode, we focus on The Experience Machine. We start by exploring the ideas of the brain as a prediction machine, and perception as controlled hallucination. We talk about the relationship between perception and objective reality, the role of expectation, illusions, and 4E cognition and the extended mind. We discuss implications that this framework would have for psychiatry and how we understand mental illness. We also talk about emotion, and the hard problem of consciousness. Finally, we discuss ways by which we can take control of our own experiences, and the effects of psychedelics and meditation.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:31</time> The brain as a prediction machine  \n<time>08:50</time> Perception as controlled hallucination  \n<time>13:42</time> Perception and objective reality  \n<time>19:23</time> The role of expectation  \n<time>23:41</time> Illusions  \n<time>29:54</time> 4E cognition and the extended mind  \n<time>40:40</time> Implications for psychiatry and how we understand mental illness  \n<time>56:04</time> What is emotion?  \n<time>1:01:47</time> The hard problem of consciousness  \n<time>1:07:46</time> Ways of taking control of our experiences  \n<time>1:11:58</time> Psychedelics and meditation  \n<time>1:17:39</time> Follow Dr. Clark\u2019s work!\n\n---\n\nFollow Dr. Clark\u2019s work:  \nFaculty page: https://tinyurl.com/4sd2ayrs  \nResearchGate profile: https://tinyurl.com/2ny86dnf  \nThe Experience Machine: https://tinyurl.com/yh52xw39  \nTwitter handle: @CogsAndy\n",
