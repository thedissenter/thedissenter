  \ of several books, including the most recent one, Survival of the Friendliest:\
  \ Understanding Our Origins and Rediscovering Our Common Humanity.\n\nIn this episode,\
  \ we talk about his book, Survival of the Friendliest. First, we go through some\
  \ of the psychological mechanism that allow for our friendliness, and later we also\
  \ refer to empathy, self-control, and theory of mind. We discuss the process of\
  \ self-domestication. We also talk about simianization, Social Dominance Orientation\
  \ (SDO) and Right Wing Authoritarianism (RWA), and ways to increase our friendliness\
  \ toward out-groups.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:53  The psychological ingredients for\
