	"shownotes": "RECORDED ON FEBRUARY 9th 2024.  \nDr. Erica Cartmill is Professor of Cognitive Science, Anthropology, and Animal Behavior at Indiana University. She studies the acquisition and evolution of human language. Her work bridges the biological and linguistic subfields and involves both comparative and developmental approaches to communication. She is interested in how the multimodal aspects of communication contribute to and constrain the construction of meaning in spontaneous interaction. She is particularly interested in whether gesture played a role in the origins of human language.\n\nIn this episode, we talk about the evolution of gestures and human language. We start by discussing how old are gestures in evolution, what counts as a gesture, whether ape gestures are intentional, how flexible are ape gestures, whether they are innate or learned, and whether they have meanings. We also discuss whether they share features with human language. We talk about how gestures aid cognition. Finally, we discuss the future of gesture research.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:42</time> How old are gestures in evolution?  \n<time>06:18</time> What counts as a gesture?  \n<time>21:36</time> Are ape gestures intentional?  \n<time>30:12</time> How flexible are their gestures?  \n<time>32:56</time> Are ape gestures innate or learned?  \n<time>41:00</time> Do their gestures have meanings?  \n<time>54:02</time> Do ape gestures share features with human language?  \n<time>1:03:02</time> How gestures aid cognition  \n<time>1:11:10</time> The future of gesture research  \n<time>1:20:15</time> Follow Dr. Cartmill\u2019s work!\n\n---\n\nFollow Dr. Cartmill\u2019s work:  \nFaculty page: https://bit.ly/3SH4yMi  \nGoogle Scholar page: https://bit.ly/3FhMwcV\n",
