  \ was a winner of the World Bank's Innovation Challenge Prize and the International\
  \ Society for Human Ethology's Linda Mealey Award. He is widely published in scholarly\
  \ journals and print media, and is a frequently-invited speaker at international\
  \ conferences. He is a Master of Public Administration (MPA) graduate of Harvard\
  \ University's John F. Kennedy School of Government, as well as a Bachelor of psychology\
  \ graduate from Rutgers. He was also a member of the Harvard Behavioral Insights\
  \ Group.  \nThey are both project co-leaders of PsychTable.\n\nThis is a new series\
  \ that we are trying to start on my channel/podcast, which will be called \u201C\
  RoundTable\u201D, and where we will be having conversations with people involving\
  \ the theoretical foundations of PsychTable, including people that are working on\
  \ different Evolved Psychological Adaptations (EPAs).\n\nIn this first episode,\
  \ we talk about what PsychTable is about, and how it will be built. We discuss the\
  \ criteria used to classify something as an EPA; the kinds of EPAs that would be\
  \ considered (including cultural and group-level EPAs); who would be able to access\
  \ it, and how the evidence would be weighted; and who would benefit from it, and\
  \ in what ways. We also talk a bit about the relationship between psychological\
  \ adaptations and mental modules.\n\nTime Links:  \n01:50  What is PsychTable? \
  \ \n04:50  How would it be built?  \n08:00  The criteria to classify something as\

  \                \n15:42  How would the evidence be weighted and evaluated?  \n\
  31:43  What about group-level and cultural adaptations?  \n42:20  Is there any relationship\
  \ between psychological adaptations and modules?  \n49:09  Who would benefit from\
  \ PsychTable, and how?  \n56:10  Check out PsychTable, and Dan and Niruban\u2019\
