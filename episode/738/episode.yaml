shownotes: "RECORDED ON NOVEMBER 4th 2022.  \nDr. Antoine Marie is a Postdoctoral\
  \ Researcher at the Department of Political Science at Aarhus University, Denmark.\
  \ He is an evolutionary political psychologist with a background in philosophy,\
  \ sociology, political science, and social psychology. He conducts cross-cultural\
  \ psychology experiments and develops evolutionary theory to better understand,\
  \ and if possible, mitigate, the cognitive biases that arise from people having\
  \ strong moral convictions on controversial topics, typically in contexts of perceived\
  \ intergroup conflict.\n\nIn this episode, we talk about moral and political psychology.\
  \ We first discuss morality from an evolutionary perspective, including its social\
  \ functions. We talk about why people develop strong moral convictions, and the\
  \ phenomenon of moral rigidity. We discuss if morality translates directly into\
  \ political attitudes, and the link between dogmaticism and inter-group conflict.\
  \ We then get into the cognitive foundations of misinformation, and what makes people\
  \ susceptible to misinformation in the domain of science. Finally, we discuss the\
  \ psychology of conspiracy theories, and address the potential solution of moralizing\
  \ the values of evidence-based and logical thinking.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:00  Intro\
