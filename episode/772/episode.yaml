shownotes: "RECORDED ON APRIL 5th 2023.  \nDr. Joseph Uscinski is Professor of Political\
  \ Science at the University of Miami. He studies public opinion and mass media,\
  \ with a focus on conspiracy theories and related misinformation. He is co-author\
  \ of American Conspiracy Theories (Oxford, 2014) and editor of Conspiracy Theories\
  \ and the People Who Believe Them (Oxford, 2018). His textbook on conspiracy theories\
  \ is Conspiracy Theories: A Primer.\n\nIn this episode, we talk about the politics\
  \ and psychology of conspiracy thinking. We talk about the role of political extremism\
  \ and partisanship in conspiracy thinking, and how conspiracy theories can be associated\
  \ with anti-democratic impulses. We discuss partisan and ideological identities\
  \ versus anti-establishment orientations. We talk about how beliefs about the 2020\
  \ election fraud conspiracy theory changed over time. We discuss if exposure to\
  \ conspiracy theories has any causal power over belief, and if we know how conspiracy\
  \ theories develop and spread. We also discuss if there are more conspiracy theories\
  \ today, and the relationship between conspiracy theory beliefs and vaccine hesitancy.\
  \ Finally, we talk about how worried we should be about conspiracy theories and\
  \ misinformation.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:44</time>\
