His latest book is Free Agents: How Evolution Gave Us Free Will.\n\nIn this episode, we focus on Free Agents. We start by discussing how scientists approach free will, and if we should define free will. We go through some of the major steps in the evolution of free will, and talk about the origins of life on Earth; informational causation; the purpose of life; meaning and value; the evolution of decision making; agency; the evolution of nervous systems; the neocortex; and self-awareness. We talk about how we simulate different courses of action, and how we should understand decision making as a process. We discuss indeterminacy in Physics and Neuroscience. We talk about the Libet experiments, and studies of brain legions. We discuss personality traits and other psychological predispositions. We talk about constraints and top-down causation. Finally, we discuss the link between free will and moral responsibility.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:35</time> How scientists approach free will  \n<time>03:36</time> Defining free will  \n<time>08:39</time> The origins of life on Earth  \n<time>13:14</time> Informational causation  \n<time>19:07</time> Does life have purpose?  \n<time>21:21</time> The evolution of decision making  \n<time>25:28</time> Agency  \n<time>29:44</time> The evolution of nervous systems  \n<time>32:57</time> The neocortex, and the decoupling of perception from action  \n<time>38:03</time> Self-awareness  \n<time>40:22</time> Simulating possible courses of action  \n<time>46:16</time> Understanding decision making as a process  \n<time>53:03</time> Indeterminacy in Physics and Neuroscience  \n<time>1:05:24</time> Brain legions  \n<time>1:09:12</time> Personality traits and other psychological predispositions  \n<time>1:20:55</time> Constraints and top-down causation  \n<time>1:26:04</time> Free will and moral responsibility  \n<time>1:32:23</time> Follow Dr. Mitchell’s work!\n\n---\n\nFollow Dr. Mitchell’s work:  \nOur first interview: https://youtu.be/VBc9Ava4Dgg  \nOur second interview: https://youtu.be/6Ugbm6HJko4  \nFaculty page: http://bit.ly/32qe0rS  \nPersonal website: http://bit.ly/33Bpuc7  \nFree Agents: https://bit.ly/3GX0TEZ  \nWiring the Brain (blog): http://bit.ly/2MKhzCA  \nResearchGate profile: http://bit.ly/2LVNCBJ  \nTwitter handle: @WiringTheBrain\n",
