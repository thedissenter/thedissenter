shownotes: "RECORDED ON JULY 24th 2023.  \nDr. Owen Flanagan is James B. Duke Distinguished\
  \ Professor Emeritus of Philosophy at Duke University. His work is in philosophy\
  \ of mind and psychiatry, ethics, moral psychology, and cross-cultural philosophy.\
  \ He is co-author of Against Happiness.\n\nThis is our second interview. You can\
  \ watch the first one, on The Geography of Morals, here: https://youtu.be/1jEyXTmzdzM\n\
  \nIn this episode, we focus on Against Happiness. We talk about the \u201Chappiness\
  \ agenda\u201D, and what is promoted by advocates of happiness as the ultimate goal.\
  \ We discuss if this agenda is hedonist and utilitarian. We talk about some philosophical\
  \ issues, and criticisms of positive psychology. We discuss what \u201Chappiness\u201D\
  \ means, and issues with how it is measured. We talk about different hierarchies\
  \ of values across cultures. We discuss problems with averaging subjective satisfaction\
  \ scores and comparing countries, and how norms can influence how people answer\
  \ surveys. We talk about some of the politics of this, and question if promoting\
  \ happiness is a political virtue, if disadvantaged people want it, and the example\
  \ of feminism in China. Finally, we discuss what cross-cultural work teaches us\
  \ about norms and individual differences.\n\n\nTime Links:  \n00:00 Intro  \n00:46\
