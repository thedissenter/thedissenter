shownotes: "------------------Sup  \nRECORDED ON SEPTEMBER 28th 2020.  \nDr. Kristina\
  \ Durante is an associate professor of marketing, Marketing Department Vice Chair,\
  \ and the marketing Ph.D. program coordinator at Rutgers Business School. She is\
  \ a social psychologist interested in the biology of decision-making. Her research\
  \ lies at the intersection of social psychology, evolutionary biology, and consumer\
  \ decision-making. Dr. Durante\u2019s research program focuses on how our evolved\
  \ biology (ancestral ecology and internal physiological systems) and our modern\
  \ social environment interact to influence behavior. Her areas of expertise include\
  \ women\u2019s consumer choice and luxury spending, family consumer decisions, hormones\
  \ and behavior, and the psychological consequences of ambiguity.\n\nIn this episode,\
  \ we focus on ovulation, and women\u2019s mate preferences and consumer behavior.\
  \ We discuss how female intrasexual competition changes across the ovulatory cycle,\
  \ and how that manifests in terms of consumer choices and health-related risky behavior.\
  \ We talk about how we should think about the relationship between our evolved psychology\
  \ and the modern conditions we live in. We refer to what happens to women\u2019\
  s consumer patterns in a situation of economic decline. In the final part of our\
  \ talk, we discuss how women can improve their mate preferences, to be more in line\
  \ with modern conditions, and also how they might improve their current relationships.\n\
