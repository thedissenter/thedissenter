  \ Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL), and a Fellow at Harvard\u2019s Berkman Klein\

  \ misinformation, and data visualizations. We start with data visualizations, and\
  \ talk specifically about their impact on how information was conveyed during the\
  \ covid-19 pandemic. We then discuss online misinformation. Finally, we talk about\
  \ the work Crystal is doing on developing data visualizations for people with disabilities,\
  \ like for example blind people.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n\
