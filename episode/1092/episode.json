He is the author of Stories of Love from Vikings to Tinder: The Evolution of Modern Mating Ideologies, Dating Dysfunction, and Demographic Collapse.\n\nIn this episode, we focus on Stories of Love from Vikings to Tinder. We start by discussing the premise of the book, and talk about ideologies of love, human mating systems, the evolution of romantic love, and the methodology of literary analysis. We go through heroic love, the First Sexual Revolution, courtly love, the Second Sexual Revolution, libertine love, confluent love and the Third Sexual Revolution, and marriage patterns across history. We talk about issues with modern mating, namely singledom, sexual inactivity, and dropping fertility rates. We also talk about incels, insings, and the social consequences of high rates of bachelors. Finally, we discuss the potential Fourth Sexual Revolution, and solutions to modern mating problems.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:30</time> The premise of the book  \n<time>01:24</time> Ideologies of love  \n<time>02:28</time> Mating systems  \n<time>05:52</time> Literary analysis  \n<time>15:34</time> Heroic love  \n<time>23:19</time> First Sexual Revolution  \n<time>25:37</time> Courtly love  \n<time>30:24</time> Are incels a modern phenomenon?  \n<time>34:31</time> Second Sexual Revolution  \n<time>38:40</time> Libertine love  \n<time>41:35</time> 1968, confluent love, and the Third Sexual Revolution  \n<time>49:49</time> Marriage patterns across history  \n<time>54:50</time> Modern mating: singledom, sexual inactivity, and dropping fertility rates  \n<time>1:12:16</time> Incels, insings, and high rates of bachelors  \n<time>1:17:16</time> The potential Fourth Sexual Revolution  \n<time>1:21:54</time> Solutions  \n<time>1:29:11</time> Follow Dr. Larsen\u2019s work!\n\n---\n\nFollow Dr. Larsen\u2019s work:  \nResearchGate profile: https://tinyurl.com/2hdres7r  \nStories of Love from Vikings to Tinder: https://tinyurl.com/4pkcxwjn\n",
