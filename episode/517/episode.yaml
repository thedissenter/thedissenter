  \ the Highlands Biological Station and Professor of Evolutionary Biology at Western\
  \ Carolina University, where he has taught courses in genetics, entomology, evolution,\
  \ and biogeography since 1996. His many interests include insect behavior and ecology,\
  \ environmental history and philosophy, conservation biology, and the history of\
  \ science. His research has focused in recent years on Charles Darwin, Alfred Russel\
  \ Wallace, and the history of evolutionary thought. He has authored numerous research\
  \ papers, reviews, magazine articles, and 7 books, including Darwin's Backyard:\

  \ for the American Association for the Advancement of Science/Subaru Prize \u2014\
  \ and the co-edited volume An Alfred Russel Wallace Companion (Chicago, 2019).\n\
  \nIn this episode, we talk about Darwin, Wallace, On the Origin of Species, and\
  \ The Descent of Man. We first talk about On the Origin of Species, where Darwin\u2019\
  s ideas came from, and in what ways they differ from Wallace\u2019s. We then get\
  \ into The Descent of Man, and go through some of the most important topics covered\
  \ there, including sexual selection, our primate origins, the evolutionary origins\
  \ of our mental faculties, race and sex differences, cultural evolution, and (cultural)\
  \ group selection. We also talk about how Darwin was a precursor of evolutionary\
  \ psychology. We discuss the eusocial insects, and if their behavior is best understood\
  \ as the result of inclusive fitness/kin selection or group selection. Finally,\
  \ we give a summary of some of the most important things Darwin got right and wrong.\n\
