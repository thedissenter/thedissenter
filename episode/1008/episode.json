	"shownotes": "RECORDED ON MAY 1st 2024.  \nDr. Paul Smaldino is an Associate Professor of Cognitive & Information Sciences and faculty in the Quantitative and Systems Biology graduate program at the University of California Merced, where he is also affiliated with the Center for Analytic Political Engagement and the Center for Interdisciplinary Neuroscience. Extramurally, he is an External Professor at the Santa Fe Institute. He studies how behaviors emerge and evolve in response to social, cultural, and ecological pressures, as well as how those pressures can themselves evolve. He is the author of Modeling Social Behavior: Mathematical and Agent-Based Models of Social Dynamics and Cultural Evolution.\n\nIn this episode, we focus on Modeling Social Behavior. We talk about modeling in science, the theoretical foundations of social science, mathematical models and agent-based models, and fine-grained and coarse-grained models. We discuss assumptions about human psychology, and we then explore examples of social dynamics that can be modeled, like contagion and the spread of innovation; opinion dynamics, and consensus and polarization; cooperation; norms; and science as a social phenomenon. Finally, we discuss how to turn ideas into models, and the limitations of models.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:41</time> What is modeling in science?  \n<time>07:44</time> Theoretical foundations in the social sciences  \n<time>14:00</time> Mathematical models and agent-based models  \n<time>19:04</time> Fine-grained and coarse-grained models  \n<time>23:17</time> Assumptions about human psychology  \n<time>27:07</time> Contagion, and the spread of innovation  \n<time>36:37</time> How people change opinions  \n<time>46:19</time> Consensus and polarization  \n<time>50:27</time> Cooperation  \n<time>1:00:50</time> What are norms?  \n<time>1:08:21</time> Science as a social phenomenon  \n<time>1:20:15</time> How to turn ideas into models  \n<time>1:28:28</time> The limitations of models  \n<time>1:33:28</time> Follow Dr. Smaldino\u2019s work!\n\n---\n\nFollow Dr. Smaldino\u2019s work:  \nFaculty page: http://tinyurl.com/79b5senm  \nWebsite: http://tinyurl.com/sa9797nu  \nResearchGate profile: http://tinyurl.com/yr5zprr2  \nModeling Social Behavior: http://tinyurl.com/4cvtr5mp\n",
