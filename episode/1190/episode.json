	"shownotes": "RECORDED ON SEPTEMBER 19th 2025.  \nDr. Eric Storm is Associate Professor of History at Leiden University. He is a specialist in Spanish history of the 19th and 20th centuries. He also conducted extensive research into the construction of regional identities in France, Spain and Germany between 1890 and 1940. At present, he mainly publishes about nationalization processes in a comparative perspective. He is the author of Nationalism: A World History.\n\nIn this episode, we focus on Nationalism. We start by talking about when nationalism and nation-states started, and how they evolved over time. We discuss nationalist radicalization occurred from 1885 to 1914, World War I, the interwar period, the impact of World War II, and the modernization of nation-states and the dissolution of modern empires. We talk about the impact of nationalism on culture, and vice-versa. We discuss exceptions to the nation-state model (Saudi Arabia, Brunei, the Vatican City, and Afghanistan), and nations without states (the Kurds, and the Catalans). Finally, we talk about the current rise of nationalism, xenophobic incidents, and being against the entry of poor immigrants.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:25</time> When did nationalism start?  \n<time>10:12</time> How nation-states evolved over time  \n<time>19:28</time> Nationalist radicalization occurred from 1885 to 1914, and World War I  \n<time>25:34</time> The interwar period, and the impact of World War II  \n<time>28:41</time> The modernization of nation-states and the dissolution of modern empires  \n<time>39:25</time> The impact of nationalism on culture, and vice-versa  \n<time>47:36</time> Exceptions to the nation-state model: Saudi Arabia, Brunei, the Vatican City, and Afghanistan  \n<time>49:55</time> Nations without states: the Kurds, and the Catalans  \n<time>52:44</time> The current rise of nationalism, xenophobic incidents, and being against the entry of poor immigrants  \n<time>1:02:44</time> Follow Dr. Storm\u2019s work!\n\n---\n\nFollow Dr. Storm\u2019s work:  \nFaculty page: https://tinyurl.com/3j6yzbfn  \nNationalism: https://tinyurl.com/54fc6s87\n",
