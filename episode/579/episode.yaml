  \ Healthcare Executive Director of the Institute for Health Innovation and Vice\
  \ President for Health Innovation at Northern Kentucky University. Dr. Hardcastle\
  \ specializes in philosophy of neuroscience/biology, philosophy of cognitive science,\
  \ philosophy of psychology, and philosophical implications of psychiatry. She researches\

  \ and philosophy of mind. She teaches metaphysics, science studies, feminist philosophy\
  \ of science. She is the author of several books, including Locating Consciousness,\
  \ The Myth of Pain, and Constructing the Self.\n\nIn this episode, we talk about\
  \ the self, consciousness, pain, and psychiatry. We discuss what the self is and\
  \ how people construct it. We talk about consciousness, its causal relationship\
  \ to other aspects of the mind, and how to better study it. We talk about how pain\
  \ is complex process. We ask if it is possible to distinguish between normal and\
  \ abnormal psychological conditions, and what we can learn about by mind by studying\
  \ conditions where it goes awry. Finally, we discuss the relationship between neuroscience,\
  \ cognitive science, psychology, and psychiatry, and the role philosophers play\
  \ in these fields.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:42</time>\
