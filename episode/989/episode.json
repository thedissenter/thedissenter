	"published": "2024-09-05",
	"shownotes": "RECORDED ON MARCH 13th 2024.  \nDr. Robert Vinten is a postdoctoral research fellow within a project on epistemic injustice and previously a postdoctoral research fellow within a project on the epistemology of religious belief at the NOVA University of Lisbon. He is the author of Wittgenstein and the Social Sciences (2020) and of numerous journal articles about Wittgenstein\u2019s philosophy. He is also the editor of Wittgenstein and the Cognitive Science of Religion: Interpreting Human Nature and the Mind.\n\nIn this episode, we focus on Wittgenstein and the Cognitive Science of Religion. We first discuss Wittgenstein\u2019s ideas about religion, the cognitive science of religion, and critiques of it by Wittgensiteinians. We discuss whether religion is a natural phenomenon, and issues regarding reductionism, scientism, and the cognitive science of religion as a reaction to cultural relativism. We talk about Dr. Vinten\u2019s criticisms of Pascal Boyer\u2019s approach to religion, and theory of mind. Finally, we talk about a new project on epistemic injustice that Dr. Vinten is involved in.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:46</time> Wittgenstein and religion  \n<time>05:01</time> The cognitive science of religion  \n<time>06:42</time> Why Wittgenstein?  \n<time>18:25</time> Critiques of cognitive science of religion by Wittgensteinians  \n<time>23:20</time> Is religion a natural phenomenon?  \n<time>30:15</time> Reductionism  \n<time>33:39</time> Scientism  \n<time>39:38</time> Cultural relativism  \n<time>47:50</time> Pascal Boyer\u2019s approach to religion  \n<time>57:48</time> Theory of mind  \n<time>1:01:04</time> Epistemic injustice  \n<time>1:11:20</time> Follow Dr. Vinten\u2019s work!\n\n---\n\nFollow Dr. Vinten\u2019s work:  \nUniversity page: https://bit.ly/3MPFrVa  \nPhilPeople profile: https://bit.ly/46nU6Oz  \nWittgenstein and the Cognitive Science of Religion: https://bit.ly/3MRu5QJ\n",
