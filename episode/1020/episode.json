	"shownotes": "RECORDED ON MAY 31st 2024.  \nDr. Cara Ocobock is Associate Professor and Director of the Human Energetics Laboratory at the University of Notre Dame. Her research program integrates human biology and anthropology, with a focus on the interaction between anatomy, physiology, evolution, and the environment. She explores the physiological and behavioral mechanisms necessary to cope with and adapt to extreme climate and physical activity. Dr. Ocobock\u2019s research is at the intersection of metabolic physiology, evolution, culture, and behavior.\n\nIn this episode, we first talk about human energetics, how people adapt to extreme environments, the case of the reindeer herders from Finland, the role of the adipose tissue in metabolism, issues with BMI measurements, and sex differences in human energetics. We then explore the debate in anthropology about hunting, and whether women also participated in it, and we discuss \u201cMan the Hunter\u201d, evidence for women hunting, and the sexual division of labor. Finally, we talk about Drs. Ocobock and Roseman\u2019s Scientific American article, \u201cTo Understand Sex, We Need to Ask the Right Questions\u201d.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:33</time> Human energetics  \n<time>02:11</time> Extreme environments and climate change  \n<time>10:08</time> The reindeer herders from Finland  \n<time>15:20</time> Adipose tissue and metabolism  \n<time>24:24</time> Issues with BMI measurements  \n<time>31:52</time> Sex differences in human energetics  \n<time>36:55</time> \u201cMan the Hunter\u201d  \n<time>47:55</time> Do women also hunt?  \n<time>1:38:57</time> Sexual division of labor  \n<time>1:53:59</time> To Understand Sex, We Need to Ask the Right Questions  \n<time>2:12:10</time> Follow Dr. Ocobock\u2019s work!\n\n---\n\nFollow Dr. Ocobock\u2019s work:  \nFaculty page: https://bit.ly/3U05EVr  \nResearchGate profile: http://tinyurl.com/8fbu8nxz  \nTwitter handle: @CaraOcobock\n",
