  \ How do people resolve the ambivalent feelings they have about members of other\
  \ groups? What mental maneuvers do people use to shield themselves from threats\
  \ to their self-concepts? How do people deal with having violated their moral and\
  \ other behavioral standards? At the broadest level, Dr. Newman\u2019s research\
  \ focuses on the motivational aspects of social cognition. More specific interests\
  \ include dehumanization, social stigma, defensive and self-protective processes\
  \ in judgment and memory, and the social psychology of genocide and mass killing."

shownotes: "RECORDED ON FEBRUARY 4th 2022.  \nDr. Leonard Newman is Associate Professor\
  \ of Psychology at Syracuse University. How do people resolve the ambivalent feelings\
  \ they have about members of other groups? What mental maneuvers do people use to\
  \ shield themselves from threats to their self-concepts? How do people deal with\
  \ having violated their moral and other behavioral standards? At the broadest level,\
  \ Dr. Newman\u2019s research focuses on the motivational aspects of social cognition.\
  \ More specific interests include dehumanization, social stigma, defensive and self-protective\
  \ processes in judgment and memory, and the social psychology of genocide and mass\
  \ killing.\n\nIn this episode, we talk about issues in social psychology. We talk\
  \ about the self-concept, and how people deal with threats to it. We discuss how\
  \ people react to their own violations of moral standards. We talk about dispositional,\
  \ situational, and interactionist explanations of wrongdoing, and cross-cultural\
  \ variation in people\u2019s attitudes toward them. We explore attitudinal ambivalence\
  \ and pluralistic ignorance. Finally, we talk about how preferred beliefs influence\
  \ skepticism about psychological findings.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time>\
