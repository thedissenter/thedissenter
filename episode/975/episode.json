	"title": "#975 Gregory Retallack: Paleopedology, and the Link Between Life and the Soil",
	"published": "2024-08-02",
	"shownotes": "Dr. Gregory Retallack is Professor Emeritus in the Department of Earth Sciences at the University of Oregon. His research has examined the fossil record of soils through major events in Earth history, extending back some 4.6 billion years. He is the author of books like \u201cSoils of the past: an introduction to paleopedology\u201d, and \u201cSoil grown tall: the epic saga of life from earth\u201d.\n\nIn this episode, we talk about paleopedology. We start by talking about what it is, how we analyze fossil soils, what information we can get from them, and the factors that play a role in soil formation. We discuss the coevolution of life and earth, the study of the soils of barren planets, the biosignatures of life that we can find geologically, and the evolution of plants. We also talk about studying climate change over the course of Earth\u2019s history through the soil, and what we can learn about paleoenvironments. Finally, we discuss the effects of soil on the taste of wine and other aspects of agriculture.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:43</time> What is paleopedology?  \n<time>02:51</time> How do we analyze fossil soils, and what information can we get from them?  \n<time>05:44</time> The factors that play a role in soil formation  \n<time>07:37</time> How life coevolved with earth  \n<time>11:20</time> Studying the soils of barren planets  \n<time>19:23</time> What biosignatures of life on earth can we find geologically?  \n<time>22:21</time> The evolution of plants  \n<time>24:24</time> Studying climate change over the course of Earth\u2019s history through the soil  \n<time>28:18</time> Learning about paleoenvironments  \n<time>32:35</time> The effects of soil on the taste of wine  \n<time>41:52</time> Follow Dr. Retallack\u2019s work!\n\n---\n\nFollow Dr. Retallack\u2019s work:  \nUniversity page: https://bit.ly/3I0tb2B  \nResearchGate profile: https://bit.ly/3YKtF2N  \nBooks on Amazon: https://bit.ly/3YPRXIA\n",
