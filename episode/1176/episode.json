We discuss what a sexual fantasy is, what a paraphilia is, and what the most common sexual fantasies are. We talk about what influences them, including the influence of pornography. We discuss differences between men and women, and differences between democrats and republicans. We also discuss who people fantasize about, whether all sexual fantasies are \u201cnormal\u201d, what happens when people share their sexual fantasies with their partners, and whether people act on their sexual fantasies. Finally, we talk about when people need to manage their sexual desires, and how many sexual partners most people have had.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:35</time> What is a sexual fantasy?  \n<time>03:07</time> What is a paraphilia?  \n<time>06:20</time> The most common sexual fantasies  \n<time>12:18</time> What influences sexual fantasies?  \n<time>17:56</time> Differences between men and women  \n<time>22:23</time> Differences between democrats and republicans  \n<time>27:26</time> What do one\u2019s sexual fantasies say about oneself?  \n<time>30:02</time> Who do people fantasize about?  \n<time>31:56</time> Are all sexual fantasies \u201cnormal\u201d?  \n<time>34:28</time> When people share their fantasies  \n<time>39:17</time> Do people act on their fantasies?  \n<time>45:04</time> When do people need to manage their sexual desires?  \n<time>46:53</time> How many sexual partners have most people had?  \n<time>53:57</time> Follow Dr. Lehmiller\u2019s work!\n\n---\n\nFollow Dr. Lehmiller\u2019s work:  \nWebsite: https://www.sexandpsychology.com/  \nResearchGate profile: https://tinyurl.com/y5bmte6w  \nTell Me What You Want: https://tinyurl.com/3a653w4p\n",
