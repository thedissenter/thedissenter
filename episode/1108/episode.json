We talk about the orgasm gap between men and women, cultural influences, how porn can influence it, the importance of sex education, and the importance of foreplay and communication during sex. We discuss whether penis size matters, the different ways women can achieve orgasm, how men and women feel about hookup sex, and the evolutionary origins of the female orgasm. Finally, we talk about what women can do to improve their own pleasure, and what men can do to improve the sexual experiences of their partners.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:33</time> The premise of the book  \n<time>03:01</time> The orgasm gap  \n<time>07:11</time> What influence does porn have?  \n<time>10:56</time> The traits of sexual partners  \n<time>12:44</time> Sex education  \n<time>15:00</time> The importance of foreplay and communication  \n<time>19:54</time> Does penis size matter?  \n<time>21:53</time> The different ways women can achieve orgasm  \n<time>24:12</time> Hookup sex  \n<time>25:35</time> The evolution of the female orgasm  \n<time>30:02</time> What can women do to improve their own pleasure?  \n<time>31:37</time> What can men do to improve the sexual experiences of their partners?  \n<time>33:30</time> Follow Dr. Mintz\u2019s work!\n\n---\n\nFollow Dr. Mintz\u2019s work:  \nFaculty page: https://tinyurl.com/42y5xhwb  \nWebsite: https://www.drlauriemintz.com/  \nBecoming Cliterate: https://tinyurl.com/6mwhetek\n",
