	"shownotes": "RECORDED ON MARCH 8th 2024.  \nDr. Sofia Forss is Ambizione Group Leader in the Department of Evolutionary Biology and Environmental Studies at the University of Zurich. Her research interests include animal behavior, comparative cognition, behavioral ecology, animal curiosity and innovativeness, social learning in animals, the captivity effect on animal cognition, developmental influences on cognitive development, and the effects of urbanization on animal behavior. Her research focuses on what makes animals explorative and creative and thereby increase their cognitive potential. In doing so, she studies the development of intelligence and how variation during ontogeny influence curiosity and thereupon following cognitive processes and skill learning.\n\nIn this episode, we first talk about neophobia and apes, how they react to novel objects and foods, and differences between wild and captive apes. We then discuss the social information hypothesis; curiosity, and how it is shaped by ecology and sociality; the cultural intelligence hypothesis; and social learning and asocial learning. We also talk about the study of intelligence and cognitive performance in orangutans. Finally, we discuss creativity from an evolutionary perspective, and the conditions that facilitate it.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:59</time> Neophobia in apes  \n<time>11:49</time> Differences between wild and captive apes  \n<time>16:26</time> Experimenting novel foods  \n<time>17:54</time> The social information hypothesis  \n<time>21:55</time> Curiosity, and how it\u2019s shaped by ecology and sociality  \n<time>26:54</time> The cultural intelligence hypothesis  \n<time>29:45</time> Social learning and asocial learning  \n<time>31:58</time> Studying cognitive performance in orangutans  \n<time>33:32</time> Intelligence  \n<time>45:40</time> Creativity, and what facilitates it  \n<time>54:47</time> Follow Dr. Forss\u2019 work!\n\n---\n\nFollow Dr. Forss\u2019 work:  \nUniversity page: https://bit.ly/47zMNnI  \nWebsite: https://bit.ly/47FG1Nq  \nResearchGate profile: https://bit.ly/3MLjTcb  \nTwitter handle: @ForssSofia\n",
