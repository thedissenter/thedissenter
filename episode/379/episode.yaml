  \ episode, we talk about close relationships, and the interrelation between relationship\
  \ science and evolutionary psychology. Topics include pair-bonding; short-term and\
  \ long-term relationships; what we can learn from speed-dating studies; the Relationship\
  \ Coordination and Strategic Timing (ReCAST) Model; and what males relationships\
  \ last, and if people are good at predicting how romantic breakups will affect them\
  \ emotionally.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:56  Pair-bonding  \n02:28  Studying short-term\
