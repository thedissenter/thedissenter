She is the author of Marx\u2019s Ethical Vision.\n\nIn this episode, we focus on Marx\u2019s Ethical Vision. We start by discussing Marxism and morality, and whether morality is a form of ideology. We talk about human nature, normativity, and the \u201crich individual\u201d. We discuss \u201cbourgeois\u201d ethics, individuality, and human rights. We talk about the idea of abolishing morality, and how life would be like in a fully developed communist society. We also talk about the failures of neoliberal capitalism, the role of intellectuals, and intersectionality.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:26</time> Marxism and morality  \n<time>04:20</time> Is morality a form of ideology?  \n<time>08:19</time> Human nature, normativity, and the \u201crich individual\u201d  \n<time>18:40</time> \u201cBourgeois\u201d ethics  \n<time>24:39</time> Individuality  \n<time>30:43</time> Human rights  \n<time>35:42</time> Abolishing morality  \n<time>45:12</time> Life in a fully developed communist society  \n<time>50:20</time> The failures of neoliberal capitalism  \n<time>54:10</time> The role of intellectuals  \n<time>58:34</time> Intersectionality  \n<time>1:04:24</time> Follow Dr. Wills\u2019 work!\n\n---\n\nFollow Dr. Wills\u2019 work:  \nFaculty page: https://tinyurl.com/3jy84pen  \nWebsite: https://www.vanessawills.com/  \nMarx\u2019s Ethical Vision: https://tinyurl.com/mr3jasss  \nX handle: @vcwills\n",
