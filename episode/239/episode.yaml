  \ and Applied Evolutionary Anthropology and Demography.\n\nIn this episode, we talk\
  \ about several aspects of human sociality from a human behavioral ecology perspective.\
  \ We first discuss alloparenting, and the role of fathers. We talk about what we\
  \ can learn about human nature from traditional societies. We then get into studies\
  \ Dr. Page did with the Agta, a population of Filipino hunter-gatherers, and particularly\
  \ what happens when some of their groups adopt a more sedentary agriculture-based\
  \ lifestyle, particularly in terms of health, fertility and demography. Finally,\
  \ we talk about how we can use this knowledge to help isolated hunter-gatherer tribes\
  \ to thrive. \n\nTime Links:  \n<time>01:05</time> Alloparenting in human societies\
