	"shownotes": "RECORDED ON MARCH 12th 2024.  \nDr. Tuomas Tahko is Professor of Metaphysics of Science at the University of Bristol. He specializes in contemporary analytic metaphysics, with an emphasis on methodological and epistemic issues: \u201cmeta-metaphysics\u201d. He also works at the interface of metaphysics and philosophy of science: \u201cmetaphysics of science\u201d. Broader research interests include issues in epistemology, philosophical logic, philosophy of science, philosophy of mind, and history of philosophy. He was the PI of an ERC Consolidator Project \"The Metaphysical Unity of Science\" (MetaScience, 2018-2023).\n\nIn this episode, we talk about meta-metaphysics. We first discuss what it is, and how it relates to metaphysics. We talk about the differences between metaphysics and ontology, the different ways of conceptualizing reality, what mind-independence means, and realist and anti-realist positions in meta-metaphysics. We then go through concepts in meta-metaphysics like substances and properties; substance ontology and process ontology; a \u201cfirst philosophy\u201d; minimal truthmakers; natural kinds; fundamentality; foundationalism; essence, ground, and modality; and structure. Finally, we discuss whether there are any building blocks to reality.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:36</time> Meta-metaphysics  \n<time>07:57</time> The difference between metaphysics and ontology  \n<time>10:02</time> Different ways of conceptualizing reality  \n<time>13:38</time> What does mind-independence mean?  \n<time>20:38</time> Realist and anti-realist positions in metaphysics  \n<time>26:13</time> Are colors real?  \n<time>35:08</time> Substances and properties  \n<time>38:22</time> Substance ontology and process ontology  \n<time>43:21</time> What is a \u201cfirst philosophy\u201d?  \n<time>45:50</time> Minimal truthmakers  \n<time>49:48</time> Natural kinds  \n<time>54:55</time> Fundamentality  \n<time>1:01:57</time> A foundationalist approach to reality, and coherentism  \n<time>1:06:03</time> Essence, ground, and modality  \n<time>1:21:11</time> Structure  \n<time>1:22:45</time> Are there no building blocks to reality?  \n<time>1:32:38</time> Follow Dr. Tahko\u2019s work!\n\n---\n\nFollow Dr. Tahko\u2019s work:  \nFaculty page: https://bit.ly/3G2G22d  \nWebsite: https://bit.ly/3sF9mIS  \nPhilPeople profile: https://bit.ly/3MR5IlZ  \nTwitter handle: @ttahko\n",
