	"shownotes": "RECORDED ON APRIL 21st 2025.  \nDr. Stephen Morris is Associate Professor of Philosophy at The College of Staten Island/CUNY.  His research interests include ethical theory, applied ethics, free will, and moral psychology. He is the author of Moral Damages: The Case for Abolishing Morality.\n\nIn this episode, we focus on Moral Damages. We discuss how people usually think about morality. We talk about moral abolitionism, the main theoretical and empirical arguments against the existence of objective moral truths, retributivist moral anti-realism, and constructivism. We discuss the role of morality in violence, how morality influences politics, and how it contributes to individual well-being. We talk about alternatives to moral abolitionism. We also discuss whether societies need morality to function well; the roles of empathy, prudential self-interest, and reason in replacing morality; why scientists think we need morality; and how morality is ill-suited to help us deal with today\u2019s greatest challenges. Finally, we discuss whether it is possible to abolish morality.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:30</time> How people think about morality  \n<time>03:36</time> Moral abolitionism  \n<time>10:01</time> Arguments against the existence of objective moral truths  \n<time>18:49</time> Retributivist moral anti-realism  \n<time>23:22</time> Constructivism  \n<time>30:39</time> The role of morality in violence  \n<time>41:00</time> How morality influences politics  \n<time>55:50</time> Individual well-being  \n<time>1:04:23</time> Alternatives to moral abolitionism  \n<time>1:16:34</time> Do human societies need morality to function well?  \n<time>1:24:37</time> Empathy, prudential self-interest, and reason  \n<time>1:31:47</time> Why do scientists think we need morality?  \n<time>1:36:22</time> Today\u2019s greatest challenges  \n<time>1:41:08</time> Is it possible to abolish morality?  \n<time>1:47:31</time> Follow Dr. Morris\u2019 work!\n\n---\n\nFollow Dr. Morris\u2019 work:  \nFaculty page: https://tinyurl.com/muf335he  \nWebsite: https://stephengeorgemorris.com/  \nPhilPeople profile: https://tinyurl.com/ypud7aer  \nMoral Damages: https://tinyurl.com/mr2uttah\n",
