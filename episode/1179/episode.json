	"shownotes": "RECORDED ON AUGUST 19th 2025.  \nDr. Jaap de Roode is Samuel C. Dobbs Professor in the Department of Biology at Emory University. He studies the ecology and evolution of parasites and their hosts, and is interested in co-infections of different parasite species, self-medication in hosts, and local coevolution of hosts and parasites. One of his main interests is the evolution of parasite virulence (i.e. parasite-induced reductions of host fitness). He is the author of Doctors by Nature: How Ants, Apes, and Other Animals Heal Themselves.\n\nIn this episode, we focus on Doctors by Nature. We talk about four different ways that animals use natural products to fight infections and alleviate disease: prophylaxis; therapeutic medication; body anointing; and fumigation. We discuss whether animals know that they are medicating themselves, and whether these behaviors are learned or innate. We go through examples of monarch butterflies, apes that swallow leaves to dislodge worms, how bees combat pathogens, social distancing, nausea and neophobia, and why dogs eat grass. We discuss when humans started using medication, and how we can benefit from studying the medicating behaviors of animals. Finally, we talk about applications of this knowledge.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:30</time> The premise of the book  \n<time>03:39</time> Prophylaxis, therapeutic medication, body anointing, and fumigation  \n<time>17:41</time> Do animals know that they are medicating themselves?  \n<time>20:00</time> Are these behaviors learned or innate?  \n<time>22:41</time> Monarch butterflies  \n<time>25:41</time> Apes that swallow leaves to dislodge worms  \n<time>29:02</time> How bees combat pathogens  \n<time>33:52</time> Social distancing  \n<time>39:35</time> Nausea and neophobia  \n<time>42:44</time> Why do dogs eat grass?  \n<time>45:19</time> When did humans start using medication?  \n<time>47:54</time> How can we benefit from studying the medicating behaviors of animals?  \n<time>50:22</time> Applications  \n<time>54:57</time> Follow Dr. de Roode\u2019s work!\n\n---\n\nFollow Dr. de Roode\u2019s work:  \nFaculty page: https://tinyurl.com/4774z5rp  \nGoogle Scholar page: https://tinyurl.com/y2s4jzm9  \nDoctors by Nature: https://tinyurl.com/nhbdydkc\n",
