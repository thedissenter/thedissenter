She is the author of Technology Is Not Neutral: A Short Guide to Technology Ethics.\n\nIn this episode, we focus on Technology Is Not Neutral. We start by talking about technology ethics, and we discuss arguments for and against technology being neutral. We discuss what is a tool, and if scientific discoveries are value-free. We talk about design bias, and the example of policing. We discuss the problem with sci-fi fiction, existential risks, and distracting from real threats. We talk about social media, clickbait, misinformation, online privacy, data collection, and regulation. Finally, we discuss digital health tools used during the COVID-19 pandemic, and if they were worth it.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:30</time> Technology ethics  \n<time>06:24</time> Is technology neutral?  \n<time>15:30</time> What is a tool?  \n<time>32:55</time> Are scientific discoveries value-free?  \n<time>39:17</time> Design bias, and the example of policing  \n<time>52:01</time> The problem with sci-fi fiction, existential risks, and distracting from real problems  \n<time>1:05:27</time> Social media, clickbait, and misinformation  \n<time>1:11:40</time> Online privacy, data collection, and regulation  \n<time>1:22:53</time> Digital health tools for the COVID-19 pandemic  \n<time>1:36:30</time> Follow Dr. Hare’s work!\n\n---\n\nFollow Dr. Hare’s work:  \nWebsite: http://bit.ly/3lE48JV  \nTechnology Is Not Neutral: https://bit.ly/3K0csgj  \nTwitter handle: @hare_brain\n",
