shownotes: "RECORDED ON APRIL 13th 2023.  \nDr. Gareth Leng was one of the founders\
  \ in 1983 of the British Society for Neuroendocrinology. He was appointed as the\
  \ Chair of Experimental Physiology at the University of Edinburgh in 1994, after\
  \ 17 years at what is now the Babraham Institute, Cambridge. He is a former Editor-in-Chief\
  \ of the Journal of Neuroendocrinology, and a former President of the International\
  \ Neuroendocrine Federation. He is the author of The Matter of Facts: Skepticism,\
  \ Persuasion, and Evidence in Science.\n\nIn this episode, we focus on The Matter\
  \ of Facts. We talk about what evidence is; structure and norms in science; the\
  \ \u201Cscientific method\u201D; Thomas Kuhn, scientific revolutions, and paradigms.\
  \ We discuss issues with scientific publication and citation. We discuss if science\
  \ is value-free, if it is done by individual geniuses, and if we can communicate\
  \ science through narratives. Finally, we address a question from a patron of the\
  \ show, regarding why people tend to rely more on authority than evidence, and what\
  \ we can do about it.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:43</time>\
