	"shownotes": "Dr. Edward Watts is presently the Vassiliadis Professor of Byzantine Greek History at the University of California, San Diego. His research interests center on the intellectual and religious history of the Roman Empire and the early Byzantine Empire. He is the author of several books on ancient history, including Mortal Republic: How Rome Fell Into Tyranny, and The Eternal Decline and Fall of Rome: The History of a Dangerous Idea. His latest book is The Romans: A 2,000-Year History.\n\nIn this episode, we focus on The Romans. We start by discussing who the Romans were, the origins of the Roman state, the Roman Revolution, the counterrevolution, how the Republic was established, and how Rome expanded. We also talk about the rivalry between Rome and Carthage, the Punic Wars, the formation of the Roman Empire, and the reigns of Caligula, Claudius, Nero, Trajan, and Hadrian. We discuss how Rome was made Christian, what brought about the end of the Roman West, the Byzantines and the empire in the East, the Holy Roman Empire, and medieval Rome. Finally, we talk about how and when the death of the Roman state occurred, and the factors behind the longevity of Rome.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:30</time> Who were the Romans?  \n<time>08:52</time> The origins of Rome  \n<time>13:04</time> The Roman Revolution, the counterrevolution, and how the Republic was established  \n<time>23:30</time> How Rome expanded  \n<time>27:51</time> The rivalry between Rome and Carthage, and the Punic Wars  \n<time>34:49</time> The Roman Empire  \n<time>44:45</time> Caligula, Claudius, and Nero  \n<time>55:51</time> Trajan and Hadrian  \n<time>1:00:38</time> Constantine, and how Rome was made Christian  \n<time>1:06:01</time> What brought about the end of the Roman West?  \n<time>1:11:05</time> Were the Byzantines also Romans?  \n<time>1:13:39</time> The death of Justinian, and the secession of the city of Rome  \n<time>1:25:53</time> The Holy Roman Empire  \n<time>1:28:52</time> How was the medieval Roman state?  \n<time>1:33:32</time> How and when did the death of the Roman state occur?  \n<time>1:41:44</time> The factors behind the longevity of Rome  \n<time>1:46:08</time> Follow Dr. Watts\u2019 work!\n\n---\n\nFollow Dr. Watts\u2019 work:  \nFaculty page: https://bit.ly/2SPNmW5  \nAcademia.edu page: https://bit.ly/3iWFxsd  \nRome's Eternal Decline (YT channel): https://bit.ly/2VBJexu  \nThe Romans: https://tinyurl.com/2j582nx4\n",
