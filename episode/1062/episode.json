She also co-hosts The Overpopulation Podcast, a popular series that delves into the nuances of the drivers and impacts of human expansionism with expert guests.\n\nIn this episode, we start by talking about how we determined whether there is overpopulation or underpopulation. We discuss the factors behind birth rates, whether there is a relationship between childlessness and fertility rates, pronatalism, reproductive rights, environmentalism and climate change, a near-infinite economic growth mentality, and aging populations and social security.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:56</time> Overpopulation  \n<time>06:05</time> Factors behind birth rates  \n<time>09:53</time> Childlessness and fertility rates  \n<time>14:12</time> Pronatalism  \n<time>17:37</time> Reproductive rights  \n<time>23:22</time> Environmentalism and climate change  \n<time>29:05</time> Near-infinite economic growth  \n<time>36:24</time> Aging populations and social security  \n<time>46:44</time> Follow Nandita\u2019s work!\n\n---\n\nFollow Dr. Nandita\u2019s work:  \nFaculty page: https://shorturl.at/iuMCI  \nPopulation Balance: https://shorturl.at/EhWKy  \nLinkedIn profile: https://tinyurl.com/5hy7rnsw\n",
