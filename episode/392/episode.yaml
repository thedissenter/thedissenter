  \ Psychotic Visionaries.\n\nIn this episode, we talk about the psychological effects\
  \ of media, and How Madness Shaped History. We start by talking about a bit of the\
  \ history of how people tend to demonize new technology. We then get into specific\
  \ technologies, like videogames, movies, and series. We address specifically 13\
  \ Reasons Why, and screen time. Finally, we cover come of the main topics of How\
  \ Madness Shaped History, and discuss things like a distinction between madness,\
  \ mental illness, and insanity; how complicated it is to diagnose historical figures;\
  \ if mental health professionals should diagnose politicians; and how someone gets\
  \ mad.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:57  Demonizing new technology  \n05:22  Violent videogames\
