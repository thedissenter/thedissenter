	"shownotes": "Dr. Philip Ball is a freelance science writer, with a BA in Chemistry from the University of Oxford and a PhD in Physics from the University of Bristol. He was an editor at Nature for over 20 years. He is the author of many popular books on science, the latest one being How Life Works: A User\u2019s Guide to the New Biology.\n\nIn this episode, we focus on How Life Works. We start by discussing what life is, the metaphors people use to talk about it, and living things as generators of meaning. We explore the role of genes and how they work, why context matters, the relationship between genes and traits, and genetic transcription and translation. We discuss the role of proteins, and networks of interaction in organisms. We talk about the cell in the context of organisms and in evolution, and how cells replicate and tissues grow. We discuss what agency is. Finally, we talk about the current paradigm in medicine, and how we can redesign life.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:33</time> What is life?  \n<time>09:10</time> Metaphors of life  \n<time>14:25</time> Living things as generators of meaning  \n<time>22:44</time> The role of genes, and how they work  \n<time>30:13</time> Context matters  \n<time>35:40</time> The relationship between genes and traits  \n<time>41:30</time> Genetic transcription and translation  \n<time>47:13</time> The role of proteins  \n<time>52:13</time> Networks of interaction  \n<time>56:03</time> The cell  \n<time>1:01:59</time> Units and levels of selection  \n<time>1:05:58</time> How cells replicate and tissues grow  \n<time>1:15:59</time> Agency  \n<time>1:20:33</time> Implications for medicine  \n<time>1:31:28</time> Redesigning life  \n<time>1:40:56</time> Follow Dr. Ball\u2019s work!\n\n---\n\nFollow Dr. Ball\u2019s work:  \nOur first interview: https://youtu.be/LOft0GnIomE  \nWebsite: https://tinyurl.com/52bfrt63  \nHow Life Works: https://tinyurl.com/yd4t2wf6  \nTwitter handle: @philipcball\n",
