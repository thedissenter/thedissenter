  \ and the Big Five, Big Six and HEXACO personality traits inventories, and the Big\
  \ Two. We start off with an overview of the historical and scientific importance\
  \ of the development of the Big Five personality traits to personality psychology,\
  \ and the scientific rationale behind them, the lexical hypothesis/rationale. Then,\
  \ we discuss the Big Six and the HEXACO, and how these inventories are arrived at.\
  \ We also talk about what would be the goals of the development of these inventories,\
  \ with special emphasis on universality and predictive ability. We discuss briefly\
  \ the ten aspects of the Big Five, and then finish off by talking about the application\
  \ of these inventories to clinical psychology, and the ways by which culture might\
  \ influence personality traits and how they get expressed.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>01:00</time>\
