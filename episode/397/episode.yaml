  \ Testing the Limits (MIT Press, 2005).\n\nIn this episode, we talk about the evolution\
  \ of play. First, we define play from a biological perspective, including five different\
  \ criteria for a particular behavior to be classified as play. We talk about the\
  \ three different categories of play (locomotor, object, and social). We also discuss\
  \ play signals, role reversals, self-handicapping, the diversity of play, its downsides\
  \ and costs, pseudo-copulatory play in spiders, and the surplus resources theory.\
  \ Finally, We address of question of play possibly being behind certain elements\
  \ of human culture, like rituals and religion.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:51  What is\
