	"shownotes": "RECORDED ON FEBRUARY 12th 2024.  \nDr. Seth Robertson is a Lecturer in Philosophy and Associate Director of Undergraduate Studies at Harvard University. His research interests include moral psychology, the history of ethics, early Chinese ethics, social epistemology, virtue ethics, and metaethics. Dr. Robertson\u2019s research focuses on ways in which non-normative information should constrain our normative theorizing. He has written about the intersection of social intelligence and virtue ethics as well as situationist psychology and moral development in the context of early Confucian ethics, and is currently working on epistemic injustice and rhetorical manipulation.\n\nIn this episode, we start by talking about normative theorizing (with a focus on ethics), non-normative information, and how non-normative information should constrain our normative theorizing. We talk about a novel version of metaethical Humean Constructivism: \u201cperspectival naturalism\u201d. We also talk about a pluralist approach to ethics. We discuss Confucian ethics and its moral anti-realist features. Finally, we talk about different forms of epistemic injustice, and what predicts continuation for women in academic philosophy.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:48</time> Normative theorizing, and non-normative information  \n<time>10:21</time> How non-normative information constrains our normative theorizing  \n<time>21:08</time> Perspectival naturalism  \n<time>42:49</time> A pluralist approach to ethics  \n<time>50:13</time> Confucian ethics and its anti-realist features  \n<time>1:06:06</time> Epistemic injustice  \n<time>1:19:47</time> What predicts continuation for women in academic philosophy?  \n<time>1:31:45</time> Follow Dr. Robertson\u2019s work!\n\n---\n\nFollow Dr. Robertson\u2019s work:  \nFaculty page: https://bit.ly/469uw0s  \nWebsite: https://bit.ly/3t8XhLZ  \nPhilPeople profile: https://bit.ly/3t5DgpD\n",
