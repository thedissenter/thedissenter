shownotes: "REUPLOAD OF PETER SINGER'S INTERVIEW\n\n\nDr. Peter Singer is the Ira\
  \ W. DeCamp Professor of Bioethics at Princeton University, and a Laureate Professor\
  \ at the Centre for Applied Philosophy and Public Ethics at the University of Melbourne.\
  \ He specializes in applied ethics and approaches ethical issues from a secular,\
  \ utilitarian perspective. He is known in particular for his book Animal Liberation\
  \ (1975), in which he argues in favor of veganism, and his essay \"Famine, Affluence,\
  \ and Morality\", in which he argues in favor of donating to help the global poor.\
  \ He has written, co-authored, edited or co-edited more than 50 books, including\
  \ Practical Ethics, The Expanding Circle, Rethinking Life and Death, One World,\
  \ The Ethics of What We Eat (with Jim Mason) and The Point of View of the Universe\
  \ (with Katarzyna de Lazari-Radek). His writings have appeared in more than 25 languages.\n\
  \nIn this episode, we first get into how we morality can be objective, and issues\
  \ regarding our evolved morality and its conflicting features, the limitations of\
  \ reason, and if it is possible to derive moral values from science. We talk about\
  \ how personality might influence the philosophies that people develop, and if it\
  \ would be acceptable to nudge people\u2019s behavior through environmental tweaks.\
  \ We then discuss effective altruism and its several flavors, and if we should eliminate\
  \ all suffering. In the latter part of the interview, we talk about some specific\
  \ subjects, like veganism, human enhancement, and euthanasia. Toward the end, we\
  \ also discuss moral foundations theory, and if it should influence the way people\
  \ do moral philosophy.\n\nTime Links:  \n03:11  Can morality be objective?  \n05:37\
