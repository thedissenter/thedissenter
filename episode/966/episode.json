Currently, he works on 19th century philosophy (particularly Nietzsche and Schopenhauer), ethics and its relation to aesthetics, and environmental philosophy. He is the author of Nietzsche's Struggle against Pessimism.\n\nIn this episode, we focus on Nietzsche's Struggle against Pessimism. We start by talking about pessimism and its varieties, and also a bit about its history. We discuss pessimism in the 19th century, with a focus on Schopenhauer. We talk about Nietzsche\u2019s first engagement with pessimism, and the questions we grappled the most with. We discuss pessimism in \u201cHuman, All Too Human\u201d, and a psychological critique of pessimism. We talk about the relationship between pessimism and nihilism. We discuss hedonism, and the value of suffering. Finally, we talk about Nietzsche\u2019s antidotes to pessimism.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:30</time> Varieties of pessimism  \n<time>07:45</time> The history of pessimism  \n<time>11:15</time> Pessimism in the 19th century  \n<time>22:54</time> When Nietzsche first engaged with pessimism  \n<time>31:03</time> Questions Nietzsche grappled with  \n<time>40:05</time> Pessimism in \u201cHuman, All Too Human\u201d  \n<time>48:50</time> A psychological critique of pessimism  \n<time>55:22</time> The relationship between pessimism and nihilism  \n<time>1:02:31</time> Hedonism, and the value of suffering  \n<time>1:12:35</time> Antidotes do pessimism  \n<time>1:18:12</time> Follow Dr. Hassan\u2019s work!\n\n---\n\nFollow Dr. Hassan\u2019s work:  \nFaculty page: https://bit.ly/45qrcwE  \nPhilPeople profile: https://bit.ly/4029VJa  \nNietzsche's Struggle against Pessimism: https://bit.ly/3sFxOtN\n",
