excerpt: Dr. Marjorie Prokosch is a Postdoctoral Scholar in the Disasters, Trust,
  and Social Change Lab at the University of Florida, and an incoming Assistant Professor
  at the Rochester Institute of Technology. She studies social and health-related
  decision-making, with an emphasis on how environmental threats (such as the threat
  posed by infectious disease) and our own condition (e.g., our immune system, developmental
  experiences with harshness) motivate our perceptions and behavior. Specific areas
  of interest include risk perception, self-regulation, and close relationships. In
  her current role at UF, she is examining how environmental hazards (like hurricanes)
  and climate change threats intersect with social inequality to impact decision-making.

  \ Scholar in the Disasters, Trust, and Social Change Lab at the University of Florida,\
  \ and an incoming Assistant Professor at the Rochester Institute of Technology.\
  \ She studies social and health-related decision-making, with an emphasis on how\

  \ threats intersect with social inequality to impact decision-making.\n\nIn this\
  \ episode, we talk about harshness, the immune system, and climate change. We start\
  \ with how harshness impacts psychological development, and how it affects risk\
  \ perception, self-regulation, and close relationships. We talk about the connection\
  \ between the immune system and psychology and behavior. We discuss how threats\
  \ of infectious disease change behavior, and the implications for Public Health.\
  \ Finally, we talk about Dr. Prokosch\u2019s ongoing work on people\u2019s perceptions\
  \ of climate change, and its relationship with inequality.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:00\
