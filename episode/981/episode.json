We start by talking about the premise of the book, and then go through some of Freud\u2019s theories, including the unconscious; repression; trauma; hysteria; the Oedipus Complex; his theory of sexuality; drives, and the death drive; and his theory of culture. Then, we discuss whether Freud was a real scientist, the limitations of his clinical material, and how much credit we should give to him.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:28</time> The premise of the book  \n<time>04:04</time> The unconscious  \n<time>09:59</time> Repression  \n<time>11:17</time> Trauma, and hysteria  \n<time>27:30</time> The Oedipus Complex  \n<time>35:05</time> Freud\u2019s theory of sexuality  \n<time>40:56</time> Drives  \n<time>48:43</time> The death drive  \n<time>54:27</time> A theory of culture  \n<time>1:04:06</time> Was Freud a scientist?  \n<time>1:12:16</time> Freud\u2019s clinical material  \n<time>1:19:38</time> How much credit should we give to Freud?  \n<time>1:22:50</time> Follow Dr. Borch-Jacobsen\u2019s work!\n\n---\n\nFollow Dr. Borch-Jacobsen\u2019s work:  \nFaculty page: https://bit.ly/3Qe7NdQ  \nFreud\u2019s Thinking: https://bit.ly/46vAGYJ\n",
