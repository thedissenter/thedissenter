shownotes: "RECORDED ON DECEMBER 6th, 2019.  \nDr. Laith Al-Shawaf is an Associate\
  \ Professor of Psychology at the University of Colorado Colorado Springs (UCCS).\
  \ Before, he was an Assistant Professor at Bilkent University in Turkey and a Visiting\
  \ Fellow at the Institute for Advanced Study in Berlin, Germany. Laith has taught\
  \ and conducted research in several different countries, and is a member of the\
  \ Arab-German Young Academy (AGYA), as well as an academic adviser at Ideas Beyond\
  \ Borders (IBB).\n\nIn this episode, we go through some of the theoretical foundations\
  \ of Evolutionary Psychology. We first tackle some misconceptions, like the one\
  \ about \u201Cjust-so stories\u201D, how biological mechanisms are designed, genetic\
  \ determinism, and adaptations. We then talk about how hypotheses are generated\
  \ in Evolutionary Psychology, the focus of the discipline on psychological mechanisms\
  \ and not so much on manifest behavior, and the importance of Tinbergen\u2019s 4\
  \ Questions. We also discuss learning, context and environment in Evolutionary Psychology.\
  \ Finally, we address the issue of individual differences, and if we can make predictions\
  \ about how our psychology will evolve in the future.\n\n\nTime Links:  \n00:53\
