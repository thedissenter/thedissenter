	"shownotes": "RECORDED ON NOVEMBER 1st 2024.  \nDr. David Henshall is Professor of Physiology and Medical Physics at the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland. His laboratory is studying cell and molecular mechanisms of epilepsy. His research team combines cell and molecular biology techniques, data science and bioinformatics, pharmacology, neuroscience and behavior, imaging and histology, and employs a range of experimental and human models. He is the author of Fine-Tuning Life: A Guide to MicroRNAs, Your Genome's Master Regulators.\n\nIn this episode, we focus on Fine-Tuning Life. We start by covering some basics of DNA and RNA. We talk about microRNAs: how they were discovered and how we learn about them; how they evolved; how they are produced in cells; their functions and role in fine-tuning life; how they work; and their role in evolution and speciation. We then get specifically into how they work in human development, their role in brain physiology and brain cell structure, cognition and intelligence, and brain disease. Finally, we discuss a new picture of genetics coming from gene regulation and the role of microRNAs.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:33</time> DNA and RNA  \n<time>11:36</time> MicroRNAs: how they were discovered and how we learn about them  \n<time>16:55</time> How microRNAs evolved  \n<time>22:54</time> How they are produced  \n<time>27:05</time> Fine-tuning life  \n<time>30:31</time> How they operate  \n<time>33:15</time> Their role in evolution and speciation  \n<time>38:36</time> Human development  \n<time>43:47</time> Their role in brain physiology and brain cell structure  \n<time>48:32</time> Cognition and intelligence  \n<time>50:36</time> Brain disease  \n<time>56:32</time> A new picture of genetics  \n<time>59:17</time> Follow Dr. Henshall\u2019s work!\n\n---\n\nFollow Dr. Henshall\u2019s work:  \nFaculty page: https://tinyurl.com/4dymwmtz  \nGoogle Scholar page: https://tinyurl.com/5m6mh4jp  \nFine-Tuning Life: https://tinyurl.com/zu3eb6tj  \nTwitter handle: @Prof_DCHenshall\n",
