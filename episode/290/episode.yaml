  \ Kirby Professor of Behavioral Finance and Economics at the California Institute\
  \ of Technology, where he teaches cognitive psychology and economics. His work seeks\
  \ a better understanding of the psychological and neurobiological basis of decision-making\
  \ in order to determine the validity of models of human economic behavior. His research\
  \ uses mostly economics experiments\u2014and occasionally field studies\u2014to\
  \ understand how people behave when making decisions (e.g., risky gambles for money),\
  \ in games, and in markets (e.g., speculative price bubbles). In 2013, Dr. Camerer\
  \ was named a MacArthur Fellow.\n\nIn this episode, we focus on the modern science\
  \ of economics, integrated with cognitive and experimental psychology, and neuroscience.\
  \ We first discuss the different types of decision-making that we are cognitively\
  \ endowed with. We address what rationality is from an economics perspective. We\
  \ talk about the importance of collecting data from different sources to develop\
  \ a full understanding of our cognitive mechanisms, from psychology, economics,\
  \ anthropology and neuroscience. Then, we focus on the current state of the art\
  \ in neuroscience, its limitations as a discipline and at the level of its imaging\
  \ techniques, and the knowledge we can draw from it. We also refer to the limitations\
  \ of lab experiments, and how they can be complemented by field studies in natural\
  \ settings. We also talk about individualist vs collectivist approaches in economics;\
  \ how to think about social norms; and what are \u201Cbeliefs\u201D in economics.\
  \ Finally, we discuss the concept of \u201Crisk\u201D in economics, the factors\
  \ behind risky gambling in the stock market, and possible ways to prevent it.\n\n\
