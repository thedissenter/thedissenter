  \ geneticist, and professor in Harvard University's Department of Organismic and\
  \ Evolutionary Biology. He is interested in intragenomic conflict, genomic imprinting\
  \ and parent\u2013offspring conflict, and wrote the book Genomic Imprinting and\
  \ Kinship. His major contribution to the field of evolutionary theory is the kinship\
  \ theory of genomic imprinting. He\u2019s the author of several books, including\
  \ the most recent one, From Darwin to Derrida: Selfish Genes, Social Selves, and\
  \ the Meanings of Life.\n\nIn this episode, we start off by talking about some basic\
  \ concepts in evolutionary biology, like what is a gene, units of selection, multi-level\
  \ selection theory and group selection. We then get into intragenomic conflict,\
  \ parental antagonism, and parent-offspring conflict. We talk about epigenetics,\
  \ and development in the context of natural selection from a gene-centered perspective.\
  \ Finally, we get into some of the topics from Dr. Haig\u2019s latest book, and\
  \ discuss purpose and meaning.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:54  What is a gene?  \n05:23\
