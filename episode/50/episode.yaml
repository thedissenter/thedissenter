  \ theme of this episode is Dr. Segal\u2019s latest book, Accidental Brothers. We\
  \ start the conversation with some personal questions, about what it was for Dr.\
  \ Segal to live as and have a relationship with her fraternal twin, and also what\
  \ she deemed to be the most interesting findings coming from the MISTRA (Minnesota\
  \ Study of Twins Reared Apart). Subsequent topics include: studies with identical,\
  \ fraternal and virtual twins, and triplets, and what they teach us about human\
  \ nature; how people express themselves more fully as they get independent from\
  \ their family; the nature vs nurture dichotomy, and also nurture via nature and\
  \ nature via nurture approaches; the role of chance in people\u2019s lives; epigenetics\
  \ and the prenatal environment; how behavioral genetics might inform parenting practices;\
  \ and related subjects.  \n \nTime Links:  \n01:08  Growing up as a fraternal twin\
