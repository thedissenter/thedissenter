He is broadly interested in human behavior and culture, and currently has three lines of research: magic, divination, and epistemic norms in small-scale societies; reporting biases in the transmission of instrumental practices; and theoretical modeling of the transmission of culture. \n\nIn this episode, we first talk about magic, divination and dream interpretation across human societies. We also discuss chance-based explanations. We talk about transmission biases in cultural evolution. Finally, we discuss taboos, and why there are so many of them in traditional societies.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:40</time> Magic  \n<time>09:04</time> Divination  \n<time>16:07</time> Dream interpretation  \n<time>25:48</time> Magic and divination in industrialized societies  \n<time>31:17</time> Chance-based explanations  \n<time>36:12</time> Transmission biases  \n<time>50:55</time> Taboos  \n<time>59:22</time> Follow Dr. Hong\u2019s work!\n\n---\n\nFollow Dr. Hong\u2019s work:  \nFaculty page: https://tinyurl.com/4jpp6msm  \nWebsite: https://tinyurl.com/2wdd3c23  \nGoogle Scholar page: https://tinyurl.com/5n96k7ym  \nX handle: @KevinHong1991\n",
