  \ the major topics in Dr. Danaher\u2019s book, Automation and Utopia. We first talk\
  \ about human obsolescence, the present conditions of the labor market, and how\
  \ to improve them through automation. We discuss technological unemployment and\
  \ the Universal Basic Income. Then, we talk about how automation might interfere\
  \ with domains of human life that could impede human flourishing. We also address\
  \ the advantages and disadvantages of turning into cyborgs. Finally, we discuss\
  \ what would be a virtual utopia, and game ethics.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:50  Human\
