	"shownotes": "RECORDED ON MARCH 10th 2025.  \nDr. Kostas Kampourakis is author and editor of several books about science. He works at the Teacher Training Institute and the Section of Biology at the University of Geneva. At the Section of Biology, he teaches the courses \u201cBiologie et Soci\u00e9t\u00e9\u201d and \u201cComprendre l\u2019\u00e9volution\u201d. He is the author and editor of several books, including Darwin Mythology: Debunking Myths, Correcting Falsehoods.\n\nIn this episode, we focus on Darwin Mythology. We start by talking about the problem with hero-worshipping in science, and what is a myth. We then go through several myths and falsehoods associated with Darwin, including whether his ideas were original to him; the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands and the finches; whether Darwin was an armchair theoretician; his reaction to Lamarck\u2019s ideas; Alfred Russell Wallace; whether Darwin\u2019s opponents had good arguments; the origins of the phrase \u201csurvival of the fittest\u201d; essentialism; African human origins; whether Darwin\u2019s theory was revolutionary; and whether it makes sense to question Darwin. Finally, we talk about what we can learn about how science works by debunking such myths.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:35</time> Why a book on Darwin?  \n<time>01:42</time> The problem of hero-worshipping  \n<time>04:57</time> What is a myth?  \n<time>08:14</time> Were Darwin\u2019s ideas original?  \n<time>15:57</time> The Gal\u00e1pagos Islands and the finches  \n<time>19:33</time> Was Darwin an armchair theoretician?  \n<time>23:24</time> Lamarck  \n<time>24:42</time> Darwin\u2019s main ideas  \n<time>25:40</time> Alfred Russell Wallace  \n<time>26:49</time> Darwin\u2019s opponents  \n<time>28:19</time> \u201cSurvival of the fittest\u201d  \n<time>29:40</time> Undermining essentialism  \n<time>32:29</time> African human origins  \n<time>33:31</time> Was Darwin\u2019s theory revolutionary?  \n<time>36:05</time> Can Darwin be questioned?  \n<time>39:04</time> How science works  \n<time>43:40</time> Follow Dr. Kampourakis\u2019 work!\n\n---\n\nFollow Dr. Kampourakis\u2019 work:  \nUniversity page: https://tinyurl.com/mr3u9vuf  \nWebsite: https://tinyurl.com/2seaz49n  \nResearchGate profile: https://tinyurl.com/232chj24  \nDarwin Mythology: https://tinyurl.com/27aspa8t  \nBooks on Amazon: https://tinyurl.com/e6ndw7fu  \nX handle: @KampourakisK\n",
