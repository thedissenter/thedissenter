shownotes: "RECORDED ON JANUARY 13th 2022.  \nDr. Gil Greengross is a Lecturer in\
  \ Psychology at Aberystwyth University. He is an evolutionary psychologist, studying\
  \ the evolutionary roots of everyday behaviors and emotions. His main area of research\
  \ focuses on the evolution of humor and laughter, what makes people laugh, and how\
  \ humor is used in mating and mate choice. He also has a strong interest in studying\
  \ people with extreme creative abilities, such as stand-up comedians, magicians,\
  \ and other artists.\n\nIn this episode, we talk about the evolutionary psychology\
  \ of humor. We start by discussing what humor is. We talk about humor as a product\
  \ of evolution, and its signaling functions. We go through the correlation between\
  \ humor and intelligence, and personality traits. We get into the different humor\
  \ styles, and what explains people\u2019s preferences for one or the other. We discuss\
  \ how humor is contextual, and why it is normal to sometimes feel offended. We talk\
  \ about the psychological traits of professional comedians, and stereotypes people\
  \ have about them. We talk about how people rate their own attempts at humor, and\
  \ how humor appreciation changes across the lifespan. Finally, we discuss sex differences\
  \ in humor production and appreciation, and the different possible explanations\
  \ for them.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:00 Intro  \n00:49  What is humor?  \n07:04  Humor\
