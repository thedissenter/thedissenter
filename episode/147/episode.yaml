  \ to Oxford's Practical Ethics: Ethics in the News blog.\n\nIn this episode, the\
  \ central topic of discussion is philosophy of psychiatry. We go through some of\
  \ the difficulties in classifying something as a \u201Cmental disease\u201D, and\
  \ even the social and moral aspects of it. We also talk about certain specific issues,\
  \ like depression, mental suffering, suicide and euthanasia; human enhancement in\
  \ psychiatry, the difference between enhancement and therapy, and the ethics behind\
  \ it; and also when and how people should resort to psychiatry and neuroscience\
  \ in the penal system, and issue regarding free will and moral responsibility. Toward\
  \ the end, Dr. Roache also tells us about her upcoming book on swearing.\n\nTime\
