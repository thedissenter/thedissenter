	"shownotes": "RECORDED ON JUNE 13th 2024.  \nDr. Kostas Kampourakis is author and editor of several books about science. He works at the Teacher Training Institute and the Section of Biology at the University of Geneva. At the Section of Biology, he teaches the courses \u201cBiologie et Soci\u00e9t\u00e9\u201d and \u201cComprendre l\u2019\u00e9volution\u201d. He is the author of several books, the latest one being Ancestry Reimagined: Dismantling the Myth of Genetic Ethnicities. He is also the Editor of the book series Understanding Life, published by Cambridge University Press.\n\nIn this episode, we focus on Ancestry Reimagined. We talk about DNA ancestry testing, and common misconceptions people have about it. We discuss issues with terms like \u201cnationality\u201d, \u201cethnicity\u201d, and \u201crace\u201d, and the idea of biological essentialism. We discuss whether it makes sense to talk about genes being from particular groups of people or regions of the globe. We talk about human populations, and the concept of cline. We discuss the differences between genetic ancestry and genealogical ancestry. We talk about how much human groups really differ genetically, and how we are all ultimately African. Finally, we discuss the idea of a \u201cnatural order\u201d, the social consequences of genetic essentialism, and also the positive effects of learning about ancestry.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:36</time> DNA ancestry testing  \n<time>01:32</time> Common misconceptions about DNA testing  \n<time>05:51</time> Terms like \u201cnationality\u201d, \u201cethnicity\u201d, and \u201crace\u201d  \n<time>17:47</time> Biological essentialism  \n<time>21:43</time> Are genes from groups of people or regions?  \n<time>29:38</time> Human \u201cpopulations\u201d  \n<time>33:05</time> Clines  \n<time>34:46</time> Genetic ancestry and genealogical ancestry  \n<time>38:55</time> We are all ultimately African  \n<time>41:53</time> How much do human groups differ genetically?  \n<time>46:55</time> A \u201cnatural order\u201d, and the social consequences of genetic essentialism  \n<time>53:16</time> The positive effects of learning about ancestry  \n<time>56:37</time> Follow Dr. Kampourakis\u2019 work!\n\n---\n\nFollow Dr. Kampourakis\u2019 work:  \nUniversity page: https://tinyurl.com/mr3u9vuf  \nWebsite: https://tinyurl.com/2seaz49n  \nResearchGate profile: https://tinyurl.com/232chj24  \nAncestry Reimagined: https://tinyurl.com/3xnv7sfe  \nBooks on Amazon: https://tinyurl.com/e6ndw7fu  \nTwitter handle: @KampourakisK\n",
