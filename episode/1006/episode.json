	"shownotes": "RECORDED ON JANUARY 8th 2024.  \nDr. Anna Alexandrova is a Professor in Philosophy of Science at the Department of History and Philosophy of Science at the University of Cambridge and a Fellow of King's College. She does work in philosophy of economics, philosophy of social science, measurement in social and medical sciences, social organization of science, philosophy of mental health/psychotherapy/wellbeing, evidence-based policy and role of science in governance; and more. She is the editor of Limits of the Numerical: The Abuses and Uses of Quantification.\n\nIn this episode, we focus on Limits of the Numerical. We discuss what quantification is; whether quantitative data are precise, value-free, and objective; whether qualitative date are of inferior quality; and C. P. Snow\u2019s two cultures, and their social and political consequences. We talk about the limits and strengths of quantification, society\u2019s relationship to numerical data, and whether it is ethical to manipulate the public with numbers if they have good social effects. We discuss thick concepts, and why they present a challenge to science; the democratization of measurement; and pluralism in science. Throughout the interview, we explore the example of how we conceptualize and quantify wellbeing.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:33</time> What is quantification?  \n<time>03:20</time> Are quantitative data precise, value-free, and objective?  \n<time>07:16</time> Are qualitative data of inferior value?  \n<time>17:34</time> C.
