Her research interests include mobility and dietary adaptations in archaeological human populations; African strontium isoscapes and isotopic investigations of the Atlantic and transatlantic slave trade; the dietary ecology of extant African great apes; great ape breastfeeding and weaning; and chimpanzee tool use and termite-chimpanzee interactions.\n\nIn this episode, we talk about the study of the Atlantic and transatlantic slave trade through African strontium isoscapes and isotopic investigations. We focus specifically on a mass burial site at Vale da Galfaria, in Portugal. Finally, we discuss how scientists should deal with human remains, and whether they should go back to their communities.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:37</time> Studying the Atlantic and transatlantic slave trade  \n<time>07:42</time> A mass burial at Vale da Galfaria, Portugal  \n<time>27:18</time> The Ancestor Tribute  \n<time>35:41</time> Should humans remains go back to their communities?  \n<time>50:24</time> Follow Dr. Oelze\u2019s work!\n\n---\n\nFollow Dr. Oelze\u2019s work:  \nFaculty page: https://tinyurl.com/2s3vbxsn  \nResearchGate profile: https://tinyurl.com/2p9jnkys\n",
