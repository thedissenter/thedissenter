shownotes: "RECORDED ON AUGUST 16th 2021.  \nDr. Iddo Landau is a Professor of Philosophy\
  \ at the University of Haifa. He has written extensively on the meaning of life.\
  \ He is the author of Finding Meaning in an Imperfect World.\n\nIn this episode,\
  \ we focus on Finding Meaning in an Imperfect World. We start by discussing what\
  \ is meaning, and how we decide that a life is meaningful of meaningless. We go\
  \ through different criteria to determine the meaningfulness of life: the perfectionist\
  \ view of life; the importance of freedom; if life has to be moral; if an unexamined\
  \ life is worth living; if life has to be planned or have goals; if people need\
  \ a purpose; suffering; antinatalism, and Benatar\u2019s perspective; good and bad\
  \ experiences, and how they weigh on the balance of meaning; our insignificance\
  \ from the point of view of the Universe; death; suicide; and religion and systems\
  \ of value. We also talk about the meaningfulness of lives of other animals, and\
  \ their moral status. Finally, we discuss potential arguments that could convince\
  \ desperate people that they lives are meaningful. \n\nTime Links:  \n00:00  Intro\
