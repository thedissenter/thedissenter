excerpt: Dr. Robert Barton is Professor in the Department of Anthropology, Member
  of the Durham Cultural Evolution Research Centre at Durham University, UK. He is
  an evolutionary biologist/anthropologist interested in brains, behavior and cognition,
  using phylogenetic comparative methods to study how these traits evolved. He developed
  and tested the 'Visual brain hypothesis' for primate brain size evolution. He is
  currently interested in the underestimated role of the cerebellum in brain evolution
  and cognition. He also works on the evolutionary and cultural significance of the
  color red.

  \ Department of Anthropology, Member of the Durham Cultural Evolution Research Centre\
  \ at Durham University, UK. He is an evolutionary biologist/anthropologist interested\
  \ in brains, behavior and cognition, using phylogenetic comparative methods to study\
  \ how these traits evolved. He developed and tested the 'Visual brain hypothesis'\
  \ for primate brain size evolution. He is currently interested in the underestimated\
  \ role of the cerebellum in brain evolution and cognition. He also works on the\
  \ evolutionary and cultural significance of the color red.\n\nIn this episode, we\
  \ talk about the evolution of the primate brain. We talk about the relationship\
  \ between the brain, cognition, and behavior. We discuss ecological and social factors\
  \ behind the evolution of the primate brain. We talk specifically about sexual selection,\
  \ social selection, life history, and maternal investment. We talk about the evolution\
  \ of the cerebellum and its functions. We explain why cognition cannot be disembodied.\
  \ We talk about the \u201Cvisual brain hypothesis\u201D. We discuss the growth of\
  \ the primate brain, and specifically the hominin brain, and ask if there is anything\
  \ unique about the human brain. Finally, we talk about the evolution of the color\
  \ red, and what it signals.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:00 Intro  \n00:58  The relationship\
