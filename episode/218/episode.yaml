  \nIn this episode, we talk about science and Big Data, based mostly on Dr. Leonelli\u2019\
  s book, Data-Centric Biology. We discuss the relationship between data and science;\
  \ data classification; bio-ontologies; what are curators, their role, and their\
  \ relationship with scientists and researchers. We also talk about the processes\
  \ of decontextualizing and recontextualizing data, and data travels; and how political\
  \ and financial powers might interfere with the production of scientific knowledge.\
  \ Toward the end, we also talk about the role that model organisms have played in\
  \ Biology, and the potential of synthetic biology.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>01:15</time>\
