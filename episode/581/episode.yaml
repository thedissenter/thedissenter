excerpt: Dr. Robert Larzelere is Professor and Research Methodologist in the College
  of Education and Human Sciences at Oklahoma State University. He is interested in
  collaborating with others who are concerned about the best scientific evidence on
  important questions about family and family-type relationships. He investigates
  specific disciplinary processes that account for the effectiveness of the authoritative
  parenting combination of warmth, communication, just-firm-enough control and increasing
  autonomy. He is interested in comparing the effectiveness of alternative disciplinary
  responses to misbehavior and searching for alternative tactics that are more effective
  than non-abusive spanking in situations where the latter has traditionally been
  used.

  \ Research Methodologist in the College of Education and Human Sciences at Oklahoma\
  \ State University. He is interested in collaborating with others who are concerned\
  \ about the best scientific evidence on important questions about family and family-type\

  \ for alternative tactics that are more effective than non-abusive spanking in situations\
  \ where the latter has traditionally been used.\n\nIn this episode, we talk about\
  \ parenting and parenting tactics like spanking. We first discuss parenting styles,\
  \ and temperamental differences in children. We get more into detail about authoritative\
  \ parenting. We talk about spanking, when it is effective, when it is abusive, and\
  \ alternatives to it. We also discuss the effects of spanking bans, with focus on\
  \ Sweden. Finally, we talk about what can be the negative outcomes of adopting the\
  \ wrong style of parenting, particularly when dealing with the more defiant children.\n\
