  \ we talk about a recent paper - Politics and Academic Values in Higher Education:\
  \ Just How Much Does Political Orientation Drive the Values of the Ivory Tower?\
  \  We first talk about academic values, particularly academic rigor, academic freedom,\
  \ student emotional well-being, social justice, and the advancement of knowledge.\
  \ We then get into the story behind the publication of the paper, Jonathan Haidt\u2019\
  s talk at New Paltz, what led to the study it, how the study was designed, among\
  \ other aspects of the process. We discuss the conclusions of the paper, and we\
  \ end by talking about how academia should deal with these academic values and the\
  \ biases that arise from personality, political orientation, gender, and field of\
  \ expertise.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:42</time> Academic\
