  \ go through concepts and ideas explored in the book, like \u201Cnow\u201D, \u201C\
  past-present-future\u201D, the fear of death, life as suffering, what it is to \u201C\
  exist\u201D, solipsism, and birth. We discuss antinatalism. We talk about issues\
  \ in modern industrialized societies, and current trends in Japanese culture and\
  \ society. Finally, we talk about manga as a cultural phenomenon in Japan and as\
  \ a medium to explore philosophical ideas.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:00 Intro  \n01:05\
