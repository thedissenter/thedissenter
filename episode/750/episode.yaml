shownotes: "RECORDED ON FEBRUARY 8th 2023.  \nDr. Adam Rutherford is Lecturer in Biology\
  \ and Society at University College London\u2019s Department of Genes, Evolution,\
  \ and Environment, and President of Humanists UK. His interests are in evolution,\
  \ genetics and developmental biology, and the history of biology. He has written\
  \ extensively on Darwin, the development of evolutionary theory, the Modern Synthesis,\
  \ early microscopy, synthetic biology and genetic engineering, behavioral ecology,\
  \ gene-culture co-evolution, human evolution, and ancient DNA. He is the author\
  \ of several books, including Control: The Dark History and Troubling Present of\
  \ Eugenics.\n\nIn this episode, we focus on Control. We start by discussing what\
  \ eugenics is, and how old it is as an ideology. We discuss if it makes sense to\
  \ talk about \u201Cgood\u201D and \u201Cbad\u201D traits in evolutionary biology,\
  \ and the importance of genetic diversity. We talk about medical interventions.\
  \ We get into eugenics in the early 20th century, and how widespread it was in the\
  \ West. We talk about how some geneticists contributed to eugenics. We discuss the\
  \ concept of \u201Crace\u201D. We talk about behavior genetics, and group differences.\
  \ We also get into eugenics in contemporary academia and politics, and talk about\
  \ the \u201Cgreat replacement theory\u201D conspiracy theory. Finally, we discuss\
  \ if we should be worried about genetic engineering.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time>\
