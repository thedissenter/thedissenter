	"shownotes": "RECORDED ON MARCH 4th 2025.  \nCody Moser is a PhD candidate and Fletcher Jones Fellow in the Department of Cognitive and Information Sciences at UC Merced, and a 2024 Junior Fellow at The Institute for Humane Studies. He works on questions examining the relationship between structure and adaptation in social, biological, economic, and neural systems from a complex systems perspective. To do this, he utilizes methods from network theory, agent-based modeling, and large-scale corpus analysis.\n\nIn this episode, we first discuss collective intelligence. We then delve into cultural innovation, and talk about different structures of social networks and which of them facilitate cultural innovation. We also talk about factors that play a role in cultural innovation; inequality, and genius effects; and cumulative cultural evolution. Finally, we talk about infant-directed speech, and music and the diversity of songs.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:41</time> Collective intelligence  \n<time>11:04</time> Cultural innovation  \n<time>12:42</time> Social networks and cultural innovation  \n<time>29:22</time> Factors that play a role in cultural innovation  \n<time>36:44</time> Inequality, and genius effects  \n<time>39:14</time> Cumulative cultural evolution  \n<time>41:10</time> Infant-directed speech  \n<time>49:29</time> Music and the diversity of songs  \n<time>55:32</time> Follow Cody\u2019s work!\n\n---\n\nFollow Cody\u2019s work:  \nUniversity page: https://tinyurl.com/2zd5dsuu  \nWebsite: https://culturologies.co/  \nGoogle Scholar page: https://tinyurl.com/mr33prdc\n",
