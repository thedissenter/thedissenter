He is a complexity scientist who works in the field of historical social science that he and his colleagues call cliodynamics. He is the author of books like War and Peace and War, Ages of Discord, Ultrasociety, End Times, and The Great Holocene Transformation.\n\nIn this episode, we start by talking about what causes political communities to cohere, and what causes the collapse of complex societies. We discuss the phenomenon of elite overproduction, its social and political consequences, and modern elite overproduction since the late 1970s. We talk about social unrest in the US and Western Europe in the current decade. Finally, we discuss whether violence is inevitable, and how we can solve elite overproduction in a non-violent way.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:39</time> What causes political communities to cohere, and what causes them to fall apart?  \n<time>07:17</time> What causes the collapse of complex societies?  \n<time>18:26</time> Elite overproduction, and its social and political consequences  \n<time>22:55</time> Elite overproduction since the late 1970s  \n<time>32:14</time> Social unrest in the US and Western Europe in the 2020s  \n<time>38:05</time> Is violence inevitable?  \n<time>43:41</time> Solving elite overproduction in a non-violent way  \n<time>46:53</time> Follow Dr. Turchin\u2019s work!\n\n---\n\nFollow Dr. Turchin\u2019s work:  \nWebsite: https://peterturchin.com/  \nSubstack: https://tinyurl.com/3fexw3dv  \nBooks on Amazon: https://tinyurl.com/5nst67ya  \nTwitter handle: @Peter_Turchin\n",
