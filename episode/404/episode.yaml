shownotes: "RECORDED ON SEPTEMBER 30th 2020.  \nDr. Hanno Sauer is Assistant Professor\
  \ of Philosophy at Utrecht University. His main research interests are in moral\
  \ psychology and empirically informed metaethics. He is interested in whether and\
  \ how we can bring empirical data from diverse disciplines such as social psychology,\
  \ neuroscience or cognitive science to bear on questions of normative and/or metaethical\
  \ interests, and what the limits of this approach are. He is the author of Moral\
  \ Judgments as Educated Intuitions (2017), Debunking Arguments in Ethics (2018),\
  \ and Moral Thinking, Fast and Slow (2018).\n\nIn this episode, we tackle lots of\
  \ approaches, challenges and arguments in (meta)ethics. We basically go through\
  \ some of the biggest questions that ethics and moral philosophy try to answer.\
  \ We deal with the relationship between science and ethics, and the is-ought gap.\
  \ We discuss intuitionism, moral realism, evolutionary psychology and moral relativism,\
  \ and moral nihilism. We address the recent literature on human rationality. We\
  \ talk about the anti-rationalist and the emotionist challenge. We touch on Moral\
  \ Foundations Theory, and the implications it might have for ethics and moral philosophy.\
  \ We get into the argument from agreement and the argument from disagreement, and\
  \ the challenges they pose to moral realism. We also talk about the educated intuitions\
  \ account of morality. Finally, we discuss if moral progress really exists.\n\n\
  Time Links:  \n00:55  Why it is not a good idea to speculate about the moral nature\
  \ of the human mind without scientifically investigating how it works  \n07:39 \
  \ Is there a way to bridge the is-ought gap?  \n17:08  Does all ethics boil down\
  \ to intuitions?  \n26:41  Is there still any room for moral realism nowadays? \
  \ \n33:15  Does evolutionary psychology force us to accept moral relativism?   \n\
  50:16  Moral nihilism  \n57:15  Are humans rational?  \n1:13:11  The emotionist\
  \ challenge  \n1:19:15  Moral Foundations Theory, and the possible implications\
  \ for moral philosophy  \n1:27:15  The argument from agreement, and the argument\
  \ from disagreement  \n1:36:53  The educated intuitions account of morality  \n\
