shownotes: "RECORDED ON OCTOBER 5th 2020.  \nDr. Caleb Scharf is the director of the\
  \ multidisciplinary Columbia Astrobiology Center at Columbia University. He works\
  \ in the fields of exoplanetary science and astrobiology, and writes extensively\
  \ about science for a popular audience. One ultimate goal of his research is to\
  \ find planets that could harbor recognizable life, and to detect the presence of\
  \ that life\u2014an effort that falls under the banner of astrobiology.\n\nIn this\
  \ episode, we talk about astrobiology and exoplanetary science. We start with a\
  \ bit of the history behind astrobiology. We go through topics like what is a habitable\
  \ zone; several hypotheses as to how life might have originated on Earth; places\
  \ in our solar system and on exoplanets that could harbor life, with focus on Europa,\
  \ Enceladus, and Mars, and how we can detect it. We talk specifically about the\
  \ recent finding of phosphine on Venus. We finish with a discussion on the search\
  \ for intelligent life.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:39</time> A bit of history about\
