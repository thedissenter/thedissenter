  \ at the University of Cape Town in Cape Town, South Africa. He is best known for\
  \ his advocacy of anti-natalism in his book Better Never to Have Been: The Harm\
  \ of Coming into Existence, in which he argues that coming into existence is a serious\

  s Leading University in Decline.\n\nIn this episode, we focus on The Fall of the\
  \ University of Cape Town. Dr. Benatar gives us a brief overview of how the decline\
  \ at UCT started, how it was dealt with, and the demands made by the students. We\
  \ talk about terms like \u201Ctransformation\u201D and \u201Cdecolonization\u201D\
  \ of the curricula. We discuss the role of university, and academic freedom. We\
  \ talk about racial issues in South Africa, affirmative action, cancel culture,\
  \ and identity politics. Finally, we ask if there are any good solutions to what\
  \ is happening at UCT.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:36</time>\
