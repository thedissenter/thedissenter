  \ Fellow in the Cognitive Development Center at Central European University. He\
  \ is a cognitive scientist broadly interested in the evolution and development of\
  \ social cognition. His research focuses on how the mind represents the social world\
  \ in terms of its constituent interactions, relations, and structures. He strives\
  \ to develop a mechanistically tractable account of how humans from the first years\
  \ of life form and flexibly transition among these representations.\n\nIn this episode,\
  \ we talk about how infants interpret giving and taking actions, and the development\
  \ of prosociality. We start with giving and taking actions, and talk about expectations\
  \ surrounding giving; how infants think about possession; norms of ownership, and\
  \ how they vary cross-culturally; expectations surrounding reciprocation; how infants\
  \ infer social relations from giving and taking actions; and how giving actions\
  \ influence how they encode objects. We then get into prosociality, and ask if infants\
  \ prefer helpers or hinderers. Finally, we discuss if there are stages of development\
  \ for prosociality.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:00 Intro  \n00:43  How infants interpret\
  \ giving and taking actions  \n11:38  Do infants expect giving actions in certain\
  \ situations?  \n13:55  Expectations about possession  \n18:09  Norms of ownership\
  \  \n33:11  Do infants expect giving to be reciprocated?  \n36:58  How do infants\
  \ infer social relations from giving and taking actions?  \n44:48  How giving actions\
  \ influence how infants encode objects  \n48:05  Do infants prefer helpers or hinderers?\
