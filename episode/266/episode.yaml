shownotes: "RECORDED ON SEPTEMBER 27th, 2019.  \nDr. Lyn Wadley is jointly Honorary\
  \ Professor of Archaeology in the School of Geography, Archaeology and Environmental\
  \ Studies, and the Evolutionary Studies Institute, at University of the Witwatersrand,\
  \ South Africa. She directs a Wits-recognized programme called ACACIA (Ancient Cognition\
  \ and Culture in Africa). Her specialty is the African Stone Age: Middle Stone Age\
  \ (which lasted from approximately 300,000 to 25,000 years ago) and Later Stone\
  \ Age (the last 25,000 years). She began her career researching social and ecological\
  \ issues during the past 25,000 years of the Later Stone Age in southern Africa.\
  \ Data for her interpretations were obtained from sites in Namibia and South Africa.\
  \ Dr. Wadley\u2019s current research is dedicated to the cognition of people who\
  \ lived in the Middle Stone Age.\n\nIn this episode, we talk about how we can learn\
  \ more about the evolution of human cognition through Archaeology. We discuss how\
  \ we can make inferences about human cognitive abilities from artifacts, and also\
  \ their limitations. We got through specific abilities, like imagination, planning,\
  \ analogical reasoning, multitasking, and symbolism, and how a big part of them\
  \ have a social ingredient. We address the question of what is a modern human. We\
  \ also talk about the interplay between technology and cognition. Dr. Wadley tells\
  \ us what she learned by studying the production of compound adhesives. Finally,\
  \ we address topics like the respect we should have for the cognitive capacity of\
  \ people who lived in traditional societies; the potential impact of modern culture\
  \ in the evolution of our cognition; and our shared human nature.\n\nTime Links:\
