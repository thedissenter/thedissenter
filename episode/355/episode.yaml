  \ Professor in the Department of Integrated Biology, and Director of the Program\
  \ in Ecology, Evolutionary Biology & Behavior at Michigan State University. She\
  \ is also Principal Investigator at the Holekamp Lab. She is recognized as one of\

  \ of Arts and Sciences, being named a fellow of the Animal Behavior Society, and\
  \ a Merriam Award from the American Society of Mammalogists. \n\nIn this episode,\
  \ we talk about Dr. Holekamp\u2019s work on spotted hyenas, and some general topics\
  \ of animal behavior. We start with the main aspects of spotted hyenas\u2019 sociality.\
  \ And then we talk about epigenetics and the extended evolutionary synthesis, and\
  \ the evolution of general intelligence.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>01:11</time> Why\
  \ study hyenas?  \n<time>04:38</time> The interplay between genetics and the ecology\
  \  \n<time>09:45</time> Spotted hyenas\u2019 sociality (aggression, dominance hierarchies,\
  \ hunting, and the effects of prenatal androgens)  \n<time>17:55</time> Epigenetics,\
  \ and the extended evolutionary synthesis  \n<time>21:07</time> The evolution of\
  \ general intelligence (in mammals)  \n<time>26:28</time> Can we extrapolate from\
  \ spotted hyenas to other species (including humans)?  \n<time>29:16</time> Diet,\
  \ hunting, social structure, and intelligence  \n  Follow Dr. Holekamp\u2019s work!\n\
