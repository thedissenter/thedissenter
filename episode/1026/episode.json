We start by discussing what an anthropology of anthropology is. We talk about the importance of outcomes and the results of publications in Anthropology. We discuss whether anthropology can be apolitical. We talk about culture, what cultural anthropology studies, and the challenges of ethnographic fieldwork. We discuss how the academic context shapes the practice of cultural anthropology, the drawbacks of specialization, and postcolonialism. Finally, we talk about public anthropology, and ethics for anthropology, the importance of collaboration across anthropological subfields, and obstacles to public anthropology.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:37</time> An anthropology of anthropology  \n<time>05:07</time> Focusing on outcomes, and what results from anthropological publications  \n<time>12:02</time> Can anthropology be apolitical?  \n<time>18:05</time> What is culture?  \n<time>24:22</time> What does cultural anthropology study?  \n<time>27:41</time> The challenges of ethnographic work  \n<time>32:32</time> How the academic context shapes the practice of cultural anthropology  \n<time>41:28</time> The drawbacks of specialization  \n<time>44:11</time> What is postcolonialism?  \n<time>51:10</time> Public anthropology  \n<time>55:14</time> An ethics of anthropology  \n<time>58:58</time> Collaboration across anthropological subfields  \n<time>1:01:30</time> Obstacles to public anthropology  \n<time>1:07:29</time> Follow Dr. Borofsky\u2019s work!\n\n---\n\nFollow Dr. Borofsky\u2019s work:  \nFaculty page: http://bit.ly/3GQeIEd  \nResearchGate profile: https://bit.ly/3walrUr  \nCenter for a Public Anthropology: http://bit.ly/3HYdMON\n",
