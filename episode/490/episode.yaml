shownotes: "RECORDED ON APRIL 1st 2021.  \nDr. Mark Stoneking directs the Human Population\
  \ History Group in the Department of Evolutionary Genetics at the Max Planck Institute\
  \ for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany. He is also Honorary Professor\
  \ of Biological Anthropology at the University of Leipzig. Dr. Stoneking\u2019s\
  \ research uses molecular genetic approaches to address questions of anthropological\
  \ interest concerning the origins, migrations, structure, and relationships of human\
  \ populations. He, along with his doctoral advisor Allan Wilson and a fellow researcher\
  \ Rebecca L. Cann, contributed to the Out of Africa Theory in 1987 by introducing\
  \ the concept of Mitochondrial Eve, a hypothetical common mother of all living humans\
  \ based on mitochondrial DNA.\n\nIn this episode, we talk about evolutionary genetics.\
  \ We start by talking about the discipline of evolutionary genetics, and the kinds\
  \ of questions it tries to answer. We then talk about the Mitochondrial Eve, the\
  \ interaction between nuclear and mitochondrial DNA, and how to study paternal lineages.\
  \ We discuss human genetic diversity, and if the concept of \u201Crace\u201D is\
  \ a scientific one. We then address how genetics can help us understand cultural\
  \ evolution, and talk specifically about is it is possible to study the evolution\
  \ of languages through genetics. We tackle other questions about our evolution,\
  \ including if it is possible to tell which hominin species we evolved from, and\
  \ why we find less diversity out of Africa. We discuss a study Dr. Stoneking did\
  \ on the Mlabri, and if contemporary hunter-gatherer societies are good models of\
  \ ancient ones. Finally, we talk about evidence of recent genetic evolution.\n\n\
