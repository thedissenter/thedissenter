	"shownotes": "RECORDED ON FEBRUARY 25th 2025.  \nDr. Karoline Wiesner is Professor of Complexity Sciences at the University of Potsdam. Interested in the sciences of complexity, Dr. Wiesner began to work on information theoretic representations of complex systems as a PostDoc at the Santa Fe Institute (USA) and the University of California, Davis. Her work centered around information theoretic representations of quantum dynamical systems. Her research focuses on the use of information theory in the study of formation, maintenance and stability of complex systems. She is co-author of \u201cWhat Is a Complex System?\u201d.\n\nIn this episode, we focus on \u201cWhat Is a Complex System?\u201d. We start by talking about the history of complexity science, the features of a complex system, and emergence. We then go through examples of phenomena and scientific disciplines complexity science applies to, including physics, climate science, the eusocial insects, and neuroscience. We discuss whether the behavior of a complex system can be predicted, and whether complexity science is one single scientific theory. Finally, we talk about the future of complexity science.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:26</time> Complexity science and its history  \n<time>12:07</time> The features of a complex system  \n<time>16:46</time> Emergence  \n<time>21:55</time> The scientific disciplines complexity science applies to  \n<time>25:19</time> Physics  \n<time>28:31</time> Climate science  \n<time>31:23</time> Eusocial insects  \n<time>36:51</time> The economy  \n<time>41:11</time> Neuroscience  \n<time>45:59</time> Can the behavior of a complex system be predicted?  \n<time>49:06</time> Is complexity science a single scientific theory?  \n<time>51:59</time> The future of complexity science  \n<time>54:56</time> Follow Dr. Wiesner\u2019s work!\n\n---\n\nFollow Dr. Wiesner\u2019s work:  \nFaculty page: https://tinyurl.com/2tekaec7  \nWebsite: https://tinyurl.com/e85pw6mv  \nResearchGate profile: https://tinyurl.com/2sbzjvjy  \nWhat Is a Complex System?: https://tinyurl.com/3cbzwkfs\n",
