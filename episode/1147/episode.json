We start by talking about medical error, whether doctors are essential, barriers in accessing medicine, and symptom denial. We discuss which are the better interviewers: doctors or computers. We talk about the limitations of doctors in diagnostics and treatment, and whether AI can do better. We discuss whether AI can be biased.
