  \ F. and Kate Edelman Johnson Professor of Law and Professor by courtesy of Genetics\
  \ at Stanford University, and also an Elected Fellow of the American Association\
  \ for the Advancement of Science. He specializes in the ethical, legal, and social\
  \ implications of new biomedical technologies, particularly those related to neuroscience,\
  \ genetics, or stem cell research. He is a founder and president of the International\
  \ Neuroethics Society; a member of the Multi-Council Working Group of the NIH\u2019\
  s BRAIN Initiative, whose Neuroethics Working Group he co-chairs; a member of the\
  \ Committee on Science, Technology, and Law of the National Academies; and chair\
  \ of California\u2019s Human Stem Cell Research Advisory Committee. He\u2019s also\
  \ the author of The End of Sex and the Future of Human Reproduction.\n\nIn this\
  \ episode, we focus on Dr. Greely\u2019s book, The End of Sex. First, Dr. Greely\
  \ gives us an overview of the different types of assisted reproductive technology\
  \ that go into easy PDG ((Preimplantation Genetic Diagnosis), and to what extent\
  \ they are develop, and how long it would take for them to be cheaper, safer and\
  \ better. Then we talk about questions surrounding access to easy PGD, and equity.\
  \ We also tackle genetic engineering. We discuss some of the political and social\
  \ reactions and consequences of easy PGD, including the possibility of some people\
  \ becoming \u201Cuniparents\u201D. Finally, we debate the extent to which parents\
  \ should be held responsible for the decisions they make about how they modify their\
  \ children, and Dr. Greely tells us if we can expect easy PGD to be, generally,\
  \ a positive or a negative thing for human society.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>01:00</time>\
