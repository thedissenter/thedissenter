  In this episode, we talk about the cognitive science of religion. First, we discuss\
  \ how religion is a multifaceted phenomenon, its evolutionary bases, and the complicated\
  \ causal relationship between beliefs and actions. Then, we talk about religions\
  \ rituals, what they are about, and the effects they have on people, particularly\
  \ the high-arousal ones. We also refer to costly signaling in the context of religion,\
  \ and its relationship to trust, and how socioeconomic factors and natural disasters\
  \ influence adherence to religion. Finally, we talk about some philosophical aspects\
  \ of religion, like the one related to meaning, and how by studying religion we\
  \ can get insights into other social domains of human life.\n\nTime Links:  \n01:30\
