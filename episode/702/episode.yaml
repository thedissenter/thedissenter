  \ at California State University, Fullerton, and a Visiting Research Associate at\
  \ the Economic Science Institute at Chapman University. Dr. Schniter does research\
  \ in evolutionary anthropology, behavioral economics, and evolutionary psychology.\
  \ He has been examining the development of skill, knowledge, and material production\

  \ Finally, Dr. Schniter is interested in how emotions calibrate personal and interpersonal\
  \ behaviors, contributing to relationship maintenance and well-being.\n\nIn this\
  \ episode, we talk about skill and knowledge acquisition, and trust-based interactions.\
  \ We start by talking about the acquisition of skill, knowledge, and material production\
  \ across the lifespan in foraging societies. We also discuss ethnobiological knowledge,\
  \ sex differences in knowledge acquisition and specialization, and storytelling\
  \ skills. We then get into how human relationships are maintained, with a focus\
  \ on trust. We discuss how promises, apologies, and confessions build and rebuild\
  \ trust. We talk about dishonesty and mistrust, and gender stereotypes associated\
  \ with them. We talk about trust games, and what we can learn from them. Finally,\
  \ we discuss the role that risk plays in the evolution of human exchange.\n\nTime\
