shownotes: "RECORDED ON OCTOBER 22nd, 2019.  \nAaron Rabinowitz is an Adjunct Professor\
  \ (PTL) in the Rutgers Philosophy department and the Rutgers Honors College. He\
  \ specializes in ethics, metaethics, and AI. His work focuses on developing a secular\
  \ moral realism that is compatible with the problem of moral luck. He also hosts\
  \ two philosophy podcasts: Philosophers in Space and Embrace the Void. The goal\
  \ of both shows is to make philosophy accessible for everyone, using science fiction\
  \ and existential horror.\n\nIn this episode, we discuss metaethics, and moral realism.\
  \ We first go through the definitions of moral realism and objective morality. Then\
  \ we get into several different issues, like our conflicting moral intuitions, moral\
  \ foundations, and the limitations of our evolved morality. We also talk about moral\
  \ nihilism, and moral relativism. We discuss the differences between knowledge produced\
  \ by science and moral truths (and value judgments). In the latter part of the conversation,\
  \ we discuss to what extent moral axioms also apply to people\u2019s decisions about\
  \ their own wellbeing; the fact that we don\u2019t have direct access to other people\u2019\
  s minds and its moral implications, when it comes to paternalism; and also to what\
  \ extent we should care about how we treat other animals and, in the future, advanced\
  \ AI systems.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>01:11</time> Can Aaron convince me that moral\

  \ If moral truths are instantiated in the Universe, where do they come from?  \n\
  <time>37:50</time> What about moral nihilists, and moral relativists?  \n<time>43:45</time>\
  \ Are moral truths equivalent to scientific truths?  \n<time>46:49</time> We are\
  \ stuck with our evolved moral epistemology  \n<time>57:09</time> Should we take\
  \ seriously people deciding on moral truths by voting?  \n<time>1:03:50</time> Do\
  \ moral truths also apply to how people deal with their own wellbeing?  \n<time>1:10:08</time>\
