We talk about the diploma divide, and trends that led to it since the 1980s. We discuss the demographics of the diploma divide, the \u201cculture war\u201d and how it manifests politically, the contrast between Obama and Trump, the divide between your men and young women, differences between Democrats and Republicans, and attitudes toward experts and institutions, the media, and corporations. We also talk about how the divide manifested in terms of policymaking during the COVID-19 pandemic. Finally, we discuss whether there is a solution to this divide.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:30</time> The diploma divide  \n<time>01:47</time> Trends that led to the divide  \n<time>07:10</time> The demographics of the diploma divide  \n<time>09:55</time> The \u201cculture war\u201d  \n<time>13:08</time> How the culture war manifests politically  \n<time>16:35</time> The contrast between Obama and Trump  \n<time>20:23</time> The divide between young women and young men  \n<time>22:59</time> Differences between Democrats and Republicans  \n<time>25:54</time> Attitudes toward experts and institutions  \n<time>29:19</time> The media  \n<time>32:41</time> Corporations  \n<time>34:53</time> The COVID-19 pandemic  \n<time>37:15</time> \u201cEverything is about politics, and politics is about everything\u201d  \n<time>38:44</time> Can the divide be solved?  \n<time>40:27</time> Follow Dr. Grossmann\u2019s work!\n\n---\n\nFollow Dr. Grossmann\u2019s work:  \nFaculty page: https://tinyurl.com/8ckwvm29  \nGoogle Scholar page: https://tinyurl.com/u99psmf8  \nPolarized by Degrees: https://tinyurl.com/td7b6tuc  \nX handle: @MattGrossmann\n",
