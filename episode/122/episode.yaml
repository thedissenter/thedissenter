  \ The History of a Dangerous Idea.\n\nIn this episode, we talk about the origins\
  \ of the economic idea of austerity, and its development over history. We also tackle\
  \ the notion of ordoliberalism, and how it connects with Germany, and how the European\
  \ Union was economically structured. How the 70\u2019s stagflation and the global\
  \ financial crisis of 2007/2008 changed the course of economics and politics. And\
  \ also what Dr. Blyth calls the phenomenon of Global Trumpism, and political populism\
  \ on both the right and the left. We finish up by talking a bit about current economic\
  \ issues, notably economic inequality in the West and global warming, and how to\
  \ deal with them.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:40  The origins of austerity  \n04:34  Ordoliberalism\
