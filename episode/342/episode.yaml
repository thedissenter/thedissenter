  \ the Department of Anthropology, and the Director of the Center for Behavior, Evolution\
  \ and Culture at UCLA. He is a biological anthropologist specializing in evolutionary\
  \ psychology, the study of the mind\u2019s evolved mechanisms and processes. In\

  \ Evolve.\n\nIn this episode, we focus on the topic of mental adaptations. We first\
  \ ask what a mental adaptation is. We also refer to modularity of mind, and talk\
  \ about domain-specific and domain-general modules. Toward the end, we discuss dual-systems\
  \ theory, and the role that consciousness plays in decision-making.\n\nTime Links:\

  \  Are all modules adaptations?  \n21:55  Domain-specific and domain-general modules\
  \  \n28:22  Are there really open-ended modules?  \n35:05  Is there a set of criteria\
  \ to classify something as an adaptation?  \n38:58  Does dual-systems theory have\
  \ any merit?  \n45:06  The role of consciousness  \n54:38  Follow Dr. Barrett\u2019\
