  \ Cognition at both the Faculty of Humanities and the Faculty of Science of the\
  \ University of Amsterdam (UvA). He conducts his research under the auspices of\
  \ the Institute for Logic, Language and Computation (ILLC) and the University of\
  \ Amsterdam's Brain and Cognition (ABC) Center. Dr. Honing is known as a passionate\
  \ researcher in this new interdisciplinary field that gives us fundamental insights\

  \ including Music Cognition: The Basics (2021, Routledge), The Evolving Animal Orchestra:\
  \ In Search of What Makes Us Musical (2019, The MIT Press)\u2013, and an edited\
  \ volume with a research agenda on musicality entitled The Origins of Musicality\
  \ (2018, The MIT Press).\n\nIn this episode, we talk about musicality. We start\
  \ with its cognitive components, and then go through: musicality in other animals;\
  \ the relationship between musicality and language; the evolutionary functions of\
  \ music; synchrony and social bonding; human universals in music; the neuroscience\
  \ of music; sexual selection; and if other animals appreciate music.\n\nTime Links:\
  \  \n00:00 Intro  \n00:49  What is musicality?  \n03:25  The cognitive components\
  \ of musicality  \n08:58  Musicality in other animals  \n17:17  Is there a relationship\
  \ between musicality and language?  \n21:45  The evolutionary functions of music\
  \  \n27:54  Synchrony and social bonding  \n30:54  Human universals in music  \n\
  35:34  Is how people estimate time related to musicality?  \n41:53  Is music localized\
  \ in the brain?  \n47:06  Was music sexually selected?  \n51:18  Do other animals\
  \ appreciate music?  \n56:34  Follow Dr. Honing\u2019s work!\n\n---\n\nFollow Dr.\
