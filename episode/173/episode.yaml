  \ talk about empathy, emotion regulation, and the unexpected relationship between\
  \ empathy and cruelty. First, we talk about the several cognitive and emotional\
  \ dimensions of empathy. Then, we discuss emotion regulation and how it relates\
  \ to empathy, as well as the developmental stages children go through when it comes\
  \ to emotion regulation. We also refer to the relationship between emotion regulation\
  \ and happiness, and the perils of focusing too much on happiness. Finally, we talk\
  \ about the relationship between empathy and cruelty.\n\nTime Links:  \n01:09  Empathy\
