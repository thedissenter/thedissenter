  \ in the Department of Political Science at Ohio State University. He previously\
  \ held faculty positions at Harvard University and the University of Illinois at\
  \ Urbana-Champaign. He is or has been on the Editorial Boards of five major journals\

  \ of 2016 he was a Visiting Fellow at the Nobel Institute in Oslo, Norway. Dr. Braumoeller\u2019\
  s research is in the areas of international security and computational social science.\
  \ His current research focus is on the relationship between international order\
  \ and international conflict. He is the author of The Great Powers and the International\
  \ System (winner of the 2014 International Studies Association Best Book Award and\
  \ the 2014 J. David Singer Book Award) and Only the Dead: The Persistence of War\
  \ in the Modern Age (Oxford University Press, 2019).\n\nIn this episode, we focus\
  \ on Only the Dead. We first address some basic questions, like the definition of\
  \ war, when war started in human history, and the causes of war and how they changed\
  \ over time. We talk about how to measure rates of conflict initiation, and magnitude,\
  \ severity and intensity of war. We then get into the decline-of-war thesis, particularly\
  \ the version put forth by Steven Pinker, and go through some of the main issues\
  \ with it, at the level of data and explanations. We also talk about what it gets\
  \ right. Finally, we ask if wars are irrational, and discuss why the decline-of-war\
  \ thesis might be politically dangerous.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro\
