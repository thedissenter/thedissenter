	"shownotes": "RECORDED ON DECEMBER 15th 2025.  \nRebecca Love is an adult film actress who has been in the industry since 1995. She furthered her career and had the opportunity to be in Erotica Films on HBO, Showtime and Cinemax. She is also the cofounder of \u201cAdult Film Star Network\u201d which educates people in the adult industry.\n\nIn this episode, we talk about how Rebecca got into pornography. We tackle assumptions people make about sex workers, negative attitudes toward sex and sex workers, what sex workers really need from society and politicians. We also discuss the behavior of hypocrites who say they are against sex work, patronizing attitudes toward sex workers, and how sex workers can be humanized. Finally, we talk about Rebecca\u2019s Adult Film Star Network, sex education and female sexual pleasure, and whether sex workers need any saving.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>01:00</time> How Rebecca got into porn  \n<time>09:35</time> Assumptions people make about sex workers  \n<time>18:14</time> Negative attitudes toward sex  \n<time>19:54</time> What do sex workers need from society and politicians?  \n<time>27:40</time> How porn changed over time  \n<time>33:03</time> Hypocrites who say they are against sex work  \n<time>37:27</time> Patronizing attitudes toward sex workers  \n<time>43:18</time> Humanizing sex workers  \n<time>44:49</time> The Adult Film Star Network  \n<time>50:06</time> Sex education and female sexual pleasure  \n<time>1:00:06</time> Do sex workers need any saving?  \n  Follow Rebecca\u2019s work!\n\n---\n\nFollow Rebecca\u2019s work:  \nWebsite: https://tinyurl.com/34mr5e3a  \nInstagram: @the_one2love  \nTwitter handle: @rebeccalovexxx  \nAdult Film Star Network: https://tinyurl.com/yjrz7k2p\n",
