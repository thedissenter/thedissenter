excerpt: Dr. Niels Dingemanse is Tenured Professor in Behavioural Ecology in the Department
  of Biology at the Ludwig Maximilians University, Germany. He conducts evolutionary
  behavioral ecology research, asking questions about the adaptive evolution of behavioral
  strategies, and their genetic architectures, within an ecological context. His research
  is motivated by behavioral ecology, life-history, and quantitative genetics theory,
  and seeks to test predictions and assumptions of adaptive theory using observational
  and experimental approaches in the laboratory and the wild.

  \ in Behavioural Ecology in the Department of Biology at the Ludwig Maximilians\
  \ University, Germany. He conducts evolutionary behavioral ecology research, asking\
  \ questions about the adaptive evolution of behavioral strategies, and their genetic\
  \ architectures, within an ecological context. His research is motivated by behavioral\
  \ ecology, life-history, and quantitative genetics theory, and seeks to test predictions\
  \ and assumptions of adaptive theory using observational and experimental approaches\
  \ in the laboratory and the wild.\n\nIn this episode, we focus on animal personality.\
  \ We discuss the relationship between ecology and evolutionary biology, the evolution\
  \ of behavioral traits, and behavioral plasticity. We then get into personality,\
  \ and go through its behavioral genetics, social roles, and ecological aspects individuals\
  \ respond to.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:59  The relationship between ecology and evolutionary\
