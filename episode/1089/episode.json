	"shownotes": "RECORDED ON FEBRUARY 26th 2025.  \nDr. Alexander Thomas is a Senior Lecturer in Media Production and Film at the University of East London. He is the author of The Politics and Ethics of Transhumanism: Techno-Human Evolution and Advanced Capitalism.\n\nIn this episode, we focus on The Politics and Ethics of Transhumanism. We start by discussing what transhumanism is, its tenets, different kinds of transhumanism, enhancement, hierarchy and elitism, and arguments against transhumanism. We delve into advanced capitalism, longtermism, accelerationism, effective altruism, TESCREALism, the politics of transhumanism, and eugenics. We also talk about data totalitarianism, the consequences of a cybernetic approach to the human mind, artificial general intelligence (AGI), and posthumanism. We discuss whether transhumanism can be a religious movement. Finally, we talk about the risk of dehumanization, and how we can ethically approach a potential transhuman future.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:30</time> What is transhumanism?  \n<time>10:36</time> The tenets of transhumanism  \n<time>15:32</time> Kinds of transhumanism  \n<time>17:15</time> Enhancement  \n<time>25:00</time> Hierarchy and elitism  \n<time>27:53</time> Arguments against transhumanism  \n<time>29:46</time> Advanced capitalism  \n<time>39:19</time> Longtermism, accelerationism, and effective altruism  \n<time>46:41</time> The politics of transhumanism  \n<time>50:16</time> TESCREALism  \n<time>55:11</time> Eugenics  \n<time>57:37</time> Data totalitarianism  \n<time>1:02:04</time> A cybernetics approach to the mind  \n<time>1:05:36</time> AGI  \n<time>1:07:57</time> Posthumanism  \n<time>1:11:17</time> A religious movement?  \n<time>1:14:54</time> Dehumanization  \n<time>1:20:53</time> How to approach a transhuman future  \n<time>1:23:30</time> Follow Dr. Thomas\u2019 work!\n\n---\n\nFollow Dr. Thomas\u2019 work:  \nFaculty page: https://tinyurl.com/3wmnpe46  \nThe Politics and Ehtics of Transhumanism: https://tinyurl.com/2rd2pykx\n",
