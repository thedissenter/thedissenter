	"shownotes": "RECORDED ON MAY 5th 2025.  \nDr. Cahal Moran is a Visiting Fellow at the London School of Economics and Political Science. He is interested in understanding the impact that behavioral heuristics and biases have on our decisions in the real world. He runs the popular YouTube channel Unlearning Economics. He is the author of Why We\u2019re Getting Poorer: A Realist\u2019s Guide to the Economy and How We Can Fix It.\n\nIn this episode, we focus on Why We\u2019re Getting Poorer. We start by talking about the 2008 economic crisis and the effects of austerity measures. We discuss what the economy is, and how wealth is created. We also discuss whether we need the capitalist class, who the essential workers are, the impact of billionaires in society and politics, and philanthropy. We then go through topics like social mobility, economic inequality, Universal Basic Income, how to measure poverty, the gender pay gap, the housing crisis, and inflation and the cost-of-living crisis. Finally, we talk about how we can make the world economy more resilient, and we discuss how we can fix our economic systems.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:33</time> The 2008 economic crisis and the use of austerity  \n<time>06:13</time> What is the economy?  \n<time>08:51</time> How is wealth created?  \n<time>11:03</time> Do we need the capitalist class?  \n<time>16:07</time> The German economy  \n<time>19:32</time> Who are the essential workers?  \n<time>23:34</time> The billionaires  \n<time>30:05</time> Philanthropy  \n<time>34:27</time> Social mobility  \n<time>42:08</time> The impact of economic inequality  \n<time>45:55</time> Universal Basic Income  \n<time>52:14</time> The optimists, and how to measure poverty  \n<time>1:09:06</time> The gender pay gap  \n<time>1:15:14</time> The housing crisis  \n<time>1:28:17</time> Inflation and the cost-of-living crisis  \n<time>1:32:03</time> Making the world economy more resilient  \n<time>1:39:55</time> How to fix our economic systems  \n<time>1:45:38</time> A final message  \n<time>1:48:25</time> Follow Dr. Moran\u2019s work!\n\n---\n\nFollow Dr. Moran\u2019s work:  \nUniversity page: https://tinyurl.com/ntrrbvzp  \nYouTube channel: @unlearningeconomics9021  \nWhy We\u2019re Getting Poorer: https://tinyurl.com/4dumb98h\n",
