  \ He also has a YouTube channel with his name.  \nThis is my third interview with\

  Philosophy of Music and Art\u201D: https://youtu.be/HUiV4Hgw924\n\nIn this episode,\
  \ we talk about aesthetic and artistic tastes and preferences, and their innate\
  \ and acquired aspects. We also refer to the issues with trying to find patterns\
  \ in music from different times and cultures that might be universal and biologically\
  \ based. \n\nTime Links:  \n01:12  Are aesthetic and artistic preferences innate\
  \ or acquired?  \n04:09  Biological and physiological constraints              \
  \             \n09:08  The relationship between musical sounds and natural sounds\
  \        \n13:51  Is there a \u201Csavannah hypothesis\u201D for the evolutionary\
  \ bases of music?                \n18:38  Social influences              \n28:54\
  \  The issues with finding patterns of musical tastes in different times and cultures\

  \ as \u201Cugly\u201D or \u201Cbeautiful\u201D               \n52:20  As an artist,\
  \ is there peer pressure to conform to certain standards?  \n\n---\n\nFollow Mr.\
