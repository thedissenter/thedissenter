excerpt: "Dr. Daniel Sznycer is Assistant Professor in Department of Psychology at\
  \ the University of Montreal, Canada. He is an evolutionary social psychologist\
  \ conducting research on emotion and cooperation. He has multiple lines of cross-cultural\
  \ evidence on shame, pride, compassion, and envy, and their roles in altruism, cooperation,\
  \ social exclusion, and conflict. He\u2019s also working to map the system that\
  \ regulates how much weight one individual places on the welfare of another. He\
  \ conducts research on how these emotions and motivations regulate political and\
  \ moral attitudes, and how they shape communication. The methods Dr. Sznycer uses\
  \ include experimental economic games, decision-making tasks, priming methods, cross-cultural\
  \ and ethnographic data collection, large-scale representative surveys, and anthropometry."

  \nIn this episode, we talk about the evolutionary psychology of emotions. First,\
  \ Dr. Sznycer explains what are emotions from an evolutionary perspective, and how\
  \ we can square off their universality with their cross-cultural variation. I also\
  \ ask him if there\u2019s a set of basic emotions. He then tells us about the common\
  \ grammar of social valuation that virtually all human beings share.  \n\nTime Links:\
