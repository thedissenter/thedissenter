shownotes: "RECORDED ON NOVEMBER 2nd 2021.  \nDr. Marianna Ganapini is an Assistant\
  \ Professor in the Philosophy Department at Union College (NY). She works primarily\
  \ in contemporary philosophy of mind and epistemology. She also has related interests\
  \ in the ethics and epistemology of AI.\n\nIn this episode, we talk about beliefs,\
  \ confabulations, fake news, and AI. We start with beliefs, what they are, and the\
  \ different approaches in philosophy of mind to try to understand how they work.\
  \ We get into the concept of belief\u2019s minimal rationality. We discuss the social\
  \ functions of beliefs. We go through post-hoc rationalizations and confabulations.\
  \ We try to understand why we confabulate. We ask why we can\u2019t deliberately\
  \ believe what we want. We get a bit into why people share fake stories online,\
  \ and the several reasons and motivations behind it. We discuss if it makes sense\
  \ to ask if people are rational or irrational. Finally, we talk a bit about the\
  \ implications of AI systems potentially developing some of the psychological abilities\
  \ we explore in this talk.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:00 Intro  \n00:39  What is belief?\
