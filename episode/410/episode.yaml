  \ The Eternal Decline and Fall of Rome: The History of a Dangerous Idea.\n\nIn this\
  \ episode, we focus on Mortal Republic. We go through the several different political\
  \ organizations that Rome had \u2013 the kingdom, the republic, and the empire -,\
  \ and some of their major players, like the patricians, the Gracchi brothers (Tiberius\
  \ and Gaius), and Julius Caesar. We then ask if there are any lessons we can take\
  \ from the Roman Republic for modern politics, Great-Man vs. Great-Ideas theories\
  \ of History, and if History really does repeat itself.\n\nTime Links:  \n01:05\
