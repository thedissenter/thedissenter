shownotes: "RECORDED ON JULY 26th 2021.  \nDr. Orestis Palermos is Lecturer in the\
  \ School of English, Communication and Philosophy at Cardiff University. He works\
  \ at the intersection of philosophy of mind and cognitive science, epistemology,\
  \ philosophy of science and philosophy of technology. He is interested in the idea\
  \ of philosophical engineering: the way philosophy can impact the design of emerging\
  \ technologies and socio-technical systems.\n\nIn this episode, we talk about epistemology,\
  \ philosophy of mind, and philosophy of technology. We distinguish between internalism\
  \ and externalism in epistemology, and then talk about extended and distributed\
  \ cognition. We talk about social epistemology, and different kinds of technologies\
  \ that allow for extended cognition. We ask if students should be allowed to use\
  \ Google in their exams. We discuss how we should think about culture in terms of\
  \ epistemology. We discuss how science works. Finally, we talk about philosophical\
  \ engineering.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:00  Intro  \n00:42  Internalism and externalism\
