	"shownotes": "RECORDED ON MAY 28th 2024.  \nDr. Robert Welshon is a Professor in the Philosophy department at the University of Colorado, Colorado Springs. His areas of specialization are philosophy of mind, philosophy of neuroscience, and the work of Friedrich Nietzsche. He is a past Fulbright Fellow (2008-2009) and Visiting Professor at Brown (1997). He is the author of numerous books, the latest one being Nietzsche's On The Genealogy of Morality: A Guide.\n\nIn this episode, we focus on Nietzsche's On The Genealogy of Morality. We first discuss what Nietzsche intended with a revaluation of moral values, what the genealogical method is, and philosophical naturalism. We discuss where other philosophers and theologians failed in their approaches to moral psychology, before getting into essay I of Genealogy, regarding the impact of ressentiment on Christian moral evaluation. We discuss master and slave morality, and the phenomenon of ressentiment. We then explore essay II, on the moral psychology of conscience and guilt, and essay III, on the meaning of the ascetic ideal. We talk about ascetic values in artists, philosophers, and scientists. Finally, we discuss the merits and shortcomings of Genealogy.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:38</time> A guide to Genealogy of Morality  \n<time>07:30</time> A revaluation of values  \n<time>11:57</time> The genealogical method  \n<time>14:08</time> Philosophical naturalism  \n<time>21:30</time> Where other philosophers and theologians failed  \n<time>29:05</time> Essay I: the impact of ressentiment on Christian moral evaluation  \n<time>37:33</time> Masters, slaves, and ressentiment  \n<time>54:46</time> Essay II: the moral psychology of conscience and guilt  \n<time>1:23:20</time> Essay III: the ascetic ideal  \n<time>1:36:11</time> Ascetic values in artists, philosophers, and scientists  \n<time>1:45:54</time> The merits and shortcomings of Genealogy  \n<time>1:52:58</time> Follow Dr. Welshon\u2019s work!\n\n---\n\nFollow Dr. Welshon\u2019s work:  \nFaculty page: https://bit.ly/41WsPSG  \nNietzsche's On The Genealogy of Morality: https://tinyurl.com/mu99jht2\n",
