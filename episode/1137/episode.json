He is the author of Law Is a Moral Practice.\n\nIn this episode, we focus on Law Is a Moral Practice. We start by talking about rules, law, and morality. We discuss how laws are developed, and whether law and morality are separate things. We talk about law as a moral practice, what lawyers argue about, natural law, and how the law is constituted by different sets of norms. Finally, we discuss whether people are obligated to obey the law, what kind of work lawyers do, and why sometimes people find lawyers repugnant.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:26</time> Rules, law, and morality  \n<time>05:44</time> How are laws developed?  \n<time>11:37</time> Are law and morality separate things?  \n<time>15:52</time> Law as a moral practice  \n<time>20:41</time> What do lawyers argue about?  \n<time>30:57</time> Natural law  \n<time>34:36</time> The law is constituted by different sets of norms  \n<time>39:35</time> Are people obligated to obey the law?  \n<time>48:48</time> What kind of work do lawyers do?  \n<time>52:03</time> Why sometimes people find lawyers repugnant  \n<time>54:28</time> Follow Dr. Hershovitz\u2019s work!\n\n---\n\nFollow Dr. Hershovitz\u2019s work:  \nFaculty page: https://tinyurl.com/3cfym3zv  \nWebsite: https://tinyurl.com/yekna2f5  \nPhilPeople profile: https://tinyurl.com/kcd5ne96  \nLaw Is a Moral Practice: https://tinyurl.com/4rbyek88  \nTwitter handle: @shershovitz\n",
