shownotes: "RECORDED ON FEBRUARY 22nd 2022.  \nDr. Robert Pennock is University Distinguished\
  \ Professor at Michigan State University, where he is on the faculty of Lyman Briggs\
  \ College, the Departments of Philosophy and Computer Science & Engineering, and\
  \ the Ecology, Evolution and Behavior program. His research involves empirical and\
  \ philosophical questions that relate to evolutionary biology, cognitive science,\
  \ and the scientific character, such as the evolution of altruism, complexity, and\
  \ intelligence. He is the author of books like An Instinct for Truth: Curiosity\
  \ and the Moral Character of Science.\n\nIn this episode, we focus on An Instinct\
  \ for Truth. We go through some of the traits that characterize (or should characterize)\
  \ scientists, like curiosity, honesty, skepticism, and intellectual humility. We\
  \ talk about moral values that orient science, and the importance of failure. We\
  \ discuss the scientific method, the demarcation problem, and pseudoscience. We\
  \ talk about the relationship between science and ethics. Finally, we ask if science\
  \ is a cultural construct.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:00 Intro  \n00:51  The traits of\
  \ a scientist  \n05:43  Are we innately predisposed to science?  \n08:22  Curiosity\
  \  \n09:48  Is there a set of moral values that orient science?  \n13:50  Are virtues\
  \ inherent to scientists or derived from their social milieu?  \n19:27  Honesty\
  \  \n23:59  Skepticism  \n29:26  Intellectual humility  \n32:10  The importance\
  \ of failure  \n34:31  The scientific method, and the demarcation problem  \n45:16\
