	"shownotes": "RECORDED ON JUNE 5th 2025.  \nAdam Bode is an interdisciplinary romantic love and human mating researcher who employs an ethological framework in his theory and analysis. He has a Bachelor of Psychology (Honours) and a Bachelor of Laws from the Australian National University. He is currently enrolled in a PhD in Biological Anthropology at the Australian National University\u2019s School of Archaeology and Anthropology and holds a position as a Sessional Academic at Federation University Australia in the Institute of Health and Wellbeing. Adam\u2019s research investigates romantic love using methods and approaches from biological anthropology, human ethology, and psychology. Adam is a proponent of a new approach to the science of romantic love which takes a broad definition of romantic love, uses an ethological framework, and suggests it evolved by co-opting mother-infant bonding.\n\nIn this episode, we talk about romantic love. We start by discussing what it is, an interdisciplinary approach to love, and whether it is a human universal. We then go through Tinbergen\u2019s 4 questions applied to romantic love. We discuss whether romantic love is an evolved adaptation, the evolutionary history of romantic love, and Adam\u2019s hypothesis that romantic love evolved by co-opting mother-infant bonding. Finally, we talk about mating systems, and the link between romantic love and sexual activity.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:48</time> What is romantic love?  \n<time>06:24</time> An interdisciplinary approach to love  \n<time>09:45</time> Is romantic love a human universal?  \n<time>14:08</time> Applying Tinbergen\u2019s 4 questions to romantic love  \n<time>22:04</time> Is romantic love an evolved adaptation?  \n<time>25:24</time> The evolutionary history of romantic love  \n<time>41:08</time> The hypothesis that romantic love evolved by co-opting mother-infant bonding  \n<time>47:11</time> Mating systems  \n<time>54:09</time> Does romantic love lead to increased sexual activity?  \n<time>55:16</time> Final remarks  \n<time>56:08</time> Follow Adam\u2019s work!\n\n---\n\nFollow Dr. Adam\u2019s work:  \nUniversity page: https://tinyurl.com/3h3h7utd  \nWebsite: https://adambode.net/  \nResearchGate profile: https://tinyurl.com/49sn3vsp  \nX handle: @AdamBode4\n",
