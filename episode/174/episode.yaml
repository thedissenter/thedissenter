  \ interplay between biology and culture in explaining large-scale human cooperation,\
  \ and the biological bases of human culture. We then refer to the Cultural Brain\
  \ Hypothesis, the relationship between individual-level psychology and group-level\
  \ traits, genetic and cultural evolution, and contentious topic of group selection.\
  \ Finally, we talk about prosocial institutions, and political corruption and how\
  \ societies might promote it and also common strategies to fight it that might backfire.\n\
