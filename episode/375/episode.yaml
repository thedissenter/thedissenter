  \ professor of anthropology (adjunct) at the University of Colorado, Colorado Springs\
  \ (UCCS) Center for Cognitive Archaeology. She recently completed two years of postdoctoral\
  \ research at the University of Bergen (MSCA individual fellowship, EU project 785793).\

  \ philosophy, English) from UCCS. She\u2019s the editor of Squeezing Minds From\
  \ Stones: Cognitive Archaeology and the Evolution of the Human Mind.\n\nIn this\
  \ episode, we talk about cognitive archaeology. First, we go through some basics,\
  \ and ask what are archaeological remnants, and where archaeology starts in our\
  \ evolutionary history, and we also talk about cumulative culture, and the discipline\
  \ of cognitive archaeology. We discuss if modern hunter-gatherers make for good\
  \ models of ancient peoples, and what we can learn about cognition from ancient\
  \ artifacts. We ask if technology expands our cognitive capacities, and the get\
  \ into more specific topics, like the relationship between tool-making and tool-use\
  \ and conceptualization, and language. We also talk about numeracy and literacy.\
