shownotes: "Dr. Carlton Patrick is Assistant Professor of Legal Studies at the College\
  \ of Community, Innovation and Education at the University of Central Florida. Dr.\
  \ Patrick studies the psychology of legal decision-making, often from an evolutionary\
  \ perspective. His research combines doctrinal legal analysis with the methodologies\
  \ and perspectives of the behavioral sciences to examine the roots of human behavior\
  \ in legally-relevant contexts. He is the coauthor, together with Debra Lieberman,\
  \ of the book Objection: Disgust, Morality, and the Law.\n\nThis is the second episode\
  \ where I talk about the book Objection: Disgust Morality, and the Law. The first\
  \ one was with the other coauthor, Dr. Debra Lieberman (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7KCXBPvRlg).\
  \   \nIn this episode, we talk about the legal aspects of the book. First, Dr. Patrick\
  \ tells us about his take of the evolved domains of disgust \u2013 pathogen, sexual,\
  \ and moral. We then talk about how we formulate laws based on disgust, or how we\
  \ go from \u201Cgross\u201D to \u201Cwrong\u201D. We also discuss the important\
  \ distinction between laws and social norms. We get into the very contentious discussion\
  \ about if legal systems are moral. Dr. Patrick gives a few examples of legal areas\
  \ that are influenced by disgust, like obscenity and sexual relationships. We finally\
  \ explore if disgust should be used as a criterion to create laws, and also if jurors\
  \ and judges should be exposed to evidential material that triggers disgust. \n\n\
