	"shownotes": "RECORDED ON JUNE 13th 2025.  \nDr. Brad Duchaine is a Professor in the Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences at Dartmouth College. He uses neuropsychology, psychophysics, and neuroimaging to explore the cognitive, neural, developmental, and genetic basis of social perception. Much of his work focuses on prosopagnosia, a condition defined by severe face recognition deficits.\n\nIn this episode, we first talk about face perception and face perception ability. We then discuss prosopagnosia: what it is, what causes it, its psychosocial impact, the link between loneliness and social perception, how it affects face memory, and whether it can be improved. We then delve into prosopometamorphopsia: what it is, what causes it, stimulus manipulations that improve it, and how it relates to color perception. Finally, we discuss what we can learn more about how face perception and representation work by studying conditions like prosopagnosia and prosopometamorphopsia.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:48</time> Face perception  \n<time>06:39</time> Face recognition ability  \n<time>09:02</time> Prosopagnosia  \n<time>15:12</time> The psychosocial impact of prosopagnosia  \n<time>22:10</time> Social perception and loneliness  \n<time>23:27</time> Face memory  \n<time>25:56</time> Can prosopagnosia be improved?  \n<time>26:48</time> Prosopometamorphopsia  \n<time>42:09</time> What can we learn more about how face perception and representation work by studying conditions like prosopagnosia and prosopometamorphopsia?  \n<time>45:18</time> Follow Dr. Duchaine\u2019s work!\n\n---\n\nFollow Dr. Duchaine\u2019s work:  \nFaculty page: https://bit.ly/3O4b8ed  \nSocial Perception Lab: https://bit.ly/3vxvIgG  \nResearchGate profile: http://tinyurl.com/c4bcyf4a\n",
