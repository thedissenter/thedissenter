	"shownotes": "RECORDED ON OCTOBER 29th 2024.  \nDr. Tha\u00eds Pansani is an Associate Researcher at the Smithsonian Museum of Natural History. Her main research questions are about human interaction with the Pleistocene megafauna in the Americas and the peopling of the Americas. She is interested in questions like: When did humans arrive in the Americas? Did humans interact with the Pleistocene megafauna? What were the environmental and ecological conditions in which these megamammals lived? What were the causes and consequences of the megafauna extinction in the American continent, especially in South America? How can we identify traces of human interaction in extinct animal bones through taphonomy and zooarchaeology?\n\nIn this episode, we focus on H. sapiens\u2019 migrations to (and within) the Americas. We discuss the timing of the migrations, whether we were the only hominin species to get there, and why we migrate. We then talk about megafauna in the Americas; interactions between humans and megafauna (with a focus on hunting); zooarchaeology, and the study of marks on animal bones; and the extinction of megafauna might have been the result of human activity. Finally, we discuss some of the most interesting unanswered questions in paleoanthropology.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:52</time> Humans\u2019 arrival and migrations in the Americas  \n<time>11:45</time> Were we the only hominin species to get to the Americas?  \n<time>21:13</time> Why do humans migrate?  \n<time>24:37</time> Megafauna in the Americas  \n<time>36:23</time> Interactions between humans and megafauna  \n<time>42:19</time> Zooarchaeology, and the study of marks on animal bones  \n<time>55:00</time> Human activity and the extinction of megafauna  \n<time>1:04:50</time> Unanswered questions about the Americas  \n<time>1:09:33</time> Follow Dr. Pansani\u2019s work!\n\n---\n\nFollow Dr. Pansani\u2019s work:  \nSmithsonian page: https://tinyurl.com/47kn2fwz  \nWebsite: https://www.thaispansani.com/  \nResearchGate profile: https://tinyurl.com/348d659d  \nTwitter handle: @thaisrpansani\n",
