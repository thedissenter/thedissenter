	"shownotes": "RECORDED ON APRIL 7th 2025.  \nDr. Angela Potochnik is Professor of Philosophy and Director of the Center for Public Engagement with Science at the University of Cincinnati. Her research addresses the nature of science and its successes, the relationships between science and the public, and methods in science, especially population biology. She is the author of Idealization and the Aims of Science, and coauthor of Recipes for Science: An Introduction to Scientific Methods and Reasoning.\n\nIn this episode, we focus on Recipes for Science. We start by discussing why we should care about science, the limits of science, the demarcation problem, whether there is one single scientific method, and hypotheses and theories. We also talk about experimentation and non-experimental methods, scientific modeling, scientific reasoning, statistics and probability, correlation and causation, explanation in science, and scientific breakthroughs. Finally, we talk about how the social and historical context influences science, and we discuss whether science can ever be value-free.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:29</time> Why should we care about science?  \n<time>05:54</time> The limits of science  \n<time>07:41</time> The demarcation problem  \n<time>10:29</time> Is there one single scientific method?  \n<time>12:51</time> Hypotheses and theories  \n<time>14:47</time> Experimentation  \n<time>19:20</time> Scientific models  \n<time>26:36</time> Scientific reasoning  \n<time>38:51</time> Correlation and causation  \n<time>42:49</time> Explanation in science  \n<time>46:46</time> Scientific breakthroughs  \n<time>50:52</time> The social and historical context  \n<time>57:22</time> Can science be value-free?  \n<time>1:00:27</time> Follow Dr. Potochnik\u2019s work!\n\n---\n\nFollow Dr. Potochnik\u2019s work:  \nFaculty page: https://tinyurl.com/3w98ykpc  \nWebsite: https://tinyurl.com/2zhdee5s  \nPhilPeople profile: https://tinyurl.com/bdc4zkev  \nRecipes for Science: https://tinyurl.com/5n8766nx  \nScientific American article: https://tinyurl.com/4cesy7rf\n",
