  \ His new book is How Children Invented Humanity: The Role of Development in Human\
  \ Evolution.\n\nIn this episode, we focus on How Children Invented Humanity. We\
  \ discuss the relationship between evolution and development. We explore our extended\
  \ period of development, and what distinguishes it from other species. We talk about\
  \ behavioral plasticity, neoteny, behavioral genetics, innateness, and individual\
  \ differences. We discuss play, and its importance for child development. We talk\
  \ about what Piaget got right and what he got wrong, and the issues with thinking\
  \ about development in stages. We ask what the relationship between development\
  \ and the evolution of culture is. We talk about the importance of mothers in our\
  \ evolution. We explore some sex differences in human development, attachment theory,\
  \ and our most distinct social traits. Finally, we discuss some sources of evolutionary\
  \ mismatch in modern societies, like social media, hyper-individualism, and formal\
  \ educational practices, and what we can learn from hunter-gatherers. We also mention\
  \ the negative psychological effects the covid-19 pandemic might be having on children.\n\
