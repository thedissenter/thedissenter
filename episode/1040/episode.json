	"shownotes": "RECORDED ON MAY 7th 2024.  \nDr. Luana Colloca is Professor in Pain and Translational Symptom Science, Director of the Placebo Beyond Opinions Center, MPower Professor, and Adjunct Professor in the Department of Anesthesiology (School of Medicine) at the University of Maryland, Baltimore. She is co-editor of Placebo Effects Through the Lens of Translational Research.\n\nIn this episode, we focus on Placebo Effects Through the Lens of Translational Research. We start by discussing what a placebo is, how placebos work, and the goals of the book. We talk about placebo-based clinical interventions, expectations and culture in a clinical context, individual variation in the placebo effect, and we explore the example of the placebo effect in alcohol use disorder. We discuss when a placebo effect becomes a treatment effect, the patient-clinician relationship, and whether psychotherapy is an open-label placebo. Finally, we discuss why placebos matter for research quality.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:41</time> What is a placebo?  \n<time>02:32</time> How placebos work  \n<time>07:26</time> The goals of the book  \n<time>11:07</time> Placebo-based clinical interventions  \n<time>14:46</time> Expectations and culture in a clinical context  \n<time>21:30</time> Individual variation in the placebo effect  \n<time>29:40</time> The placebo effect in alcohol use disorder  \n<time>32:16</time> When does a placebo effect become a treatment effect?  \n<time>33:49</time> Patient-clinician relationship  \n<time>35:48</time> Is psychotherapy an open-label placebo  \n<time>40:48</time> Why placebos matter for research quality  \n<time>43:34</time> Follow Dr. Colloca\u2019s work!\n\n---\n\nFollow Dr. Colloca\u2019s work:  \nFaculty page: https://bit.ly/3HhI2UH  \nWebsite: https://bit.ly/3Hjgazv  \nPlacebo Beyond Opinions Center: https://tinyurl.com/3kxkbe9y  \nResearchGate profile: http://tinyurl.com/mm9mv67d  \nPlacebo Effects Through the Lens of Translational Research: https://tinyurl.com/3tpcc7h2\n",
