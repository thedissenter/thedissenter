	"shownotes": "RECORDED ON JULY 17th 2025.  \nDr. Jason Clarke is Lecturer in Psychology in the School of Human and Social Sciences at the University of West London. He is a cognitive scientist whose research focuses on revealing the psychological and neural processes underlying visual perception, memory, and consciousness. He is the author of Constructing Experience: Expectation and Attention in Perception.\n\nIn this episode, we focus on Constructing Experience. We talk about the brain as a prediction machine, and the generative model. We go through consciousness, perception, attention, and whether expectation can shape perception. We discuss whether attention is necessary for all kinds of conscious experiences. Finally, we talk about implications of this kind of research, including implications for scientific theories of consciousness, and clinical implications, in terms of how we understand hallucinations and schizophrenia.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:39</time> The brain as a predictive machine  \n<time>07:18</time> The generative model  \n<time>10:03</time> Consciousness  \n<time>19:48</time> Perception  \n<time>34:39</time> Attention  \n<time>46:03</time> Can expectation shape perception?  \n<time>1:04:38</time> Is attention necessary for all kinds of conscious experiences?  \n<time>1:09:52</time> Implications for scientific theories of consciousness  \n<time>1:11:57</time> Clinical implications: hallucinations and schizophrenia  \n<time>1:15:59</time> Follow Dr. Clarke\u2019s work!\n\n---\n\nFollow Dr. Clarke\u2019s work:  \nFaculty page: https://tinyurl.com/bdjepp2a  \nResearchGate profile: https://tinyurl.com/yc867b8t  \nConstructing Experience: https://tinyurl.com/33fmet9s\n",
