	"shownotes": "RECORDED ON JANUARY 29th 2024.  \nDr. Olivia Reilly is a Postdoctoral Fellow in the Hecht Lab at Harvard University. Dr. Reilly earned her B.A. in Animal Behavior and Spanish from Bucknell University. She spent two years in the postbaccalaureate IRTA program in the Laboratory of Brain and Cognition at the National Institute of Mental Health prior to graduate school. Dr. Reilly completed her M.A. and Ph.D. in Cognitive Sciences at Georgia State University where she studied social cognition in nonhuman primates at the Language Research Center. As a postdoctoral fellow in the Hecht Lab, she uses a comparative approach to investigate the neural and hormonal correlates of social cognition and behavior.\n\nIn this episode, we talk about social cognition in primates, with a focus on capuchin monkeys. We talk about affiliative behaviors and the role of oxytocin in capuchin monkeys, and we talk specifically about fur-rubbing behavior. We then get into sex differences in the brains of capuchin monkeys, the factors that might play a role in them, and how they compare to sex differences in the brains of humans. We also talk about Dr. Reilly\u2019s current projects, involving capuchin monkeys, and also dogs and human children.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:46</time> Studying social cognition in primates  \n<time>05:39</time> Affiliative behaviors and the role of oxytocin in capuchin monkeys  \n<time>09:54</time> Fur-rubbing behavior  \n<time>12:46</time> Sex differences in the brains of capuchin monkeys  \n<time>21:36</time> Sex differences in human brains compared to capuchin monkeys  \n<time>37:54</time> Dr. Reilly\u2019s current projects  \n<time>42:04</time> Follow Dr. Reilly\u2019s work!\n\n---\n\nFollow Dr. Reilly\u2019s work:  \nEvolutionary Neuroscience Lab: https://bit.ly/3vSgNhh  \nResearchGate profile: https://bit.ly/458z3yC  \nTwitter handle: @OliviaTReilly\n",
