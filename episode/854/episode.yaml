  \ Professor of the History of Science and Affiliated Professor of Earth and Planetary\
  \ Sciences at Harvard University. A world-renowned earth scientist, historian and\
  \ public speaker, she is the author of the best-selling book, Merchants of Doubt\

  \ Oreskes is author or co-author of 9 books, the latest one being The Big Myth:\
  \ How American Business Taught Us to Loathe Government and Love the Free Market.\n\
  \nIn this episode, we focus on The Big Myth. We start by discussing the premise\
  \ of the book, and how it ties to Merchants of Doubt. We talk about the ideology\
  \ of \u201Cfree market fundamentalism\u201D, and how it was sold and went mainstream,\
  \ including a tripod of freedom, and campaigns to rewrite textbooks. We discuss\
  \ the rise of neoliberalism, the changes it brought, and its most severe social\
  \ and economic effects, including the return of child labor in the US. Finally,\
  \ we discuss if these are inevitable effects of capitalism, and what scientists\
  \ and science communicators can learn from the book.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:00  Intro\
