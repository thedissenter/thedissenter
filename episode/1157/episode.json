We talk about the premise of the book, what a philosophy for girls is and why it matters, the difference between sex and gender, the issue of under-representation of women in philosophy, and the gender gap in academic philosophy. We also discuss whether the way philosophy is done is gendered, the topics of the book, whether women can be empowered through philosophy, and how the gender gap can be addressed.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:49</time> The premise of the book.  \n<time>05:15</time> What is a philosophy for girls?  \n<time>15:11</time> Sex and gender  \n<time>24:28</time> The under-representation of women in philosophy  \n<time>27:13</time> The gender gap in academic philosophy  \n<time>37:06</time> Is the way philosophy is done gendered?  \n<time>44:59</time> The topics of the book  \n<time>50:08</time> Can women be empowered through philosophy?  \n<time>58:56</time> Addressing the gender gap in philosophy  \n<time>1:12:37</time> A philosophy book with nearly all sources written by women  \n<time>1:17:54</time> Follow Drs.
