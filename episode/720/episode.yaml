excerpt: 'Dr. Patrick McNamara is an Associate Professor of Neurology in the Department
  of Neurology at the BU School of Medicine and Professor of Psychology at National
  University, and Director of the Cognitive Neuroscience of Religion Project, along
  with Dr. Jordan Grafman. Upon graduating from the Behavioral Neuroscience Program
  at Boston University in 1991, he trained at the Aphasia Research Center at the Boston
  VA Medical Center in neurolinguistics and brain-cognitive correlation techniques.
  He then began developing an evolutionary approach to problems of brain and behavior
  and currently is studying the evolution of the frontal lobes, the evolution of the
  two mammalian sleep states (REM and NREM) and the evolution of religion in human
  cultures. He is the author of The Cognitive Neuroscience of Religious Experience:
  Decentering and the Self.'

  \ the study of religion, the evolution of religion, its role in gene-culture coevolution,\
  \ and religion as a transformational technology. We then go through decentering,\
  \ the divided self, the cognitive mechanisms and brain conditions that give rise\
  \ to religiosity, psychedelics, mystical experiences, supernatural agents, rituals,\
  \ and the relationship between language and religion.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:00 Intro\
