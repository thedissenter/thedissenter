	"shownotes": "RECORDED ON OCTOBER 1st 2025.  \nDr. Walter Veit is a Lecturer (Assistant Professor) in Philosophy at the University of Reading, where he is also the director of the PPE program as well as the philosophy MA program. His interests are broad, but he works primarily in and at the intersections of (i) the Philosophy of Cognitive and Biological Sciences, (ii) the Philosophy of Mind, and (iii) Applied Ethics. Much of his recent writing has been on animal minds, welfare, and ethics, as well as evolution. He is the author of A Philosophy for the Science of Animal Consciousness.\n\nIn this episode, we focus on A Philosophy for the Science of Animal Consciousness. We talk about what the science of consciousness is lacking, and a Darwinian approach to consciousness. We discuss phenomenological complexity, and how we can explore the phenomenology of other animals. We discuss whether the hard problem of consciousness can be solved by science. We talk about the example of gastropods, and the challenge of arthropods. We discuss whether any current theory of consciousness is right. Finally, we talk about biopsychism.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:33</time> The premise of the book  \n<time>03:54</time> What the science of consciousness is lacking  \n<time>06:09</time> A Darwinian approach to consciousness  \n<time>16:02</time> Phenomenological complexity  \n<time>19:52</time> How can explore the phenomenology of other animals?  \n<time>32:48</time> The hard problem of consciousness  \n<time>40:21</time> A thought experiment  \n<time>48:40</time> The example of gastropods, and the challenge of arthropods  \n<time>54:28</time> Is any current theory of consciousness right?  \n<time>1:02:33</time> Biopsychism  \n<time>1:07:42</time> Follow Dr. Veit\u2019s work!\n\n---\n\nFollow Dr. Veit\u2019s work:  \nFaculty page: https://bit.ly/3GVkt3X  \nWebsite: https://bit.ly/427A1eH  \nPhilPeople page: https://bit.ly/3txIPh9  \nA Philosophy for the Science of Animal Consciousness: https://bit.ly/427A4an  \nTwitter handle: @wrwveit\n",
