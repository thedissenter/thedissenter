  \ culture of know-how.\n\nIn this episode, we talk about tool behaviors, and culture.\
  \ We start with tool behaviors in apes, including flaked stone tools in orangutans\
  \ and chimpanzees, and food cleaning in gorillas. We talk about what might have\
  \ been the tool behaviors of early hominins. We discuss what we can learn by studying\
  \ chimpanzees in captivity, and the psychological mechanisms that underly the acquisition\
  \ of tool behaviors. We talk about children spontaneously inventing tool use behaviors,\
  \ and cultural behaviors that do not need cultural transmission. We ask if human\
  \ cognition is unique, and get into high-fidelity social learning and over-imitation.\
  \ We talk about cumulative culture, the role teaching and curiosity play in it,\
  \ and what distinguishes human culture from chimpanzee culture. Finally, we discuss\
  \ if science can be understood from a cultural evolutionary perspective.\n\nTime\
