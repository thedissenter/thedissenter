  \ in the Philosophy Department of the University of Toronto, and also a Humboldt\
  \ Research Fellow at the Humboldt University in Berlin. His primary research interests\
  \ are metaphysics and its history (mainly in German philosophy). His first book,\
  \ Kant\u2019s Modal Metaphysics, was published by Oxford University Press in 2016.\
  \ While most of Dr. Stang\u2019s published work has been about Kant, he is increasingly\
  \ interested in pre-Kantian rationalism (Leibniz, Spinoza) and in post-Kantian figures,\
  \ especially Hegel and Heidegger. He also works on contemporary metaphysics and\
  \ aesthetics. His side interests include: Jewish philosophy, early analytic philosophy,\
  \ philosophy of mathematics, and critical theory.\n\nIn this episode, we focus on\
  \ Kantian philosophy, particularly on his metaphysics, epistemology and ethics.\
  \ We start by presenting what metaphysics is, and the sorts of questions it deals\
  \ with. We also talk about how modern metaphysics positions itself in relation to\
  \ science and Physics, referring on the way to the epistemological limits of a materialist\
  \ approach. Then we get into Kant\u2019s metaphysics, and explore concepts like\
  \ the noumenon and the phenomenon. After that, we move to his epistemology, and\
  \ discuss sensibility, the categories of understanding, and pure Reason with its\
  \ antinomies. Finally, we go through Kantian ethics, and the necessity of a God,\
  \ a soul and free will. We also address the metaphysical status of moral laws, and\
  \ the is-ought gap from a Kantian perspective.\n\nTime Links:  \n01:03  What is\
  \ metaphysics?  \n14:17  About possible entities  \n16:54  Can we derive metaphysics\
  \ from Physics?  \n24:33  The limits of the scientific materialist approach  \n\
  36:29  Kantian metaphysics, and the noumenon and the phenomenon  \n52:28  According\
  \ to Kant, can we know what reality is? (Kant\u2019s epistemology, sensibility,\
  \ and the categories of understanding)  \n1:07:26  Pure reason, and the antinomies\
  \ of reason (the Universe, God, and free will)  \n1:32:31  Kantian ethics, and practical\
  \ reason (God, the soul, and free will)  \n1:56:29  The metaphysical status of moral\
  \ laws, the is-ought gap, and Hegel  \n2:14:53  Follow Dr. Stang\u2019s work!\n\n\
