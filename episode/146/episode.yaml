excerpt: Dr. Peggy Mason is a Professor in the Department of Neurobiology at the University
  of Chicago. She received both her BA in Biology and her Phd in Neuroscience from
  Harvard. Professor Mason has been on the faculty of University of Chicago since
  1992. She has taught undergraduate, graduate and medical students and has received
  numerous teaching awards. Using her nearly 15 years of experience teaching medical
  students, Professor Mason wrote a single-author textbook designed for medical students
  (Medical Neurobiology, Oxford University Press, 2017). Professor Mason's research
  focuses on the neurobiological basis of empathy and helping.

  \nIn this episode, we talk about empathy and helping behavior in humans and other\
  \ animal models, namely rats. We discuss first how empathy might have evolved, and\
  \ the neurobiological bases of it, including the roles played by the amygdala, the\
  \ hypothalamus, the prefrontal cortex and the temporo-parietal junction. We also\
  \ talk about the flaws with the research surrounding mirror neurons. Then, we talk\
  \ about the situations that invoke empathy. We also refer to Paul Bloom\u2019s book,\
  \ Against Empathy, and the difference between emotional empathy and cognitive empathy,\
  \ and between empathy and compassion. We also briefly refer to how empathy might\
  \ work in psychopaths. Finally, we talk about oxytocin and other hormones and neurotransmitters\
  \ that participate in mediating empathic behavior, and the differences between pro-social\
  \ behavior in humans and other animals. \n\nTime Links:  \n00:52  How empathy evolved\
