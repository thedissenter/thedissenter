  \nIn this episode, we talk about empathy and helping behavior in humans and other\
  \ animal models, namely rats. We discuss first how empathy might have evolved, and\
  \ the neurobiological bases of it, including the roles played by the amygdala, the\
  \ hypothalamus, the prefrontal cortex and the temporo-parietal junction. We also\
  \ talk about the flaws with the research surrounding mirror neurons. Then, we talk\
  \ about the situations that invoke empathy. We also refer to Paul Bloom\u2019s book,\
  \ Against Empathy, and the difference between emotional empathy and cognitive empathy,\
  \ and between empathy and compassion. We also briefly refer to how empathy might\
  \ work in psychopaths. Finally, we talk about oxytocin and other hormones and neurotransmitters\
  \ that participate in mediating empathic behavior, and the differences between pro-social\
  \ behavior in humans and other animals. \n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:52</time> How\
