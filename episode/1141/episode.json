	"shownotes": "RECORDED ON AUGUST 11th 2025.  \nDr. Matti H\u00e4yry is Professor of Philosophy at Aalto University School of Business, Finland. Dr. H\u00e4yry\u2019s main fields of interest have been moral and political philosophy and philosophical bioethics. His practical topics in bioethics have ranged from abortion, euthanasia, and resource allocation to genetics, systems biology, and synthetic biology. Theoretically, his work has centered on the main normative doctrines of European moral and political philosophy. He is the co-author of Pure Cloning.\n\nIn this episode, we focus on Pure Cloning. We first define pure and impure cloning. We go through theological objections to human cloning; theoretical moralities, including utilitarianism, deontology, and teleological moralities; ideological rationalities, including the Georgetown principles, and the Barcelona Declaration; and feminist bioethics. Finally, we discuss the relationship between pure cloning and reproduction in general, and the link with antinatalism.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:33</time> Pure and impure cloning  \n<time>02:11</time> Theological objections to human cloning  \n<time>06:38</time> Theoretical moralities: utilitarian  \n<time>13:39</time> Deontology  \n<time>16:37</time> Teleological moralities  \n<time>21:42</time> Ideological rationalities: Georgetown principles  \n<time>26:21</time> The Barcelona Declaration  \n<time>32:47</time> Feminist bioethics  \n<time>35:30</time> The relationship between pure cloning and reproduction in general  \n<time>39:37</time> Antinatalism  \n<time>40:52</time> Follow Dr. H\u00e4yry\u2019s work!\n\n---\n\nFollow Dr. H\u00e4yry\u2019s work:  \nFaculty page: http://tinyurl.com/smpjrpty  \nGoogle Scholar page: http://tinyurl.com/5ym5md6m  \nPure Cloning: https://tinyurl.com/5bftpdtm  \nTwitter handle: @MattiHayry\n",
