shownotes: "RECORDED ON DECEMBER 23rd 2021.  \nDr. Nicole Prause is a neuroscientist\
  \ researching human sexual behavior, addiction, and the physiology of sexual response.\
  \ She is also the founder of Liberos LLC, an independent research institute.\n\n\
  In this episode, we talk about sex, porn, and addiction. We start with sex, and\
  \ hypersexual people. We then get into porn, and ask if it can be addictive, and\
  \ talk about the relationship between porn consumption and sex drive, the effects\
  \ of masturbation, the (negative) psychological effects of watching porn, and if\
  \ it can affect relationship satisfaction and self/partner evaluations. We also\
  \ discuss if the porn industry is bad for its performers; if the brain processes\
  \ sex and porn differently; and who condemns porn, and who reports suffering from\
  \ porn addiction.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:00 Intro  \n00:26  Can sex be addictive?\
