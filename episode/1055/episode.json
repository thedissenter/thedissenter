He is a Nationally Certified School Psychologist and Licensed Psychologist. He is editor of Investigating School Psychology: Pseudoscience, Fringe Science, and Controversies.\n\nIn this episode, we focus on Investigating School Psychology. We first talk about what school psychology is, why such a book is needed, why school psychology is susceptible to pseudoscience, cognitive errors and fallacies, and historical examples of pseudoscience. We then explore contemporary examples, like zero-tolerance policies; prevention of suicide and risky behaviors; IQ tests; projective drawings; learning styles; and motivational theories. Finally, we discuss what educators can learn from this.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:31</time> What is school psychology?  \n<time>05:30</time> Why do we need such a book?  \n<time>10:51</time> Why school psychology is susceptible to pseudoscience  \n<time>14:14</time> Cognitive errors and fallacies  \n<time>21:21</time> Historical examples of pseudoscience  \n<time>28:34</time> Zero-tolerance policies  \n<time>32:35</time> Prevention of suicide and risky behaviors  \n<time>43:03</time> IQ tests  \n<time>47:16</time> Projective drawings  \n<time>52:53</time> Learning styles  \n<time>55:49</time> Motivational theories  \n<time>1:04:12</time> What can educators learn from this?  \n<time>1:11:32</time> Follow Dr. Axelrod\u2019s work!\n\n---\n\nFollow Dr. Axelrod\u2019s work:  \nFaculty page: https://shorturl.at/J1BXW  \nGoogle Scholar page: https://shorturl.at/7lI9j  \nInvestigating School Psychology: https://shorturl.at/hVlOt\n",
