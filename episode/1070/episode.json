Dr. Passos Ferreira has published on philosophy, psychology, and neuroethics.  She has collaborated in cross-cultural research on moral development and social cognition (on topics such as empathy, fairness, ownership, intersubjectivity). Her current research program focuses on the development of consciousness, including what theories of consciousness say about infant consciousness and machine consciousness, and how these theories shed light on ethical issues. \n\nIn this episode, we first talk about consciousness, how to determine that a being is conscious, early conscious states in preverbal infantas, and self-knowledge and a first-person perspective. We then discuss moral development, and the importance of empathy.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:39</time> How to determine that a being is conscious  \n<time>04:19</time> Early conscious states in preverbal infants  \n<time>07:46</time> Self-knowledge and a first-person perspective  \n<time>12:44</time> Moral development  \n<time>15:39</time> Empathy  \n<time>22:31</time> Follow Dr. Ferreira\u2019s work!\n\n---\n\nFollow Dr. Ferreira\u2019s work:  \nFaculty page: https://shorturl.at/6HviW  \nPhilPeople profile: https://shorturl.at/DgUb1  \nX handle: @cpassosf\n",
