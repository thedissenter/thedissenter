We then discuss how technological change can impact the way we understand human beings, digital identities and posthumanism, and implications for anthropology. We also talk about religious robots and their functions, and the ethics of transhumanism. Finally, we talk about digital afterlives and their ethical implications.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:45</time> What is a social robot?  \n<time>02:42</time> Anthropomorphizing robots  \n<time>03:46</time> Can social robots me moral patients?  \n<time>09:44</time> Technological change, and how we understand human beings  \n<time>11:42</time> Digital identities and posthumanism  \n<time>14:48</time> Implications for anthropology  \n<time>17:44</time> Religious robots and their functions  \n<time>27:22</time> Transhumanism and its ethics  \n<time>34:38</time> Digital afterlives  \n<time>41:55</time> Follow Dr. Puzio\u2019s work!\n\n---\n\nFollow Dr. Puzio\u2019s work:  \nUniversity page: https://bit.ly/42QLQ9C  \nWebsite: https://tinyurl.com/bdh59hbs  \nPhilPeople profile: https://bit.ly/4bEUIDc  \nTwitter handle: @PuzioAnna\n",
