	"shownotes": "RECORDED ON MARCH 25th 2024.  \nDr. Craig Callender is Tata Chancellor's Professor of Philosophy and a Founding Faculty and Co-Director of the Institute for Practical Ethics at the University of California, San Diego. His main area of research and teaching is philosophy of science, ranging from the nature of time to various applied social and ethical issues.\n\nIn this episode, we explore the physics of time. We talk about our intuitive model of time, and how it compares to how time actually works. We discuss the spacetime continuum, whether time has a direction, and the tensed theory of time. We talk about how our model of time develops cognitively. We discuss the relationship between Physics and metaphysics. Finally, we talk about the biggest unanswered questions in Physics.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:38</time> Our intuitive model of time  \n<time>02:22</time> How time actually works  \n<time>07:31</time> The spacetime continuum  \n<time>16:43</time> The tensed theory of time  \n<time>22:41</time> How our model of time develops cognitively  \n<time>33:06</time> The relationship between Physics and metaphysics  \n<time>40:49</time> The biggest unanswered questions in Physics  \n<time>44:59</time> Follow Dr. Callender\u2019s work!\n\n---\n\nFollow Dr. Callender\u2019s work:  \nFaculty page: https://bit.ly/3SM2AeY  \nWebsite: https://bit.ly/3SNExfB  \nPhilPeople page: https://bit.ly/3SM2CU8  \nBooks on Amazon: https://bit.ly/48rK4xF\n",
