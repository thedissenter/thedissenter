shownotes: "RECORDED ON JUNE 21st 2022.  \nDr. Allen Buchanan is James B. Duke Distinguished\
  \ Professor Emeritus of Philosophy at Duke University, and Laureate Professor of\
  \ Philosophy at the University of Arizona. He has written six books covering such\
  \ topics as applied ethics (especially bio-medical ethics), social justice, and\
  \ international justice, including the foundations of international law. He is the\
  \ author of Our Moral Fate: Evolution and the Escape from Tribalism.\n\nIn this\
  \ episode, we focus on Our Moral Fate.  We discuss how to think about morality from\
  \ an evolutionary perspective. We get into wrong assumptions people have about tribalism\
  \ and cooperation. We talk about the Two Great Expansions of our moral circle, involving\
  \ human beings and nonhuman animals. We discuss how moral progress occurs, and if\
  \ we should talk about moral change in terms of \u201Cprogress\u201D and \u201C\
  regress\u201D. We talk about moral reasoning and its limitations. We get into what\
  \ ideology is from an evolutionary perspective. Finally, we talk about recent tribalism,\
  \ and scientifically-informed moral institutional design.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:00\
