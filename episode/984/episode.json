	"shownotes": "RECORDED ON NOVEMBER 20th 2023.  \nDr. Andrew Khoury is an Assistant Teaching Professor of Philosophy at Arizona State University. He works primarily at the intersection of moral philosophy, moral psychology, and metaphysics on issues surrounding free will and moral responsibility.\n\nIn this episode, we talk about moral responsibility, punishment, and forgiveness. We start by discussing whether agents can be blameworthy only for acts that are morally wrong. We talk about the role of luck in criminal attempts, and punishment in those cases. We discuss the idea of the penal lottery. We talk about forgiveness and repentance. Finally, we discuss how to determine how much punishment someone deserves, and attributions of moral responsibility to individuals and collectives.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:37</time> Can agents only be blameworthy for acts that are morally wrong?  \n<time>15:52</time> Criminal attempts, luck, and punishment  \n<time>26:02</time> The idea of the penal lottery  \n<time>37:18</time> Forgiveness and repentance  \n<time>46:14</time> How to determine how much punishment someone deserves  \n<time>58:28</time> Attributions of moral responsibility to individuals and collectives  \n<time>1:02:47</time> Follow Dr. Khoury\u2019s work!\n\n---\n\nFollow Dr. Khoury\u2019s work:  \nFaculty page: https://bit.ly/3XiACbd  \nPhilPeople profile: https://bit.ly/3qVSSe2\n",
