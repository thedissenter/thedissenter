shownotes: "RECORDED ON OCTOBER 16th, 2019.  \nDr. Kevin Mitchell is Associate Professor\
  \ of Genetics and Neuroscience at Trinity College Dublin. He is interested in the\
  \ development of connectivity in the brain, specifically in how this process is\
  \ controlled by genes and how mutations in such genes affect the connectivity of\
  \ neuronal circuits, influence behavior and perception and contribute to disease.\
  \ His research group uses genetic approaches in the mouse to address these questions,\
  \ and they are also involved in collaborative research looking at the genetics and\
  \ phenotypic manifestations of synaesthesia and schizophrenia in humans. He\u2019\
  s the author of a book that came out last year, Innate: How the Wiring of Our Brains\
  \ Shapes Who We Are.\n\nIn this episode, we focus on Dr. Mitchell\u2019s book, Innate.\
  \ We first talk about how to square off human nature with individual variation,\
  \ and how the genome does not encode a person, and is not the only source of innateness\
  \ to psychological traits. We also discuss behavioral genetics, the \u201Cnon-shared\
  \ environment\u201D, and the conclusions we can derive from polygenic scores. We\
  \ then refer to how personality shapes the way we experience the world, neuroplasticity,\
  \ and psychological epigenetics. Toward the end, we also talk about how difficult\
  \ it is to study group differences, and where sex differences come from and if it\
  \ makes sense to talk about a \u201Cmale\u201D and a \u201Cfemale\u201D brain.\n\
