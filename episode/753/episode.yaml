  \ as Professor in the Institute for the History and Philosophy of Science and Technology\
  \ and the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at the University of Toronto.\
  \ He has published extensively on evolutionary theory, population genetics, mathematical\
  \ modelling in biology, theory structure in biology, philosophy of medicine, and\
  \ ethics. He is the author of Evolution, Morality and the Fabric of Society.\n\n\
  In this episode, we focus on Evolution, Morality and the Fabric of Society. We first\
  \ talk about a social contract theory of morality, evolutionary reproductive success,\
  \ kin selection and reciprocal altruism, and the role of rational deliberation.\
  \ We go through three derived principles of inclusion, individual sovereignty (liberty),\
  \ and equality, and social issues like patriarchy, individual sovereignty and copulatory\
  \ choices, and overpopulation and extinction. Finally, we ask if an evolutionary\
  \ account of human morality commits us to moral anti-realism.\n\nTime Links:  \n\
