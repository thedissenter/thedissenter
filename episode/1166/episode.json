We start by discussing why we need to know about economic theory, whether economics is a science, and how it is theory-driven. We also discuss whether Homo economicus exists, explanation and prediction in economics, and whether it is ideology-driven. We talk about game theory, why we can\u2019t do without economic theory, and institution design. Finally, we discuss economics and political activism.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:25</time> Why do we need to know about economic theory?  \n<time>02:21</time> Is economics a science?  \n<time>04:18</time> Economics is theory-driven  \n<time>06:47</time> Does Homo economicus exist?  \n<time>09:57</time> Explanation and prediction  \n<time>19:16</time> Is economics ideology-driven?  \n<time>26:17</time> Game theory  \n<time>32:09</time> Why can\u2019t we do without economic theory?  \n<time>34:07</time> Institution design  \n<time>42:27</time> Economics and political activism  \n<time>47:48</time> Follow Dr. Rosenberg\u2019s work!\n\n---\n\nFollow Dr. Rosenberg\u2019s work:  \nFaculty page: https://tinyurl.com/ydby3b5f  \nWebsite: http://www.alexrose46.com/  \nBooks: https://tinyurl.com/yag2n2fn  \nBlunt Instrument: https://tinyurl.com/sve8ycz2\n",
