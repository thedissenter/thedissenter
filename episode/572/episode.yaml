  \ Professor of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology in the Department of Ecology and\
  \ Evolutionary Biology, and Adjunct Professor of Obstetrics, Gynecology and Reproductive\
  \ Sciences at Yale University, and Adjunct Professor of Obstetrics and Gynecology\
  \ at Wayne State University. He is an evolutionary geneticist with training in biochemical\
  \ engineering, zoology and mathematics from the University of Vienna, Austria. Dr.\
  \ Wagner's research interest is the evolution of gene regulation as it pertains\
  \ to the origin of evolutionary novelties. In particular the lab is focusing on\
  \ the evolution of the endometrial stromal cells in the context of the evolutionary\
  \ origin of pregnancy. Another focus of his lab is the developmental basis of character\
  \ identity, as for instance in the case of digit identity of birds.\n\nIn this episode,\
  \ we talk about gene regulation, evolutionary novelties, and pregnancy. We start\
  \ with gene evolution, why it evolved, its importance in evolution, pleiotropy and\
  \ polygeny, and the relationship between development and evolution. We then get\
  \ into evolutionary novelties, complex organisms, functional specialization, and\
  \ the concept of \u201Cevolvability\u201D. Finally, we talk about the evolution\
  \ of pregnancy, endometrial stromal cells, why the fetus is not attacked by the\
  \ mother\u2019s immune system, and the relationship between invasive placentation\
  \ and malignant cancer.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:00 Intro  \n00:42  The evolution of\
