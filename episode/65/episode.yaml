excerpt: 'Dr. Dale Purves is Geller Professor of Neurobiology Emeritus at the Center
  for Cognitive Neuroscience, at Duke University. He was elected to the National Academy
  of Sciences in 1989 for his work on neural development and synaptic plasticity.
  He is a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the National Academy
  of Medicine. He is the author of many books, including Principles of Neural Development,
  and Brains: How they Seem to Work, and also the lead author on the textbooks Neuroscience,
  and Principles of Cognitive Neuroscience. His research during the last 15 years
  has sought to explain why we see and hear what we do, focusing on the visual perception
  of lightness, color, form, and motion, and the auditory perception of music and
  speech.'

  \ has sought to explain why we see and hear what we do, focusing on the visual perception\
  \ of lightness, color, form, and motion, and the auditory perception of music and\
  \ speech.\n\nIn this episode, we talk about how perception evolved and works; how\
  \ our cognitive systems have an innate structural organization, but also allow for\
  \ neuroplasticity at the same time; what are illusions; if there\u2019s any direct\
  \ relation between conscious perception and the production of behavior, as when\
  \ we\u2019re driving and thinking about something, and not consciously aware of\
  \ our surroundings; understanding perception in wholly empirical terms; and the\
  \ proper way to look at the relationship between perception and reality as such.\n\
  \nTime Links:  \n01:08  The evolutionary basis of perception  \n07:09  Do our brains\
  \ make inferences based on limited information?    \n08:48  How do we combine innate\
  \ structural organization with neuroplasticity?    \n10:46  Our brains contain innate\
  \ information in the way they\u2019re structured    \n12:57  Fixed action patterns,\
  \ or \u201Cinstincts\u201D    \n13:52  Are illusions errors in cognition?    \n\
  16:08  Is there any direct relation between conscious perception and the production\
  \ of behavior?    \n18:36  Understanding vision (and perception) in wholly empirical\
  \ terms    \n22:30  Putting aside the distinction between \u201Creality as such\u201D\
  \ and our experience of reality    \n24:59  What is \u201Creal\u201D?  \n26:46 \
