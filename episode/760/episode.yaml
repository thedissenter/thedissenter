  \ International Politics at King's College London's Department of Political Economy.\
  \ His research is primarily concerned with the role of ideology in collective political\
  \ violence, especially in forms of violence against civilians such as genocides,\

  \ on Ideology and Mass Killing. We first define mass killings, and get into explanations\
  \ presented on the media; what ideology is; how ideologies can influence political\
  \ behavior; non-ideological explanations; and Dr. Maynard\u2019s neo-ideological\
  \ explanation. We discuss the \u201Ctrue believers\u201D, and how non-believers\
  \ can still be influenced; why mass killings take different forms; why they occur;\
  \ the role played by ideological propaganda and hate speech; if threats are ever\
  \ real; and if it is possible to predict and prevent mass killings.\n\n\nTime Links:\
