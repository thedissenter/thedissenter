shownotes: "Dr. Patrick Lee Miller is an associate professor of Philosophy at Duquesne\
  \ University, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. He is the author of Becoming God: Pure\
  \ Reason in Early Greek Philosophy (Bloomsbury, 2012), and co-editor of Introductory\
  \ Readings in Ancient Greek and Roman Philosophy (Hackett, 2015). He also writes\
  \ for Quillette.\n\nIn this episode, we talk about the philosophy of the Black Mirror\
  \ series, by Charlie Brooker. We go through some of the general themes we were able\
  \ to identify running through the series, including: the individual and social aspects\
  \ of life, and their interplay; the role that technology plays, and if it leaves\
  \ space open for human agency; personhood, the self, copies, simulations, and how\
  \ we should deal with them; what it is to be the \u201Ctrue\u201D person; the benefits\
  \ of virtual reality, as well as its drawbacks; mortality, immortality, and the\
  \ meaning of life; punishment and Nietzsche\u2019s Eternal Return; how we should\
  \ deal with memory and knowledge, and what we should know. In the latter part of\
  \ the discussion, we also talk about the usefulness of thought experiments, the\
  \ relationship between philosophy and science, and the Platonic soul.\n\nTime Links:\
