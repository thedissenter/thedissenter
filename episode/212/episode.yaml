excerpt: 'Dr. Donald Hoffman is a Professor in the Department of Cognitive Sciences
  at the University of California, Irvine. Dr. Hoffman studies consciousness, visual
  perception and evolutionary psychology using mathematical models and psychophysical
  experiments. His research subjects include facial attractiveness, the recognition
  of shape, the perception of motion and color, the evolution of perception, and the
  mind-body problem. He has co-authored two technical books: Observer Mechanics: A
  Formal Theory of Perception, and Automotive Lighting and Human Vision. He is just
  about to release a new book, The Case Against Reality: Why Evolution Hid the Truth
  from Our Eyes.'

  \ visual perception) works, how it has evolved, and the implications that has to\
  \ how we deal with \u201Cobjective reality\u201D. First, Dr. Hoffman explains how\
  \ he studies the architecture of vision. We discuss the evolutionary rationale behind\
  \ perception, or how it has evolved \u2013 the interface theory of perception. In\
  \ the second part, we go a little bit metaphysical, and discuss what is reality,\
  \ and the role that consciousness plays in it. \n\nTime Links:  \n01:45  How vision\
