	"shownotes": "RECORDED ON SEPTEMBER 4th 2024.  \nLouis Bachaud is a PhD student at the University of Kent and the University of Lille. His research investigates the history and sociology of science. In particular, he studies the contemporary (mis)understandings of evolutionary sciences and their appropriations in online debates around sex and gender.\n\nIn this episode, we talk about the misuse of evolutionary science in the manosphere. We start by discussing what the manosphere is. We then explore sets of claims about female sexuality, the ovulatory cycle, gender roles, and \u201calpha males\u201d. We talk about the possible motives of people who produce content for the manosphere, as well as the consumers. We discuss why evolutionary psychology is so popular. Finally, we talk about some of the ways we can fight back against the misuse of evolutionary science in the manosphere.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:46</time> What is the manosphere?  \n<time>07:34</time> Claims about female sexuality  \n<time>16:07</time> The benefits of short-term and extra-pair mating  \n<time>22:06</time> Claims about the ovulatory cycle  \n<time>30:38</time> Cherry-picking studies  \n<time>37:09</time> The motives behind the manosphere  \n<time>47:45</time> Why is evolutionary psychology so popular?  \n<time>1:07:20</time> Claims about gender roles  \n<time>1:14:09</time> Claims about \u201calpha males\u201d  \n<time>1:25:14</time> Fighting back against the misuse of evolutionary science  \n<time>1:34:48</time> Follow Louis\u2019 work!\n\n---\n\nFollow Louis\u2019 work:  \nResearchGate profile: https://tinyurl.com/skm259fx  \nAcademia.edu page: https://tinyurl.com/y67fvu3w\n",
