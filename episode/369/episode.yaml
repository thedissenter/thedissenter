excerpt: 'Dr. Alberto Acerbi is a Lecturer in Psychology in the Centre for Culture
  and Evolution at Brunel University London. He is a cognitive/evolutionary anthropologist
  with a particular interest in computational science. The main question that drives
  his research is: is it possible to find some general factors determining why some
  cultural traits succeed and others do not? He is interested in particular in contemporary
  cultural phenomena, and he uses a naturalistic, quantitative, and evolutionary approach
  with different methodologies, especially individual-based models and quantitative
  analysis of large-scale data. He published a book recently, Cultural Evolution in
  the Digital Age.'

  \ in the Centre for Culture and Evolution at Brunel University London. He is a cognitive/evolutionary\
  \ anthropologist with a particular interest in computational science. The main question\
  \ that drives his research is: is it possible to find some general factors determining\
  \ why some cultural traits succeed and others do not? He is interested in particular\
  \ in contemporary cultural phenomena, and he uses a naturalistic, quantitative,\
  \ and evolutionary approach with different methodologies, especially individual-based\
  \ models and quantitative analysis of large-scale data. He published a book recently,\
  \ Cultural Evolution in the Digital Age.\n\nIn this episode, we focus on Dr. Acerbi\u2019\
  s book, and go through some of its main topics, like the impact of new technologies\
  \ on cultural evolution; the similarities and differences between online activity\
  \ and real life; the impact of celebrities and online influencers; echo chambers\
  \ and political polarization; post-truth; and the opacity of online algorithms.\
  \ Toward the end, we also discuss theories in cultural evolution.\n\nTime Links:\

  \ through cultural evolution?  \n<time>03:10</time> The main differences between\
  \ new and older communication technologies  \n<time>08:04</time> Dunbar\u2019s number,\
  \ and the number of friends we have on social media  \n<time>14:11</time> Can we\
  \ also learn about how cultural evolution works in real life by studying online\
  \ phenomena?  \n<time>16:56</time> Can these technologies impact the evolution of\
  \ our cognition?  \n<time>19:53</time> People are not gullible  \n<time>24:43</time>\
