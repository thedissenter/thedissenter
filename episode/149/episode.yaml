  \ Killing the Competition: Economic Inequality and Homicide. \n\nIn this episode,\
  \ the conversation revolves around violence and homicide, and the main topics of\
  \ the books Homicide and Killing the Competition. First, we talk about the evolutionary\
  \ bases of violent behavior, as a means of controlling other people\u2019s behavior\
  \ and regulating relationships. We also go through the evolved sex differences in\
  \ aggressiveness, as a result of intrasexual and intersexual competition. Then,\
  \ we talk specifically about homicide, and why it might also happen in familial\
  \ conflicts, even though it is quite rare. We also refer to the potential problems\
  \ with having an approach that favors pathologizing all types of violent and deviant\
  \ behavior. Finally, we talk about the relationship between economic inequality\
  \ and homicide, as explored in Killing the Competition, and how it affects primarily\
  \ young men, and the environmental and social circumstances that trigger it. Toward\
  \ the end, we also refer to the importance of the State having the monopoly over\
  \ violence and its relationship with social stability, and the benefits that we\
  \ get from economic redistribution.  \n\nTime Links:  \n02:03  The evolved function\
