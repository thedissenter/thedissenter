	"shownotes": "RECORDED ON APRIL 4th 2025.  \nDr. Richard Wolff is Professor of Economics Emeritus at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. He is currently a Visiting Professor in the Graduate Program in International Affairs of the New School University, New York City. He is also the co-founder of Democracy at Work and host of their nationally syndicated show Economic Update. Over the last 25 years, in collaboration with his colleague, Stephen Resnick, he has developed a new approach to political economy. While it retains and systematically elaborates the Marxist notion of class as surplus labor, it rejects the economic determinism typical of most schools of economics and usually associated with Marxism as well.\n\nIn this episode, we first talk about Trump\u2019s tariffs and their consequences, and we discuss whether tariffs can work. We also talk about Elon Musk and his influence on American politics. Finally, we discuss the BRICS, and the place of Europe in the modern world.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:35</time> Trump\u2019s tariffs and their consequences  \n<time>16:21</time> Can tariffs work?  \n<time>27:23</time> Elon Musk and his influence on American politics  \n<time>45:25</time> The BRICS  \n<time>54:36</time> The place of Europe in the modern world  \n<time>1:01:58</time> Follow Dr. Wolff\u2019s work!\n\n---\n\nFollow Dr. Wolff\u2019s work:  \nOur first interview: https://youtu.be/tJunzJzuBcQ  \nWebsite: https://www.rdwolff.com/  \nYouTube channel: @RichardDWolff  \nBooks on Amazon: https://tinyurl.com/39jnfda4  \nX handle: @profwolff\n",
