	"title": "#1185 Giovanni Rolla: Enactivism, Ecological Psychology, and Embodied Cognition",
	"published": "2025-12-05",
	"shownotes": "RECORDED ON SEPTEMBER 10th 2025.  \nDr. Giovanni Rolla is Professor of Philosophy at Federal University of Bahia (UFBA), Brazil. His research is about enactivism, ecological psychology and radically embodied cognition in general (sometimes he deals with traditional epistemology as well, especially know-how, normativity and rationality). He is also a founding member of the Enactive Cognition and Narrative Practices research group (University of Wollongong), and a founding member of the Cognition, Language, Enaction and Affectivity research group.\n\nIn this episode, we start by talking about enactivism, and how it differs from cognitivism and other traditional approaches in cognitive science. We talk about combining enactivism, ecological psychology and embodied cognition. We discuss what information is in cognitive science, what know-how is, and the enactivist conception of \u201cbringing forth a world\u201d. We talk about the relationship between enactivism and evolutionary dynamics, and evolution as natural drift. We discuss whether pre-linguistic infants have representational abilities. Finally, we talk about Radically Enactive Cognition, and how rationality is approached from this perspective.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:39</time> What is enactivism?  \n<time>14:21</time> Combining enactivism, ecological psychology and embodied cognition  \n<time>19:29</time> What is information in cognitive science?  \n<time>24:27</time> What is know-how?  \n<time>28:35</time> The enactivist conception of \u201cbringing forth a world\u201d  \n<time>32:18</time> Evolution as natural drift  \n<time>37:19</time> Do pre-linguistic infants have representational abilities?  \n<time>43:28</time> Radically Enactive Cognition  \n<time>51:22</time> Rationality from a Radically Enactive Cognition perspective  \n<time>55:53</time> Follow Dr. Rolla\u2019s work!\n\n---\n\nFollow Dr. Rolla\u2019s work:  \nWebsite: https://www.giovannirolla.com/  \nPhilPeople profile: https://tinyurl.com/ph84zped  \nX handle: @halterofilosofo\n",
