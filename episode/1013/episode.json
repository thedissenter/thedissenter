	"shownotes": "RECORDED ON MAY 14th 2024.  \nDr. Aaron Lukaszewski is Associate Professor in the Department of Psychology & Center for the Study of Human Nature at California State University, Fullerton. His research topics include status hierarchy, leadership, group cooperation, personality variation, social comparison, social valuation, partner preferences, and anthropometrics.\n\nIn this episode, we talk about personality from an evolutionary perspective. We discuss what such an approach entails, whether personality traits are adaptations, and personality taxonomies. We talk about the factors behind interpersonal variation in personality, work by Dr. Lukaszewski in a group of horticultural-foragers in Conambo, Ecuador, and what we can learn from the study of traditional societies. We discuss the goals of description, prediction, and explanation in personality science, and whether a General Factor of Personality exists. Finally, we talk about the costs and benefits of high social status in human societies.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:29</time> How to approach personality from an evolutionary perspective  \n<time>08:26</time> Are personality traits adaptations?  \n<time>13:32</time> Personality inventories, and personality taxonomies  \n<time>20:44</time> Explaining interpersonal variation in personality  \n<time>24:54</time> Personality in a group of horticultural-foragers in Conambo, Ecuador  \n<time>30:32</time> What we can learn from traditional societies  \n<time>32:39</time> Description, prediction, and explanation in personality science  \n<time>39:43</time> A General Factor of Personality?  \n<time>48:51</time> The costs and benefits of high social status in human societies  \n<time>1:07:00</time> Follow Dr. Lukaszewski\u2019s work!\n\n---\n\nFollow Dr. Lukaszewski\u2019s work:  \nFaculty page: https://bit.ly/3U0fw1I  \nWebsite: https://shorturl.at/qAFX0  \nResearchGate profile: https://shorturl.at/dDOWY  \nTwitter handle: @SpeciesTypical\n",
