Zajonc Collegiate Professor of Psychology and Director of the Culture & Cognition Program at the University of Michigan. His research revolves around cultural differences and similarities in a variety of mental processes such as self, emotion and cognition. He has focused on comparing people from Asian countries such as Japan, the Philippines and China with Americans.\n\nIn this episode, we start by talking about cultural neuroscience, how brain processes are malleably shaped by cultural tools and practices, and how to integrate mind, brain and culture. We then discuss the self, well-being, and emotional experiences and emotion norms. We also talk about differences in cognition between farmers and herders, and differences between people who harvest rice and people who harvest wheat in China. Finally, we discuss the main differences in cognition between Westerners and East Asians, and where they stem from.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:48</time> What is cultural neuroscience?  \n<time>03:23</time> How are brain processes malleably shaped by cultural tools and practices?  \n<time>05:59</time> How are cultural differences in psychological traits studied?  \n<time>09:12</time> The self  \n<time>17:34</time> Well-being  \n<time>20:17</time> Emotional experiences and emotion norms  \n<time>28:12</time> Differences in cognition between farmers and herders  \n<time>32:33</time> Harvesting rice versus wheat in China  \n<time>34:10</time> Differences in cognition between Westerners and East Asians  \n<time>47:51</time> Follow Dr. Kitayama\u2019s work!\n\n---\n\nFollow Dr. Kitayama\u2019s work:  \nFaculty page: https://tinyurl.com/r3pss3vk  \nResearchGate profile: https://tinyurl.com/ydm5rmhe\n",
