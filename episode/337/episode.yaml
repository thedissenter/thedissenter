shownotes: "RECORDED ON April 15th, 2020.  \nDr. Ann-Sophie Barwich is Assistant Professor\
  \ of History and Philosophy of Science and Cognitive Science at Indiana University\
  \ Bloomington. She is a cognitive scientist and empirical philosopher & historian\
  \ of science, technology, and the senses. She divides her brain-time between the\
  \ Department of History & Philosophy of Science and the Cognitive Science Program.\
  \ Estimated begin of lab (EEG/Olfactometry) in early 2021. She\u2019s the author\
  \ of Smellosophy: What the Nose tells the Mind.\n\nIn this episode, we start off\
  \ by talking about the scientific method, how it evolved over time, the difficulties\
  \ in defining or characterizing it. We refer to the fact that different branches\
  \ of science and of philosophy of science approach their objects of study in different\
  \ ways; the place for fiction in science, and how we should think about modelling\
  \ in science; empirical success; a minority view on the replication crisis, and\
  \ the importance of failure in the scientific process; falsification, and the demarcation\
  \ problem. Then, we get into Dr. Barwich\u2019s work on the sense of olfaction,\
  \ how it works, and a new view it gives us of how the brain works more broadly,\
  \ and also how it reframes certain questions and big topics in the philosophy of\
  \ neuroscience.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:46  How to define the scientific method  \n\
  03:16  Different branches of science and philosophy of science  \n13:29  Is there\
  \ a place for fiction in science?  \n17:21  What is empirical success in science?\
  \  \n21:03  Is the replication crisis a real crisis? And the importance of failure\
  \ in science.  \n28:50  Karl Popper, falsification, and the demarcation problem\
  \  \n32:57  What is so special about the sense of olfaction? And other more broader\
  \ questions within the philosophy of neuroscience.  \n39:52  Integrating philosophy\
  \ of neuroscience and philosophy of mind, and questions surrounding subjective experiences,\
  \ reductionism, and emergentism  \n53:47  Follow Dr. Barwich\u2019s work!\n\n---\n\
