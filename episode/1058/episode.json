We talk about the ethics of technology, and a three-step approach to ethical reflection, inquiry, and deliberation. We discuss whether technology is neutral, what value is, the trolley problem, the importance of privacy for users, and responsibility. We talk about four different ethical approaches: consequentialism, deontology, relational ethics, and virtue ethics. We discuss where people can start when developing a new kind of technology, and we talk about three different methods: Human-Centred Design, Value Sensitive Design, and Responsible Innovation.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:28</time> The ethics of technology  \n<time>06:01</time> A 3-step approach to ethical reflection, inquiry, and deliberation  \n<time>08:47</time> Is technology neutral?  \n<time>15:05</time> What is value?  \n<time>18:17</time> The trolley problem  \n<time>23:44</time> The importance of privacy  \n<time>26:52</time> Responsibility  \n<time>30:34</time> Ethical approaches: consequentialism, deontology, relational ethics, and virtue ethics  \n<time>46:43</time> Where can people start?  \n<time>49:40</time> Human-Centred Design, Value Sensitive Design, and Responsible Innovation  \n<time>57:56</time> Follow Dr. Steen\u2019s work!\n\n---\n\nFollow Dr. Steen\u2019s work:  \nWebsite: https://bit.ly/3T4e9OC  \nResearchGate profile: https://bit.ly/3UL03CN  \nEthics for People Who Work in Tech: https://bit.ly/3J2x5XX  \nTwitter handle: @marcsteen\n",
