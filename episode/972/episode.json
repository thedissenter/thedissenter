She has made pioneering contributions to the study of how language is created and learned, and how the gestures that go along with speech facilitate learning and communication. Dr. Goldin-Meadow is a member of the National Academy of Sciences, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and the American Association for the Advancement of Science. She\u2019s received a Guggenheim Fellowship, a James McKeen Cattell Fund Fellowship, and the David E. Rumelhart Prize. She is the author of several books, including Thinking with Your Hands: The Surprising Science Behind How Gestures Shape Our Thoughts.\n\nIn this episode, we focus on Thinking with Your Hands. We start by talking about the importance of studying gestures, the gestures of non-human animals, the functions of gestures, and their cognitive benefits. We discuss how gestures can help us learn new concepts, and their role in the classroom. We talk about nonverbal communication, and how it influences interpretation. We talk about the gestures (homesigns) created by deaf children. Finally, we discuss how the study of gestures can apply to parenting, and in the education system, by helping underprivileged children.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:45</time> Studying gestures  \n<time>04:00</time> The gestures of non-human animals  \n<time>06:16</time> Why do we use gestures when we have language?  \n<time>08:06</time> The cognitive benefits of gesturing  \n<time>11:10</time> Learning new concepts  \n<time>14:05</time> Gestures in the classroom  \n<time>17:34</time> Nonverbal communication, and how it influences interpretation  \n<time>23:43</time> Deaf children and their homesigns  \n<time>34:24</time> Parenting  \n<time>36:23</time> Education, and helping underprivileged children  \n<time>43:30</time> Follow Dr. Goldin-Meadow\u2019s work!\n\n---\n\nFollow Dr. Goldin-Meadow\u2019s work:  \nFaculty page: https://bit.ly/49UblK8  \nWebsite:   \nResearchGate profile: https://bit.ly/3Qe78sS  \nThinking with Your Hands: https://bit.ly/46ThbJz\n",
