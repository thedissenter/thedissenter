	"shownotes": "RECORDED ON MAY 20th 2024.  \nDr. Julia Hermann is an Assistant Professor of Philosophy and Ethics at the University of Twente where she works on ectogestative technology, care robots, technomoral change and progress, and new methodologies in the ethics of technology.\n\nIn this episode, we talk about the ethics of ectogestative technologies. We distinguish between partial-ectogestation and full-ectogestation, and talk about their ethical implications and medical applications. We discuss how these technologies could disrupt concepts like \u201cbirth\u201d, \u201cbody\u201d, \u201cfetus\u201d, \u201cneonate\u201d, \u201cfather\u201d, \u201cmother\u201d, and \u201cparent\u201d, as well as how we think about abortion, gender roles, and trans women as parents. We then talk about technomoral revolutions, and explore the example of contraceptive technology and sexual morality. We discuss the materialist basis of ideas. Finally, we talk about technomoral resilience, and how we can learn to deal with moral change.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:28</time> What is ectogestative technology?  \n<time>03:27</time> Ethical implications  \n<time>06:07</time> The medical applications of ectogestative technology  \n<time>09:07</time> Disrupting concepts like \u201cbirth, \u201cbody\u201d, \u201cfetus\u201d, and \u201cneonate\u201d  \n<time>15:15</time> How we think about abortion  \n<time>20:18</time> The concepts of \u201cfather\u201d, \u201cmother\u201d, and \u201cparent\u201d  \n<time>24:32</time> Gender roles  \n<time>32:23</time> Trans women as parents  \n<time>38:51</time> Technomoral revolutions  \n<time>43:15</time> Contraceptive technology and sexual morality  \n<time>46:54</time> The materialist basis of ideas  \n<time>51:20</time> Technomoral resilience, and dealing with moral change  \n<time>1:02:09</time> Follow Dr. Hermann\u2019s work!\n\n---\n\nFollow Dr. Hermann\u2019s work:  \nOur first interview: https://youtu.be/Q9D4wlp8yrg  \nFaculty page: https://bit.ly/45ZCM2F  \nAcademia.edu page: https://bit.ly/3Zvt1qU\n",
