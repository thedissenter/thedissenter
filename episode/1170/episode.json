Dr. Scheidel's research ranges from ancient social and economic history and premodern historical demography to the comparative and transdisciplinary world history of inequality, state formation, and human welfare. He is particularly interested in connecting the humanities, the social sciences, and the life sciences. He is the author of several books, the most recent one being What Is Ancient History?\n\nIn this episode, we focus on What Is Ancient History? We first talk about the study of ancient history, and ancient history as a foundational phase. We then discuss how academics have approached ancient history, the focus on Greece and Rome, and the \u201cClassics\u201d, and ancient history in a multiethnic world. Finally, we talk about what can be done to improve the study of ancient history, the impact of ancient history on our lives today, and the future of ancient studies.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:27</time> Studying ancient history?  \n<time>06:24</time> Ancient history as a foundational phase  \n<time>15:30</time> How academics have approached ancient history  \n<time>20:05</time> The focus on Greece and Rome, and the \u201cClassics\u201d  \n<time>28:45</time> Ancient history in a multiethnic world  \n<time>31:14</time> What can be done to improve the study of ancient history  \n<time>38:53</time> The impact of ancient history on our lives today  \n<time>40:38</time> The future of ancient studies  \n<time>42:32</time> Follow Dr. Scheidel\u2019s work!\n\n---\n\nFollow Dr. Scheidel\u2019s work:  \nFaculty page: https://tinyurl.com/427aeesx  \nWhat Is Ancient History?: https://tinyurl.com/2cv92jbp  \nX handle: @WalterScheidel\n",
