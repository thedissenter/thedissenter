excerpt: Dr. Ashley Thomas is a postdoctoral fellow at the center for research on
  open and equitable scholarship at MIT. She is interested in humans as a social species.
  She investigates what infants, toddlers, and children think about social relationships
  (i.e., their naive sociology). She has studied how they think and feel about social
  hierarchy (i.e. situations where there is a 'winner' and a 'loser' or when someone
  is 'in charge.'). Currently, she is working with Elizabeth Spelke and Rebecca Saxe,
  and they are investigating how infants interpret social interactions that involve
  their own caregivers as well as how infants, toddlers, and children think about
  social intimacy. She has also studied people's moral judgments of parenting decisions.

shownotes: "RECORDED ON NOVEMBER 8th 2021.  \nDr. Ashley Thomas is a postdoctoral\
  \ fellow at the center for research on open and equitable scholarship at MIT. She\
  \ is interested in humans as a social species. She investigates what infants, toddlers,\
  \ and children think about social relationships (i.e., their naive sociology). She\
  \ has studied how they think and feel about social hierarchy (i.e. situations where\
  \ there is a 'winner' and a 'loser' or when someone is 'in charge.'). Currently,\
  \ she is working with Elizabeth Spelke and Rebecca Saxe, and they are investigating\
  \ how infants interpret social interactions that involve their own caregivers as\
  \ well as how infants, toddlers, and children think about social intimacy. She has\
  \ also studied people's moral judgments of parenting decisions.\n\nIn this episode,\
  \ we talk about developmental psychology. We focus a lot on children\u2019s na\xEF\
  ve sociology, and how they think about social relationships. We get into issues\
  \ surrounding social hierarchy, how children think about helpers and hinderers,\
  \ winners and losers, and low and high-ranking individuals. We talk about the kinds\
  \ of leaders children prefer. We discuss what children learn from social interactions\
  \ involving their own caregivers, and how they think about social intimacy. Finally,\
  \ we discuss the relation between people\u2019s theories of intelligence and beliefs\
  \ about brain development, and parenting.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:00 Intro  \n00:37\
