Vilas Research Professor in the Department of Philosophy at the University of Wisconsin–Madison. Dr. Sober is noted for his work in philosophy of biology and general philosophy of science. He’s the author of books like Philosophy of Biology, Unto Others: The Evolution and Psychology of Unselfish Behavior, and The Design Argument.\n\nIn this episode, we focus our conversation on the topic of group selection. We establish the kinds of behavior that group selectin allows for us to have a better grasp on, particularly altruistic behavior. Then we talk about the limitations of a gene-centered approach to natural selection; how people (wrongly) think about evolution; and the averaging fallacy. We also discuss the role of rewards and punishments in the evolution of altruism, and the development of social norms. Finally, we talk about how multilevel selection works, and the extended evolutionary synthesis.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:47</time> What is a group?  \n<time>04:30</time> Altruism, and other behaviors group selection applies to  \n<time>08:44</time> Genetic and cultural group selection  \n<time>15:12</time> Are there really genuinely self-sacrificial behaviors?  \n<time>19:51</time> Are there group-level adaptations?  \n<time>23:12</time> Is there species-level selection?  \n<time>26:04</time> Are kin selection and reciprocal altruism enough?  \n<time>29:21</time> Problems with a gene-centered approach to evolution  \n<time>33:40</time> How people think about evolution  \n<time>37:15</time> The averaging fallacy  \n<time>42:16</time> The role of social rewards and punishments in the evolution of altruism  \n<time>46:16</time> The role of social norms, and how they develop  \n<time>49:41</time> How multilevel selection works  \n<time>54:09</time> Should we have an extended evolutionary synthesis?  \n<time>1:00:20</time> Follow Dr. Sober’s work!\n\n---\n\nFollow Dr. Sober’s work:  \nFaculty page: http://bit.ly/37bWQzG  \nWebsite: http://bit.ly/2tEu8tC  \nPhilPeople page: https://bit.ly/2ZXsW0D  \nAmazon page: https://amzn.to/38LrqCX  \nUnto Others: The Evolution and Psychology of Unselfish Behavior: https://amzn.to/3bpjmsb  \nDid Darwin Write the Origin Backwards?: https://amzn.to/3iMslYp\n",
