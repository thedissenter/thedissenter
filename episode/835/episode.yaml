  \ of Anthropology and the Sumitomo Professor Emeritus of Japanese Studies at Yale\
  \ University. A noted authority on the social and historical anthropology of Japan,\
  \ Dr. Kelly focused much of his research for two decades on regional society in\
  \ Japan, based on extensive fieldwork in the Sh\u014Dnai area of Yamagata Prefecture.\
  \ He has also written widely on the broader dynamics of class formation in Japanese\

  \ sport and body culture and their significance in modern Japan. He has also written\
  \ on the history of Japan anthropology and its importance for Japan studies and\
  \ for sociocultural anthropology.\n\nIn this episode, we talk about topics in the\
  \ sociocultural anthropology of Japan. We discuss the work Dr. Kelly has done on\
  \ the social organization of the Japanese countryside, particularly in the Sh\u014D\
  nai area, and how it might generalize to the rest of Japan. We talk about Tokugawa\
  \ Japan. We discuss class formation and hierarchy in Japan. We talk about the Japanese\
  \ economic crisis of the late 80s/early 90s, and some social and economic challenges\
  \ in contemporary Japan, focusing on singlehood, the hikikomori, and suicide rates.\
  \ We discuss the study of sports culture, and how it ties to body culture, geopolitics,\
  \ gender, and race. Finally, we talk about the role and contribution of ethnography\
  \ and sociocultural anthropology to social science inquiry.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:00\
