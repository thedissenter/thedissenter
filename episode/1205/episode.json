She has a YouTube channel (@JasmineSherni).\n\nIn this episode, we start by talking about how Jasmine got into porn. We discuss whether porn is for anyone, the fetishization of cultural minorities, and social stigma. We talk about assumptions people make about sex work and porn, sex education, whether sex work is a choice, whether it can be empowering, and hypocrisy coming from religious and conservative people. Finally, we talk about the role of sex.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:24</time> How Jasmine got into porn  \n<time>08:26</time> Is porn for anyone?  \n<time>20:50</time> Fetishization of cultural minorities  \n<time>24:03</time> Social stigma  \n<time>27:47</time> Assumptions about sex work and porn  \n<time>30:12</time> Sex education  \n<time>35:46</time> Is sex work a choice?  \n<time>41:09</time> Can sex work be empowering?  \n<time>47:35</time> Hypocrisy from religious and conservative people  \n<time>49:55</time> The role of sex  \n<time>57:22</time> Follow Jasmine\u2019s work!\n\n---\n\nFollow Jasmine\u2019s work:  \nX handle: @jasminesherni_  \nFacebook: https://tinyurl.com/cv92pcm3  \nInstagram: @jasminesherni_  \nTikTok: @all_thatjasmine\n",
