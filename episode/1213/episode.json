Lents is Professor of Biology at John Jay College. Dr. Lents is noted for his work in cell biology, genetics, and forensic science, as well as his popular science writing and blogging on the evolution of human biology and behavior. He is the author of several books, the most recent one being The Sexual Evolution: How 500 Million Years of Sex, Gender, and Mating Shape Modern Relationships.\n\nIn this episode, we focus on The Sexual Evolution. We first discuss what we can learn by looking at the natural history of sex, and how sex is defined. We talk about gender, homosexuality and same-sex behaviors, and whether reproduction is the only goal of sex. We also discuss monogamy and mating systems, and trans people from a biological perspective. Finally, we talk about where prejudice against diversity stems from.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:29</time> What can we learn by looking at the natural history of sex?  \n<time>05:55</time> How is sex defined?  \n<time>15:53</time> Gender  \n<time>20:48</time> Is reproduction the only goal of sex?  \n<time>27:08</time> Homosexuality and same-sex behavior  \n<time>32:21</time> Monogamy and mating systems  \n<time>39:19</time> Trans people  \n<time>48:27</time> Where does prejudice against diversity stem from?  \n<time>52:30</time> A final message  \n<time>54:43</time> Follow Dr. Lents\u2019 work!\n\n---\n\nFollow Dr. Lents\u2019 work:  \nOur first interview: https://youtu.be/MMr202BtrLE  \nFaculty page: http://bit.ly/34lfuXz  \nResearchGate profile: http://bit.ly/2Wn4Nzb  \nThe Sexual Evolution: https://tinyurl.com/ya3kcffd  \nTwitter handle: @nathanlents\n",
