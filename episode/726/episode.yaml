shownotes: "RECORDED ON SEPTEMBER 21st 2022.  \nDr. Cristina Moya is Assistant Professor\
  \ of Anthropology at the University of California, Davis. She is an evolutionary\
  \ anthropologist interested in how humans respond adaptively to culturally structured\
  \ social worlds. Two main foci of her research are: intergroup interactions and\
  \ social cognition; and cross-cultural variation in social effects on reproduction.\n\
  \nIn this episode, we talk about ethnic categories, and social effects on reproduction.\
  \ We start by defining ethnic categories, and we talk about their evolutionary bases;\
  \ the fact that there is no correlation between \u201Crace\u201D and culture; stereotyping,\
  \ essentialism, and ethnocentrism; how people think about ethnic groups; child development;\
  \ and gene-culture coevolution in ethnic psychology. We then get into social effects\
  \ on reproduction, with a focus on the impact of family members. We discuss reproduction\
  \ in industrialized societies; religiosity; and female-dispersing groups, and age\
  \ at menopause. Finally, we talk about potential explanations for the demographic\
  \ transition in industrialized societies.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:00 Intro  \n00:39\
