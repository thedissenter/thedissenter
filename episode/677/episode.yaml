  \ reporting of adverse side effects. We ask if people generally need supplements.\
  \ We talk about botanicals used in traditional societies. We discuss issues with\
  \ the ingredients of supplements, and potential interactions with medication. We\
  \ talk about how we can know that a supplement is trustworthy. We go through several\
  \ communication issues regarding social media, celebrity influencers, anecdotes,\
  \ and the \u201Cwellness industry\u201D. We touch on pet supplements. Finally, we\
  \ talk about how to know if one has some deficiency, what to ask healthcare providers\
  \ about supplements, and how to monitor the effects of dietary supplements.\n\n\
