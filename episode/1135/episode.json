	"shownotes": "RECORDED ON JULY 1st 2025.  \nDr. Ian James Kidd is an Associate Professor at the Department of Philosophy at the University of Nottingham. Most of his current research concerns epistemology, virtues and vices, misanthropy (on which he is writing a book) and pessimism, and south and east Asian philosophies, especially Buddhism, Confucianism and Daoism.\n\nIn this episode, we talk about philosophical misanthropy. We first discuss what it is, the failing of humanity, and whether most people are decent. We then talk about the relationship between vices, corruption, and misanthropy; and religious and secular misanthropy. We discuss the different types of misanthropes: the activist, the enemy, the fugitive, and the quietist. Finally, we discuss if there could be a fifth type, who would simply embrace the evils of humanity, and how we can deal with humanity\u2019s malevolence without losing hope.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:27</time> What is philosophical misanthropy?  \n<time>07:24</time> The failings of humanity  \n<time>14:56</time> Are most people decent?  \n<time>20:59</time> The relationship between vices, corruption, and misanthropy  \n<time>28:25</time> Religious and secular misanthropy  \n<time>34:47</time> Types of misanthropes: the activist, the enemy, the fugitive, and the quietist  \n<time>50:17</time> How about just embracing the evils of humanity?  \n<time>52:16</time> How can we deal with humanity\u2019s malevolence without losing hope?  \n<time>56:28</time> Follow Dr. Kidd\u2019s work!\n\n---\n\nFollow Dr. Kidd\u2019s work:  \nFaculty page: https://tinyurl.com/3nnzf34v  \nWebsite: https://tinyurl.com/mrxv4n75  \nPhilPeople profile: https://tinyurl.com/mrbztbf3\n",
