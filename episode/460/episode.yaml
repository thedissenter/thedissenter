  \ Professor Emeritus at the University of New Mexico. His research interests include\
  \ social behavior; interpersonal relationships; social/personality psychology; psychopathology;\
  \ and health related behavior, as informed by Evolutionary Psychology.\n\nIn this\
  \ episode, we talk about ovulatory shifts, physical attractiveness, and psychological\
  \ adaptations and exaptations. We start with the ovulatory-shift hypothesis, and\
  \ the several controversies surrounding it, and what we know and do not know about\
  \ ovulation and its psychological effects on women. We talk about the evolution\
  \ of human physical attractiveness. Toward the end, we discuss the best way to understand\
  \ the evolution of phenotypic traits, and adaptationist and exaptationist programs.\
  \ Finally, we discuss the relationship between life history theory and evolutionary\
  \ psychology.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:00 Intro  \n00:35  The ovulatory-shift hypothesis\
