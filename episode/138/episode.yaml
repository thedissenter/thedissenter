  \ We talk about what is it; the hard problem of consciousness; illusionism; the\
  \ evolutionary origins and function of consciousness; how consciousness relates\
  \ to questions surrounding free will and determinism. Toward the end, we also discuss\
  \ a little bit if AI could spontaneously develop consciousness in any way, or if\
  \ we would need to program it into it. \n\nTime Links:  \n00:55  What is consciousness?\
