	"published": "2025-01-09",
	"shownotes": "RECORDED ON FEBRUARY 13th 2024.  \nDr. Rodolfo Dirzo is Associate Dean at the Doerr School of Sustainability, Bing Professor in Environmental Science, Professor of Earth System Science and Senior Fellow at the Woods Institute for the Environment at Stanford University. His scientific work examines the study of species interactions in tropical ecosystems from California, Latin America, and other tropical areas of the world. Recent research highlights the decline of animal life (\u201cdefaunation\u201d), and how this affects ecosystem processes/services (e.g. disease regulation).\n\nIn this episode, we first talk about species interactions, and the role they play in evolution. We also talk about hybrid networks, and how they can be disrupted by human activity. We discuss why biodiversity conservation is so important, and how climate change impacts animal populations. We then talk about mass extinctions, and we focus on the ongoing sixth mass extinction. Finally, we discuss the signs that the sixth mass extinction is the result of human activity, and how it can impact humans.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:58</time> What are species interactions, and what role do they play in evolution?  \n<time>10:29</time> Hybrid networks, and how they can be disrupted by human activity  \n<time>17:02</time> Why is biodiversity conservation important?  \n<time>22:02</time> How climate change impacts animal populations  \n<time>24:15</time> What is a mass extinction?
