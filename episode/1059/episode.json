	"shownotes": "RECORDED ON MARCH 11th 2024.  \nDr. Christopher Hoyt is an Associate Professor in the Department of Philosophy and Religion at Western Carolina University. His research interests include Wittgenstein, and the philosophy of film.\n\nIn this episode, we talk about Wittgenstein, philosophy of mind, and religion. We start by discussing Wittgenstein\u2019s philosophy, how it relates to philosophy of mind, and how he approached religion. We talk about rituals and meaning, language games and belief systems, and religious dogma. Finally, we discuss the cognitive science of religion; evolutionary theory, and religion as an adaptation; naturalizing religion; and whether there would be room for collaboration between the Wittgensteinians and the cognitive scientists of religion.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>01:01</time> Wittgenstein\u2019s philosophy  \n<time>09:24</time> Wittgenstein and philosophy of mind  \n<time>14:03</time> Wittgenstein on religion  \n<time>16:17</time> Rituals and meaning  \n<time>22:52</time> Language games and belief systems  \n<time>24:50</time> Religious dogma  \n<time>26:58</time> Cognitive science of religion  \n<time>29:00</time> Evolutionary theory, and religion as an adaptation  \n<time>37:29</time> Naturalizing religion  \n<time>41:35</time> Is there room for collaboration between the Wittgensteinians and the cognitive scientists of religion?  \n<time>45:53</time> Follow Dr. Hoyt\u2019s work!\n\n---\n\nFollow Dr. Hoyt\u2019s work:  \nFaculty page: https://bit.ly/3MNxm3e  \nResearchGate profile: https://bit.ly/3upJnFV\n",
