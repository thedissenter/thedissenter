shownotes: "THIS TIME, IT\u2019S AUDIO-ONLY. SORRY ABOUT THAT, BUT I HAD SOME SORT\
  \ OF TECHNICAL ISSUE, AND I COULDN\u2019T RECORD VIDEO. \n\nDr. Phoebe Ellsworth\
  \ is Frank Murphy Distinguished Professor of Law and Psychology, and Faculty Associate\
  \ at the ISR Research Center for Group Dynamics, at the University of Michigan,\

  \ done research on jury behavior and decision making, public opinion and the death\
