We first discuss what is a \u201cutopia\u201d, social experiments in the 18th and 19th centuries, and Pythagoras. We talk about family and gender roles, the cohousing movement in Denmark, the Israeli kibbutzim, matriarchal Colombian ecovillages, planned microdistricts in China, and monastic life. We also discuss the importance of education, communism, what we can learn by studying these societies, and the difficulties in implementing utopia.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:40</time> The premise of the book  \n<time>03:43</time> What is a \u201cutopia\u201d?  \n<time>05:59</time> Social experiments in the 18th and 19th centuries  \n<time>12:51</time> Pythagoras  \n<time>15:55</time> Family and gender roles  \n<time>20:13</time> The cohousing movement in Denmark  \n<time>32:24</time> The Israeli kibbutzim  \n<time>34:06</time> Matriarchal Colombian ecovillages  \n<time>36:51</time> Planned microdistricts in China    \n<time>40:36</time> Monastic life  \n<time>43:15</time> The importance of education  \n<time>53:43</time> Communism  \n<time>58:56</time> What we can learn by studying these societies  \n<time>1:01:10</time> The difficulties in implementing utopia  \n1:08.41  Follow Dr. Ghodsee\u2019s work!\n\n---\n\nFollow Dr. Ghodsee\u2019s work:  \nFaculty page: https://tinyurl.com/28w7hm52  \nWebsite: https://kristenghodsee.com/  \nEveryday Utopia: https://tinyurl.com/5n937b45\n",
