  \ Philosophy at The University of Texas at Austin. She is interested in philosophy\
  \ of mind and metaphysics. Dr. Montague is the editor of Non-Propositional Intentionality,\
  \ Cognitive Phenomenology, and Philosophical Writings by P.F. Strawson (co-edited\

  \nIn this episode, we talk about philosophy of mind, with a focus on The Given.\
  \ We go through several different concepts, like mental content, intentionality,\
  \ and phenomenology. We discuss cognition, perception and sensory experience, and\
  \ the relationship between them. We talk about the nature of consciousness. And\
  \ we discuss the relationship between mind and metaphysics, the metaphysics of mental\
  \ phenomena, the access we have to reality, and the metaphysical nature of reality.\n\
