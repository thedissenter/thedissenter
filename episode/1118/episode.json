	"shownotes": "RECORDED ON APRIL 24th 2025.  \nDr. Peter Adamson is Professor of Philosophy at the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich and at King's College London. He has written articles, monographs and edited books, mostly on philosophy in the Islamic world and ancient philosophy. He is the host of the weekly podcast \"History of Philosophy without any gaps\". He is the author of several books, including Heirs of Avicenna: Philosophy in the Islamic East, 12-13th Centuries.\n\nIn this episode, we focus on Heirs of Avicenna. We start by talking about Avicenna and his main contributions to philosophy, the relationship between philosophy in the Islamic East and the scholastic tradition in Europe, the relationship between Avicenna and the traditions of falsafa and kalam, and how the book was organized. We focus on the topics of metaphysics in the Islamic East, and the issues that best characterize the philosophy of the Islamic East. We discuss whether the thinkers from this time period were philosophers of \u201cparaphilosophers\u201d. We talk about the most prominent philosophers, including al-Suhraward\u012b, Ab\u016b al-Barak\u0101t al-Baghd\u0101d\u012b, Fakhr al-D\u012bn al-R\u0101z\u012b, and al-\u1e6c\u016bs\u012b, as well as their legacy. Finally, we discuss what we can learn from studying philosophy beyond Europe.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:42</time> Avicenna and his contributions to philosophy  \n<time>09:41</time> Philosophy in the Islamic East and the scholastic tradition in Europe  \n<time>11:53</time> Avicenna and the traditions of falsafa and kalam  \n<time>20:24</time> How the book was organized  \n<time>27:33</time> Metaphysics in the Islamic East  \n<time>32:39</time> The issues that best characterize the philosophy of the Islamic East  \n<time>42:54</time> Were they philosophers of \u201cparaphilosophers\u201d?  \n<time>47:24</time> The most prominent philosophers: al-Suhraward\u012b, Ab\u016b al-Barak\u0101t al-Baghd\u0101d\u012b, Fakhr al-D\u012bn al-R\u0101z\u012b, and al-\u1e6c\u016bs\u012b  \n<time>55:57</time> Their legacy  \n<time>1:00:26</time> Studying philosophy beyond Europe  \n<time>1:04:08</time> Follow Dr. Adamson\u2019s work!\n\n---\n\nFollow Dr. Adamson\u2019s work:  \nOur first interview: https://youtu.be/KFWWSB4u8zs  \nFaculty Page (Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich): https://bit.ly/2EhahTz  \nResearchGate profile: https://bit.ly/2EigOxn  \nHistory of Philosophy without any gaps podcast: https://bit.ly/2ladbAX  \nBooks: https://bit.ly/2NiHgOc  \nTwitter handle: @HistPhilosophy\n",
