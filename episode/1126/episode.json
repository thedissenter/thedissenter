She is also the founder of Liberos LLC, an independent research institute.\n\nIn this episode, we first discuss whether pornography is a superstimulus, whether pornography changes sex scripts, the personality of porn users, and who the people who condemn porn the most are. We also discuss whether there is such a thing as dopamine addiction and dopamine detox. We talk about problematic porn use. We discuss NoFap groups and their claims, with a focus on semen retention.
