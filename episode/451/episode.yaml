shownotes: "RECORDED ON MARCH 18th 2021.  \nDr. Nicole Barbaro is Educational Research\
  \ Scientist for WGU Labs, an Adjunct Professor at Utah Valley University, and the\
  \ Communications Officer for the Human Behavior and Evolution Society. Her interests\
  \ are in human sexual psychology and behavior, including application of life history\
  \ theory and sperm competition theory.\n\nIn this episode, we focus on attachment\
  \ theory and behavioral genetics. We dissect attachment theory, going through topics\
  \ like the different attachment styles; their relationship with personality; what\
  \ we know about the behavioral genetics of attachment; the shared and the non-shared\
  \ environment; the evolution of attachment; and environment unpredictability. We\
  \ discuss the relationship between anxious attachment and intimate partner violence.\
  \ We talk about a recent paper on the effects of spanking on psychosocial outcomes.\
  \ Finally, we discuss the relationship between behavioral genetics and evolutionary\
  \ psychology, and we end with a question from a patron of the show.\n\nTime Links:\
