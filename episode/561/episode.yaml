  \ in the Anthropology department at University of Colorado Denver. Her research\
  \ focuses on the evolution of the human musculoskeletal system using biomechanical\
  \ techniques to assess how variation in physical structure affects locomotor performance.\
  \ She is specifically interested in the human pelvis and how its unique anatomy\
  \ impacts both locomotion and human birth. Dr. Warrener\u2019s research has been\
  \ published in PNAS, PLOS ONE, The Anatomical Record and other peer-reviewed journals\
  \ and has also been featured in the BBC documentary \u201CWhat Makes Us Human\u201D\
  \ and on NPR.\n\nIn this episode, we talk about human bipedalism, the human pelvis,\
  \ and childbirth. We start by talking about the major steps we took to evolve our\
  \ modern human anatomy, starting with our last common ancestor with chimps and bonobos.\
  \ We discuss how our pelvis had to evolve for us to become bipedal. We go through\
  \ the major hypothesis out there to explain the evolution of human bipedalism. We\
  \ discuss the relationship between human life history, brain size, and the evolution\
  \ of the female pelvis. We ask to what extent childbirth for human females is problematic\
  \ from an evolutionary perspective. We talk about sex differences on the level of\
  \ the pelvis. We also talk about human altriciality, and timing of birth.\n\nTime\
