	"shownotes": "RECORDED ON FEBRUARY 20th 2024.  \nDr. Azim Shariff is Professor and Canada Research Chair at the University of British Columbia, Canada. He is a social psychologist whose research focuses on where morality intersects with religion, cultural attitudes and economics. Another rapidly expanding part of his research looks at human-technology interactions and the ethics of automation, including self-driving cars.\n\nIn this episode, we start by talking about cultural differences between East Asia and North America in how people react to robots, algorithms, and AI. We talk about the example of robot preachers and credibility enhancing displays. We discuss people\u2019s belief in free will, and how it varies according to the situation and some individual traits. We discuss whether people always follow their own self-interest in politics. We talk about why people in the US love rags-to-riches stories, and whether people who became rich or the born rich support social welfare more. Finally, we discuss the phenomenon of moralization of effort, and what displays of effort signal socially.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>03:03</time> Cultural differences in how people react to robots and AI  \n<time>10:47</time> Robot preachers and credibility  \n<time>20:23</time> How the degree to which people believe in free will varies  \n<time>27:16</time> Do people\u2019s belief in free will have any bearing on the existence of free will?  \n<time>29:26</time> Do people follow their own self-interest in politics?  \n<time>36:22</time> Why people love rags-to-riches stories  \n<time>42:23</time> People who became rich, the born rich, and support for social welfare  \n<time>46:23</time> The moralization of effort, and what displays of effort signal  \n<time>1:00:02</time> Follow Dr. Shariff\u2019s work!\n\n---\n\nFollow Dr. Shariff\u2019s work:  \nOur first interview: https://youtu.be/mjWveAPPoSk  \nFaculty page: https://bit.ly/2U4Xj4b  \nResearchGate profile: https://bit.ly/2NCo2PZ  \nTwitter handle: @azimshariff\n",
