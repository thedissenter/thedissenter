First, Dr. Haier explains what psychometrics is about, and how and why we can reliably measure psychological traits. Then, we discuss what intelligence is, the relationship between general intelligence, the g factor and IQ; the limitations of IQ testing; the correlation between IQ and life outcomes; genetic and environmental factors in IQ. We also refer to the neuroscience of intelligence, and the aspects of the brain that go associated with IQ. We also get into controversial aspects of intelligence research, like sex differences and race differences. We finish up by talking about the differences between human general intelligence and artificial intelligence, and the impact that these systems might have in society.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>01:10</time> Psychometrics, and measuring psychological traits  \n<time>05:19</time> What is intelligence?                                 \n<time>13:14</time> The limitations of IQ testing                                 \n<time>23:48</time> IQ and life outcomes                                 \n<time>28:40</time> Genetics and the environment                               \n<time>43:56</time> About genetic engineering                           \n<time>46:04</time> Intelligence and the brain                \n<time>52:29</time> Sex differences, race differences, and other group differences              \n<time>1:11:30</time> Studying differences it not the same thing as saying that some people are better than others  \n<time>1:16:23</time> General intelligence and artificial intelligence    \n<time>1:21:02</time> Follow Dr. Haier’s work!\n\n---\n\nFollow Dr. Haier’s work:  \nFaculty page: https://bit.ly/2OD0BGY  \nWebsite: http://www.richardhaier.com/   \nArticles on Researchgate: https://bit.ly/2SzQEdx  \nTwitter handle: @rjhaier  \nThe Neuroscience of Intelligence: https://amzn.to/2WB2feZ\n",
