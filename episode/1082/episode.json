	"shownotes": "RECORDED ON FEBRUARY 11th 2025.  \nDr. Wade Allison is Emeritus Professor in the Department of Physics at the University of Oxford. He is the author of books like Nuclear is for Life: A Cultural Revolution, Radiation and Reason: The Impact of Science on a Culture of Fear, and Fundamental Physics for Probing and Imaging.\n\nIn this episode, we talk about nuclear energy. We start by discussing the link between energy and life, and four energy revolutions that occurred on Earth. We then get specifically into nuclear energy, and talk about what it is, whether there is a link between nuclear energy and nuclear weapons, the accidents of Chernobyl and Fukushima, the risks of ionizing radiation, the pros and cons of renewable energy and nuclear energy, how we deal with nuclear waste, and common misconceptions surrounding nuclear energy. We also discuss why some environmentalists are against nuclear energy, the consequences of not using nuclear energy or moving away from it, and how we can rehabilitate the way people think about nuclear energy.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:42</time> Energy and life, and the four energy revolutions  \n<time>10:52</time> The importance of energy for human society  \n<time>14:31</time> What is nuclear energy?  \n<time>21:31</time> Is there a link between nuclear energy and nuclear weapons?  \n<time>24:30</time> Chernobyl and Fukushima  \n<time>29:53</time> The risks of ionizing radiation  \n<time>34:06</time> The pros and cons of renewable energy and nuclear energy  \n<time>42:49</time> Nuclear waste  \n<time>47:04</time> Misconceptions surrounding nuclear energy  \n<time>51:08</time> Environmentalists against nuclear energy  \n<time>53:47</time> Not using nuclear energy or moving away from it  \n<time>57:41</time> Rehabilitating the way people think about nuclear energy\n\n---\n\nFollow Dr. Allison\u2019s work:  \nFaculty page: https://tinyurl.com/33wbm5k4  \nResearchGate profile: https://tinyurl.com/4wm77at6  \nBooks on Amazon: https://tinyurl.com/95va4tm7  \nX handle: @radiationreason\n",
