	"published": "2024-11-21",
	"shownotes": "RECORDED ON OCTOBER 14th 2024.  \nDr. Vivek Venkataraman is Assistant Professor in the Department of Anthropology and Archaeology at the University of Calgary. He is an evolutionary anthropologist who is broadly interested in the evolution of the human diet and food systems, and their relation to life history and behavior. He is assistant director of the Guassa Gelada Research Project, and also the co-founder and co-PI of the Orang Asli Health and Lifeways Project (OAHeLP).\n\nIn this episode, we first talk about human tree climbing, its functions, how good we are at it, and whether bipedalism had a negative impact on it. We then discuss different running techniques across human societies, and the influence of footwear or running barefoot. We talk about the determinants of reproductive success in non-industrial societies, before discussing hunting; the idea of \u201cMan the Hunter\u201d; when and how women hunt; cultural restrictions on female hunting; the issues with some studies on female hunting, as well as their merits. We also talk about sexual divisions of labor.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:26</time> Human tree climbing  \n<time>17:49</time> Bipedalism and tree climbing  \n<time>20:20</time> Different running techniques across human societies  \n<time>28:46</time> Footwear and running techniques  \n<time>34:51</time> The determinants of reproductive success in non-industrial societies  \n<time>42:20</time> Hunting in human societies  \n<time>49:36</time> Man the Hunter  \n<time>56:06</time> When and how women hunt  \n<time>1:02:40</time> Cultural restrictions on female hunting  \n<time>1:07:32</time> Issues with studies on female hunting  \n<time>1:15:12</time> The positive aspects of studying female hunting  \n<time>1:23:04</time> Sexual divisions of labor  \n<time>1:24:17</time> Follow Dr. Venkataraman\u2019s work!\n\n---\n\nFollow Dr. Venkataraman\u2019s work:  \nFaculty page: https://tinyurl.com/dcrmsfwa  \nWebsite: https://shorturl.at/7i8HP  \nGoogle Scholar page: https://shorturl.at/j5tU1  \nTwitter handle: @vivek_vasi\n",
