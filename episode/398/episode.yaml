excerpt: 'Dr. Stuart Russell is a Professor of Computer Science at the University
  of California, Berkeley, where he also holds the Smith-Zadeh Chair in Engineering.
  He founded and leads the Center for Human-Compatible Artificial Intelligence there.
  His research covers a wide range of topics in artificial intelligence including
  machine learning, probabilistic reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, real-time
  decision making, multitarget tracking, computer vision, computational physiology,
  global seismic monitoring, and philosophical foundations. His current concerns include
  the threat of autonomous weapons and the long-term future of artificial intelligence
  and its relation to humanity. Dr. Russell is co-author of the most popular textbook

  \ Computer Science at the University of California, Berkeley, where he also holds\
  \ the Smith-Zadeh Chair in Engineering. He founded and leads the Center for Human-Compatible\
  \ Artificial Intelligence there. His research covers a wide range of topics in artificial\
  \ intelligence including machine learning, probabilistic reasoning, knowledge representation,\
  \ planning, real-time decision making, multitarget tracking, computer vision, computational\

  \ Intelligence: A Modern Approach used in more than 1,400 universities in 128 countries.\
  \ His most recent book is Human Compatible: Artificial Intelligence and the Problem\
  \ of Control.\n\nIn this episode, we talk about artificial intelligence. We start\
  \ with what intelligence is, and what would human-level AI look like. We get into\
  \ what is worrisome about advanced AI systems, and the issue with value alignment.\
  \ We discuss different instances where AI is already impacting our lives, and where\
  \ it will progress in the future, including the impact it will have on the job market.\
  \ We also talk about possible solutions, and if we should be worried about how we\
  \ treat AI systems.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:49  What is intelligence?  \n02:28  Human-level\
  \ AI  \n05:00  Should we be worrying about AI?  \n11:50  Should the goals of AI\
  \ be aligned with ours?  \n17:17  Can we program moral values into AI systems? \
  \ \n22:11  Can we simply switch AI off?  \n24:44  AI and the job market  \n29:20\
  \  Are researchers worried enough about the possible negative consequences of AI?\
  \  \n32:17  Human enhancement, and merging with AI  \n33:32  Governance of AI  \n\
  35:19  How should we treat AI systems?  \n39:35  Solutions  \n46:11  Can we be optimistic\
  \ about the future?  \n48:04  Follow Russell\u2019s work!\n\n---\n\nFollow Dr. Russell\u2019\
