	"shownotes": "RECORDED ON NOVEMBER 26th 2024.  \nDr. Daniel Hoyer is Senior Research Associate & Managing Director for Seshat: Global History Databank, Research Scientist with the SocialAI Research Group, and Founder of SODY. He is the author of Figuring Out The Past: The 3,495 Vital Statistics that Explain World History.\n\nIn this episode, we talk about cliodynamics, the use of science, data and maths to study history. We first discuss what it is and how it works, and how it applies to debates like the Big Man vs. Big Ideas debate and whether history repeats itself. We then get into the phenomenon of inequality and elite overproduction. We discuss whether inequality is inevitable; competition, social unrest, and revolution; and how revolutions can be prevented. We talk about why we live in an age of polycrisis, and possible solutions to it.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:42</time> What is cliodynamics?  \n<time>06:11</time> The Big Man vs Big Ideas debate  \n<time>12:04</time> Does history repeat itself?  \n<time>16:58</time> Inequality and elite overproduction  \n<time>26:44</time> Is inequality inevitable?  \n<time>33:52</time> Competition, social unrest, and revolution  \n<time>45:50</time> How to prevent revolution  \n<time>53:20</time> We live in an age of polycrisis  \n<time>1:02:57</time> Solutions  \n<time>1:07:04</time> Follow Dr. Hoyer\u2019s work!\n\n---\n\nFollow Dr. Hoyer\u2019s work:  \nOur first interview: https://youtu.be/7rYD5CBtIwc  \nResearchGate profile: https://bit.ly/3mwCD0R  \nSheshat: https://bit.ly/3wCihYJ  \nAmazon page: https://amzn.to/31XTWhY  \nFiguring Out The Past: https://amzn.to/3t4RMJf  \nTwitter handle: @hoyerdan\n",
