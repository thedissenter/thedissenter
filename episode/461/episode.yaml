shownotes: "RECORDED ON APRIL 20th 2021.  \nDr. David Buss is a Professor of Psychology\
  \ at the University of Texas at Austin. He\u2019s one of the founders of the field\
  \ of evolutionary psychology. His primary research focus is on strategies of human\
  \ mating. He\u2019s the author of many books, including The Evolution of Desire,\
  \ and the first textbook in Evolutionary Psychology, Evolutionary Psychology: The\
  \ New Science of the Mind. His most recent book is When Men Behave Badly: The Hidden\
  \ Roots of Sexual Deception, Harassment, and Assault.\n\nIn this episode, we focus\
  \ on When Men Behave Badly. We first discuss what sexual conflict is, from an evolutionary\
  \ perspective, and the evolutionary roots of behaviors like sexual deception, harassment\
  \ and assault. We refer to sociocultural perspectives about sexual conflict, and\
  \ how they complement evolutionary psychology. Throughout the interview, we touch\
  \ on rape, mate guarding behavior, and mate value discrepancies and their effects.\
  \ We also talk about evolutionary mismatches in sexual conflict. We touch on possible\
  \ evolutionary explanations for the #metoo movement and the incel movement. Finally,\
  \ we discuss possible strategies to prevent sexual violence, and also ask if people\
  \ can use evolutionary psychology to improve their relationship satisfaction.\n\n\
