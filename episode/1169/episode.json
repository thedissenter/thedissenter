	"shownotes": "RECORDED ON JULY 24th 2025.  \nDr. Gabriel Zamosc-Regueros is Associate Professor of Philosophy in the College of Liberal Arts and Science at the University of Colorado, Denver. His areas of expertise include ethics, Nietzsche, 19th-20th century continental philosophy, and philosophy of Action.\n\nIn this episode, we talk about three of Nietzsche\u2019s ideals: becoming what one is, sovereignty, and wholeness. We start with the ideal of becoming what one is: what it is, what one's own uniqueness is, Nitzsche\u2019s takes on the drives and free will, and the mechanisms to become what one is. We then talk about sovereignty: what a morally responsible agent is, and the role of moral guilt. We also discuss wholeness: what it is, and social integration. Finally, we talk about the pathos of distance and aristocracy, and whether it is compatible with democracy.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:38</time> Nietzsche\u2019s ideals: becoming what one is  \n<time>57:47</time> Sovereignty  \n<time>1:09:54</time> Wholeness  \n<time>1:20:06</time> The pathos of distance, aristocracy, and democracy  \n<time>1:38:42</time> Follow Dr. Zamosc-Regueros\u2019 work!\n\n---\n\nFollow Dr. Zamosc-Regueros\u2019 work:  \nFaculty page: https://shorturl.at/kuh0e  \nPhilpeople profile: https://shorturl.at/AqTHM\n",
