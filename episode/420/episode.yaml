  \n\nIn this episode, we talk about life history theory, and evolutionary medicine.\
  \ We discuss life history theory extensively, including how it links ecology to\
  \ evolutionary biology, and r/K-selection. We talk about individual variation in\
  \ life history strategies, phenotypic plasticity, and culture. We then get into\
  \ evolutionary medicine, where we talk about evolutionary mismatch and diseases\
  \ of the modern world, and evolutionary public health. We end with a question from\
  \ a patron.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:38  Life history theory, and how it connects ecology\
