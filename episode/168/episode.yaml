  \ the Science of Human Behavior Can Improve Our Lives and Our World.\n\nIn this\
  \ episode, we focus on some of the main topics of Dr. Biglan\u2019s book, The Nurture\
  \ Effect. We refer to the role of evolution in the behavioral sciences, and to aspects\
  \ of the environment from families to schools and societies, and the negative effects\
  \ of coercive environments. We also discuss specifically addictive behaviors involving\
  \ tobacco, alcohol and drugs, risky sexual behavior, and anti-social behavior. In\
  \ the latter part of the interview, we also talk about cultural evolution, psychological\
  \ flexibility, and their relationship to the development of nurturing societies.\n\
