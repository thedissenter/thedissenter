  \ about animal ethics. First, we focus on the biological bases of morality and their\
  \ importance to animal ethics, and some aspects of animal psychology that might\
  \ be particularly relevant to the discussion, like consciousness and empathy. In\
  \ the second part of the interview, we talk about specific topics, like animal research\
  \ and testing in science, animal conservation in zoos and aquaria, and the food\
  \ industry and veganism. Finally, Dr. Pierce gives us an overview of the research\
  \ she is doing with Dr. Marc Bekoff for a new book, that is tentatively titled \u201C\
  A Dogs\u2019 World\u201D, and also a short teaser to a book that she will release\
  \ next month, \u201CUnleashing Your Dog\u201D. \n\nTime Links:  \n<time>01:20</time>\
