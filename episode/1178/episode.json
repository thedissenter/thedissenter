Her work has appeared in leading publications such as Nature and Science. She is the author of Intraterrestrials: Discovering the Strangest Life on Earth.\n\nIn this episode, we focus on Intraterrestrials. We first discuss what intraterrestrials are and how they live. We talk about how they change our conceptions of life, and their presence in methane seeps, permafrost, active volcanoes, boiling water, and other places. We also talk about how they can live for thousands of years, what they tell us about the origins of life on Earth, the limits for life, and their applications for human life. Finally, we discuss the future of life on Earth, and the kinds of life we might find on other planets.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:29</time> Intraterrestrials and how they live  \n<time>09:59</time> How they change our conceptions of life  \n<time>13:05</time> Intraterrestrials in methane seeps, permafrost, active volcanoes, boiling water, etc.  \n<time>18:38</time> How they can live for thousands of years  \n<time>22:42</time> The origins of life on Earth  \n<time>25:05</time> The limits for life  \n<time>27:36</time> The applications of intraterrestrials  \n<time>30:02</time> The future of life on Earth  \n<time>31:24</time> Life on other planets  \n<time>33:07</time> Follow Dr. Lloyd\u2019s work!\n\n---\n\nFollow Dr. Lloyd\u2019s work:  \nFaculty page: https://tinyurl.com/5auxn2nm  \nIntraterrestrials: https://tinyurl.com/mu2ufu4w  \nX handle: @archaearama\n",
