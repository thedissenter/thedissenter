	"shownotes": "RECORDED ON MARCH 5th 2024.  \nDr. Joseph LeDoux is the Henry and Lucy Moses Professor of Science, Professor of Neural Science, Professor of Psychiatry, and Professor of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry at New York University. His work is focused on the brain mechanisms of emotion and memory. He\u2019s the author of many books, the most recent one being The Four Realms of Existence: A New Theory of Being Human.\n\nIn this episode, we focus on The Four Realms of Existence. We talk about the idea of mind-brain dualism. We go through Dr. LeDoux\u2019s work on split-brain patients, emotion, and cognition. We talk about the four realms of existence (bodily, neural, cognitive, and conscious), and how they relate to one another. We discuss how we go from the cognitive realm to the conscious realm, how to understand consciousness, and the different kinds of consciousness. Finally, we discuss how ideas like the self are barriers to discovery and understanding, and how we have hit an epistemological wall.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:36</time> The idea of mind-body dualism  \n<time>03:51</time> Dr. LeDoux\u2019s work on split-brain patients, emotion, and cognition  \n<time>31:52</time> The four realms of existence: bodily, neural, cognitive, and conscious  \n<time>43:53</time> Understanding consciousness  \n<time>55:53</time> Ideas like the self as epistemological walls  \n<time>59:28</time> Follow Dr. LeDoux\u2019s work!\n\n---\n\nFollow Dr. LeDoux\u2019s work:  \nOur first interview: https://youtu.be/TzhqTRtHx8w  \nUniversity website: https://bit.ly/34zIf1X  \nPersonal website: http://bit.ly/2sjuZzv  \nBooks on Amazon: https://amzn.to/3nsP6Tn  \nThe Four Realms of Existence: https://bit.ly/41CClKA  \nTwitter handle: @theamygdaloid\n",
