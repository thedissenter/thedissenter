She is coauthor of The Nocebo Effect: When Words Make You Sick.\n\nIn this episode, we focus on The Nocebo Effect. We start by talking about the placebo effect and the nocebo effect. We discuss how the nocebo effect is produced psychologically, whether it is \u201call in the head\u201d, how it is produced in a clinical context, how to distinguish between \u201creal\u201d side effects of treatments and nocebo effects, and whether words can produce harm. We also discuss whether psychotherapy is mostly placebo. Finally, we talk about the side effects and nocebo effects of the COVID-19 vaccine, nocebo effects in public health and medical ethics, and how to reduce the nocebo effect.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:39</time> The placebo effect  \n<time>04:47</time> The nocebo effect  \n<time>11:20</time> How the nocebo effect is produced psychologically  \n<time>14:53</time> Are nocebo effects \u201call in the head\u201d?  \n<time>17:38</time> How it is produced in a clinical context  \n<time>24:56</time> Distinguishing \u201creal\u201d side effects of treatments from nocebo effects  \n<time>33:05</time> Can words produce harm?  \n<time>37:32</time> Is psychotherapy placebo?  \n<time>47:21</time> The COVID-19 vaccine  \n<time>56:34</time> Nocebo effects in public health and medical ethics  \n<time>1:02:43</time> How to reduce the nocebo effect  \n<time>1:10:03</time> Follow Dr. Blease\u2019s work!\n\n---\n\nFollow Dr. Blease\u2019s work:  \nUniversity page: https://bit.ly/3SKZtm3  \nWebsite: https://bit.ly/3T1elho  \nWorks on PhilPeople: https://bit.ly/3T1J26f  \nThe Nocebo Effect: https://bit.ly/3SWXImZ  \nTwitter handle: @crblease\n",
