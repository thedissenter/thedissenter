	"shownotes": "RECORDED ON DECEMBER 11th 2024.  \nDr. Michael Levin is Distinguished Professor in the Biology Department and Vannevar Bush Chair, as well as director of the Tufts Center for Regenerative and Developmental Biology at Tufts University. His work is focused on understanding the biophysical mechanisms that implement decision-making during complex pattern regulation, and harnessing endogenous bioelectric dynamics toward rational control of growth and form.\n\nIn this episode, we go through topics like living systems; self; planaria; morphology; cognition, and collective intelligence; multiscale competency; mind and sentience; regenerative medicine; cancer; and life after death.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:36</time> Living systems  \n<time>02:13</time> Self  \n<time>03:42</time> Planaria  \n<time>07:53</time> Morphology  \n<time>11:00</time> Cognition, and collective intelligence  \n<time>20:26</time> Multiscale competency  \n<time>26:03</time> Mind and sentience  \n<time>36:04</time> Regenerative medicine  \n<time>39:15</time> Cancer  \n<time>43:20</time> Causation in biology  \n<time>46:05</time> Life after death  \n<time>54:24</time> Follow Dr. Levin\u2019s work!\n\n---\n\nFollow Dr. Levin\u2019s work:  \nFaculty page: https://shorturl.at/SBEQH  \nWebsite: https://shorturl.at/5SH2w  \nResearchGate profile: https://shorturl.at/uf7gb  \nTwitter handle: @drmichaellevin\n",
