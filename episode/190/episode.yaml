shownotes: "Dr. Phillip Kavanagh is an Associate Professor of Evolutionary Psychology\
  \ at the Institute for Social Neuroscience, and Adjunct Associate Professor of Psychology\
  \ at the University of South Australia. Dr. Kavanagh lectures across both the undergraduate\
  \ and postgraduate psychology programs, provides research supervision to honors,\
  \ master's, and PhD students, and clinical supervision to students in the clinical\
  \ program.\n\nIn this episode, we talk about the relationship between evolutionary\
  \ psychology and clinical psychology, and the discipline of evolutionary clinical\
  \ psychology. We go through some major issues, like how to properly classify something\
  \ as a mental disorder/disease; how our modern environments differ in significant\
  \ ways from the environments we evolved in, and the problems that brings, and the\
  \ phenomenon of evolutionary mismatch; the several different schools of thought\
  \ that we have in clinical psychology, and if it would be possible to unify them\
  \ under a core theory; the difficulties in objectively evaluating patients; life\
  \ history strategies, and the problems that arise when we have unfulfilled expectations.\
  \ We also talk about personality variation, and the relevance of personality inventories,\
  \ like the Big Five, in a clinical context; the sociometer theory, and its explanatory\
  \ power; how our modern obsession with happiness might be problematic. Finally,\
  \ we discuss recent literature on the Dark Triad and the Light Triad of human nature.\n\
