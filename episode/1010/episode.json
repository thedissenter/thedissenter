	"published": "2024-10-24",
	"shownotes": "RECORDED ON MAY 2nd 2024.  \nDr. Michael Price is Senior Lecturer in Psychology at Brunel University London. His past research has focused mainly on evolutionary moral psychology. More recently, his primary research interests have been the biological and biocultural evolution of religio-spirituality, and \u201cUniversal Darwinism\u201d, which investigates the anti-entropic, creative power of Darwinian selection across all natural domains, from physics to biology to culture.\n\nIn this episode, we focus on religion from an evolutionary perspective. We talk about meaning-making in science and religion, the adaptive bases of religion and the cultural evolution of science, religio-spirituality as a biocultural phenomenon, the benefits of religion, and whether we can have secular societies with the same sorts of benefits. We also discuss the idea of Universal Darwinism and antientropic processes, and whether we can derive moral values from evolutionary theory.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:32</time> Religion from an evolutionary perspective  \n<time>02:58</time> Meaning-making in science and religion  \n<time>11:24</time> The evolution of science and religion  \n<time>19:45</time> Religio-spirituality as a biocultural phenomenon  \n<time>25:08</time> The benefits of religion  \n<time>29:30</time> Can we do without religion?  \n<time>36:21</time> Universal Darwinism, and antientropic processes  \n<time>45:32</time> Can we derive moral values from evolutionary theory?  \n<time>51:07</time> Dr. Price\u2019s current work on religio-spirituality  \n<time>54:54</time> Follow Dr. Price\u2019s work!\n\n---\n\nFollow Dr. Price\u2019s work:  \nFaculty page: https://bit.ly/4aTjtuW  \nResearchGate profile: https://bit.ly/4209UWR\n",
