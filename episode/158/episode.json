excerpt: Dr. Jay Belsky is Robert and Natalie Read Dorne Professor of Human Development
  in the Department of Human Ecology and Program in Human Development at the University
  of California, Davis. Professor Belsky is an internationally recognized expert in
  the field of child development and family studies. His areas of expertise include
  the effects of day care, parent-child relations during the infancy and early childhood
  years (including attachment), the transition to parenthood, the etiology of child
  maltreatment and the evolutionary basis of parent and child functioning. Dr. Belsky's
  research is marked by a focus upon fathers as well as mothers, marriages as well
  as parent-child relations, and naturalistic home observations of family interaction
  patterns. He is a founding and collaborating investigator on the NICHD Study of

  \ attachment theory. We start off by talking about the evolutionary and ecological\
  \ bases of parent-offspring relationships, including parent-offspring conflict,\
  \ and the different evolved strategies of attachment. We also discuss modern attachment\
  \ theory, and the main differences between it and classical attachment theory as\
  \ developed first by John Bowlby, how it relates to life history theory, and the\
  \ several different attachment styles that we have, including secure/autonomous,\
  \ avoidant/dismissing, resistant/preoccupied, and disorganized. In the second part\
  \ of the interview we also refer to parent-offspring conflict and child maltreatment;\
  \ the risks and benefits of daycare; and differential susceptibility in children\
  \ to different life circumstances during their development and different parenting\
  \ styles.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>01:22</time> The evolutionary bases of parent-offspring\
