	"shownotes": "RECORDED ON APRIL 3rd 2024.  \nDr. Timothy Weaver is a Professor in the Department of Anthropology at the University of California, Davis. Dr. Weaver studies human evolution, with a focus on the origins, evolution, and disappearance of Neandertals, and the related topic of the origins of humans who were anatomically and behaviorally modern. While his emphasis is on the later phases of human evolution, he has also worked on earlier periods, mostly in the context of the evolution of human bipedal walking and running and childbirth.\n\nIn this episode, we start by talking about the evolution of the human cranium, and we go through a timeline from the last common ancestor with chimpanzees to H. sapiens. We discuss the factors that played a role in the evolution of the human cranium, and how the evolution of the cranium related to bipedalism and childbirth. We then talk about the origins and migrations of Neanderthals, contact and interbreeding between Neanderthals and H. sapiens, differences in the cranium between Neanderthals and H. sapiens, and how Neanderthals went extinct. Finally, we talk about changes in the cranium across the agricultural transition.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:44</time> A timeline for the evolution of the human cranium  \n<time>10:01</time> From H. erectus to H. sapiens  \n<time>19:06</time> Factors that played a role in the evolution of the human cranium  \n<time>26:13</time> Bipedalism and childbirth  \n<time>31:10</time> The origins and migrations of Neanderthals  \n<time>38:30</time> Neanderthals getting in contact with H. sapiens  \n<time>49:42</time> Differences in the cranium between Neanderthals and H. sapiens  \n<time>56:01</time> How did the Neanderthals go extinct?  \n<time>1:07:29</time> What are modern humans?  \n<time>1:17:17</time> Changes in the cranium across the agricultural transition  \n<time>1:25:47</time> Follow Dr. Weaver\u2019s work!\n\n---\n\nFollow Dr. Weaver\u2019s work:  \nFaculty page: https://bit.ly/41y6evi  \nResearchGate profile: https://bit.ly/3RDPRsu\n",
