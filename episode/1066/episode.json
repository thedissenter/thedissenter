	"shownotes": "RECORDED ON DECEMBER 18th 2024.  \nDr. Karl Friston is Professor of Imaging Neuroscience and Wellcome Principal Research Fellow of Imaging Neuroscience at University College London. Dr. Friston is a theoretical neuroscientist and authority on brain imaging. He invented statistical parametric mapping (SPM), voxel-based morphometry (VBM) and dynamic causal modelling (DCM). His main contribution to theoretical neurobiology is a free-energy principle for action and perception. He is the author of several books, including Active Inference: The Free Energy Principle in Mind, Brain, and Behavior.\n\nIn this episode, we first talk about a Free Energy perspective of culture. We discuss 4E cognition, and AI. We talk about how the Free Energy principle relates to quantum mechanics and general relativity. We discuss whether Free Energy can be a theory of everything. Finally, we talk about a new understanding of death.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:35</time> The Free Energy Principle and culture  \n<time>09:32</time> 4E Cognition  \n<time>11:45</time> AI  \n<time>15:09</time> How the Free Energy principle relates to quantum mechanics and general relativity  \n<time>25:12</time> Can Free Energy be a theory of everything?  \n<time>30:35</time> Death  \n<time>35:28</time> Follow Dr. Friston\u2019s work!\n\n---\n\nFollow Dr. Friston\u2019s work:  \nFaculty page: https://tinyurl.com/38wwsbun  \nResearchGate profile: https://tinyurl.com/ycy7sbf7  \nBooks on Amazon: https://tinyurl.com/5mua5hxy\n",
