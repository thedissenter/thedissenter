We start by talking about American meritocracy, and where the ideas associated with it came from. We discuss whether anyone is ever self-reliant. We talk about how people tend to get rich. We discuss neoliberalism and the rise of hustle culture. We talk about the example of France, as a country with another type of work culture. We discuss whether we should tell people that hard work pays off. Finally, we talk about the future of work in the US.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:29</time> 99% perspiration, and American meritocracy  \n<time>08:58</time> Is anyone self-made?  \n<time>21:45</time> How people get rich  \n<time>27:11</time> Neoliberalism, and the rise of hustle culture  \n<time>37:39</time> Countries with other work cultures  \n<time>41:33</time> Should we tell people that hard work pays off?  \n<time>45:35</time> The future of work in the US  \n<time>47:38</time> Follow Adam\u2019s work!\n\n---\n\nFollow Adam\u2019s work:  \nWebsite: https://www.adamchandler.com/  \n99% Perspiration: https://tinyurl.com/yck69a9z\n",
