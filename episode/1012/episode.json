	"shownotes": "Dr. Lance Grande is a Distinguished Service Curator Emeritus at the Field Museum. Dr. Grande's research covers many aspects of fossil and living fishes, including the early development of North American freshwater fish fauna. Over the last 30 years, he has led numerous field trips to collect fossils from Fossil Lake, a 52-million-year-old lake bed in Wyoming. Studying these fossils, together with other well-preserved fossils and living species, allows Dr. Grande to investigate broad-scale questions about the history of the earth and its inhabitants and how they evolved together. He is the author of The Evolution of Religions: A History of Related Traditions.\n\nIn this episode, we focus on The Evolution of Religions. We start by talking about what we can learn about religion through an evolutionary perspective, what (organized) religion is, and whether humans are predisposed to religiosity. We explore how societies moved from supernaturalism to organized religion, and from polytheism to monotheism. We talk about the major branches of Indigenous Eastern and Indigenous Western organized religion, and we go through the major religions, including Hinduism, Buddhism, Taoism, and Confucianism; and then we look at the West, and talk about Greco-Roman polytheism, Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. Finally, we discuss current trends in religiosity and the future of humanity.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:26</time> An evolutionary and agnostic approach to religion  \n<time>02:46</time> What is religion?  \n<time>04:27</time> Organized religion  \n<time>09:01</time> Are humans predisposed to religiosity?  \n<time>15:50</time> Biology and culture  \n<time>23:14</time> From supernaturalism to organized religion  \n<time>31:11</time> Indigenous Eastern and Indigenous Western organized religion  \n<time>38:42</time> Asian Cyclicism, Hinduism, Buddhism, Taoism, and Confucianism  \n<time>46:02</time> Greco-Roman polytheism, monotheism, Judaism, Christianity, and Islam  \n<time>1:05:58</time> Four historical trends in the evolution of religion  \n<time>1:13:57</time> Current trends and the future of humanity  \n<time>1:18:27</time> Follow Dr. Grande\u2019s work!\n\n---\n\nFollow Dr. Grande\u2019s work:  \nFaculty page: https://tinyurl.com/nh35b8fu  \nResearchGate profile: https://tinyurl.com/y27kyu95  \nThe Evolution of Religions: https://tinyurl.com/2cw2wapw\n",
