	"shownotes": "RECORDED ON APRIL 1st 2025.  \nDr. Stefanos Geroulanos is the Director of the Remarque Institute and a Professor of European Intellectual History at New York University. He usually writes about concepts that weave together modern understandings of time, the human, and the body. He is the author or co-author of several books, with the latest one being The Invention of Prehistory: Empire, Violence, and Our Obsession with Human Origins.\n\nIn this episode, we focus on The Invention of Prehistory. We start by talking about how people got interested in prehistory, what \u201cinvention\u201d means in this case, what our understanding of the past is shaped by, and the example of the Neanderthals. We discuss European colonization, and concepts like \u201csavage\u201d and \u201ccivilization\u201d; indigenous peoples and the first humans; \u201chuman nature\u201d and political debates between socialists and capitalists; and eugenics and Nazism. We talk about the impact of popular books, like Yuval Harari\u2019s Sapiens, and claims about how we should live our present lives. Finally, we discuss whether there is any problem with anthropologists studying our past.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:30</time> The invention of prehistory  \n<time>06:11</time> What is our understanding of the past shaped by  \n<time>08:58</time> The example of the Neanderthals  \n<time>12:27</time> European colonization, and concepts like \u201csavage\u201d and \u201ccivilization\u201d  \n<time>18:26</time> Indigenous peoples and the first humans  \n<time>23:58</time> \u201cHuman nature\u201d and political debates between socialists and capitalists  \n<time>30:43</time> Eugenics and Nazism  \n<time>37:32</time> The impact of popular books, like Yuval Harari\u2019s Sapiens  \n<time>41:20</time> Claims about how we should live our present lives  \n<time>45:30</time> Is there any problem with anthropologists studying our past?  \n<time>49:37</time> Follow Dr. Geroulanos\u2019 work!\n\n---\n\nFollow Dr. Geroulanos\u2019 work:  \nFaculty page: https://bit.ly/49jGANZ  \nWebsite: https://bit.ly/49mrOX0  \nThe Invention of Prehistory: https://bit.ly/49hP6NH\n",
