	"published": "2025-08-08",
	"shownotes": "RECORDED ON MAY 29th 2025.  \nNorbert Peeters is a teacher at Wageningen University and a PhD student at the Institute for Philosophy at Leiden University. His research is focused on an investigation of the philosophical and historical roots, implicit founding presuppositions and argumentative structure of the concept of wilderness, and its practical application in Dutch wildlife conservation projects. The first part of his dissertation will focus on the historical roots and the philosophical conceptual structure of our current wilderness concept. The second part will take a more practical approach. By studying several wilderness areas, as denoted by Natura 2000, this dissertation will investigate to what degree the idea of wilderness poses practical problems and solutions to wildlife management.\n\nIn this episode, we talk about botanic philosophy. We first discuss what it is, what a plant is, the concept of plant blindness, and a bit of the history of studying plants. We talk about the work of Alexander von Humboldt and Charles Darwin. We discuss what influenced the way we view the natural world. We explore concepts like wilderness, rewilding, being native, being exotic, and being an invasive species. We discuss plant intelligence, and whether plants have personalities. Finally, we talk about why plants matter.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:50</time> Botanic philosophy  \n<time>04:11</time> What is a plant?  \n<time>06:56</time> Plant blindness  \n<time>16:08</time> The history of studying plants  \n<time>23:37</time> Alexander von Humboldt  \n<time>31:08</time> Charles Darwin as a botanist  \n<time>35:46</time> What influenced how we view the natural world  \n<time>47:25</time> Wilderness and rewilding  \n<time>59:54</time> Being native, being exotic, and invasive species  \n<time>1:12:19</time> Plant intelligence  \n<time>1:20:26</time> Do plants have personalities?  \n<time>1:27:29</time> Why do plants matter?  \n<time>1:34:02</time> Follow Norbert\u2019s work!\n\n---\n\nFollow Norbert\u2019s work:  \nUniversity page: https://tinyurl.com/nr7p79dc\n",
