	"shownotes": "RECORDED ON DECEMBER 8th 2023.  \nDr. Vinod Goel is Professor in the Department of Psychology at York University. He is interested in understanding the cognitive, computational, and neural basis of rational decision-making and emotional processing in humans. He is the author of Reason and Less: Pursuing Food, Sex, and Politics.\n\nIn this episode, we focus on Reason and Less. We start by discussing how to understand rationality from an evolutionary and neuroscientific perspective, how rationality relates to the emotions, and the concept of tethered rationality. We talk more broadly about the tethered mind, and the autonomic, instinctive, and associative systems. We discuss how the tethered mind develops. We talk about the role of feelings. We discuss coherence, and a control structure for tethered rationality. We talk about why sometimes it is so hard to change people\u2019s beliefs, and the role of group membership. Finally, we discuss the main implications of the tethered mind model.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:26</time> What is rationality?  \n<time>09:35</time> How rationality relates to emotions  \n<time>15:14</time> Tethered rationality  \n<time>19:42</time> The autonomic, instinctive, and associative systems  \n<time>30:52</time> Why the focus on food, sex, and politics?  \n<time>32:36</time> How the tethered mind develops  \n<time>37:19</time> What are feelings?  \n<time>44:58</time> Coherence, and a control structure for tethered rationality  \n<time>53:03</time> Changing people\u2019s beliefs, and the role of groups membership  \n<time>1:03:01</time> The main implications of the tethered mind model  \n<time>1:11:29</time> Follow Dr. Goel\u2019s work!\n\n---\n\nFollow Dr. Goel\u2019s work:  \nFaculty page: https://bit.ly/3PnBBmF  \nResearchGate profile: https://bit.ly/3PaMr0z  \nReason and Less: https://bit.ly/3rtXMzA\n",
