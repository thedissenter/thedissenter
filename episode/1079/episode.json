	"shownotes": "RECORDED ON FEBRUARY 3rd 2025.  \nDr. Christopher Federico is Professor of Political Science and Psychology at the University of Minnesota. He also serves as President of the International Society of Political Psychology. His research focuses in particular on the nature of ideology and belief systems, the psychological foundations of political preferences, and intergroup attitudes. He is co-author (with Christopher Johnston and Howard Lavine) of Open Versus Closed: Personality, Identity, and the Politics of Redistribution, and a co-editor of the volumes At the Forefront of Political Psychology: Essays in Honor of John L. Sullivan, and The Political Psychology of Democratic Citizenship.\n\nIn this episode, we start by talking about the foundations of political preferences, and liberal and conservative attitudes. We discuss an elite-driven view of ideological belief systems. We talk about the phenomenon of collective narcissism, and how it relates to in-group satisfaction, nationalism, and perceptions that the 2020 election in the US was illegitimate. We also talk about collective self-esteem, ideological uncertainty, and the link between religiosity and political ideology. Finally, we discuss the phenomenon of feelings of group-extinction threat, and how (white) people react to their perceived numerical decline.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:31</time> The foundations of political preferences  \n<time>03:19</time> Liberal and conservative attitudes  \n<time>09:41</time> An elite-driven view of ideological belief systems  \n<time>16:10</time> Collective narcissism and in-group satisfaction  \n<time>23:37</time> Collective narcissism and nationalism  \n<time>25:30</time> Collective narcissism and the 2020 election in the US  \n<time>28:22</time> Collective self-esteem  \n<time>31:44</time> Ideological uncertainty  \n<time>36:09</time> The link between religiosity and political ideology  \n<time>40:59</time> How do (white) people react to their perceived numerical decline?  \n<time>55:26</time> Follow Dr. Federico\u2019s work!\n\n---\n\nFollow Dr. Federico\u2019s work:  \nFaculty page: https://tinyurl.com/47brzjwm  \nResearchGate profile: https://tinyurl.com/5ah33523\n",
