She is a MacArthur Fellow and has received the National Humanities Medal of the US, the National Jewish Book Award, and numerous other honors. She\u2019s the author of ten books, both fiction and nonfiction, including The Mind-Body Problem, Betraying Spinoza, and Plato at the Googleplex. Her latest book is The Mattering Instinct: How Our Deepest Longing Drives Us and Divides Us.\n\nIn this episode, we focus on The Mattering Instinct. We start by discussing what it is to matter, the mattering instinct, the social aspects of mattering, and four mattering types: socializers, transcenders, competitors, and heroic strivers. We talk about cosmic and biological mattering. We discuss whether mattering can be universalized, and an objective standard to distinguish between better and worse ways to respond to the mattering instinct. Finally, we talk about nihilism and absurdism, and whether the unexamined life is worth living.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:57</time> What is it to matter?  \n<time>02:46</time> The mattering instinct  \n<time>09:28</time> The social aspects of mattering  \n<time>14:39</time> Four mattering types: socializers, transcenders, competitors, and heroic strivers  \n<time>27:44</time> Cosmic and biological mattering  \n<time>44:03</time> Can mattering be universalized?  \n<time>53:07</time> An objective standard to distinguish between better and worse ways to respond to the mattering instinct  \n<time>1:01:09</time> Nihilism and absurdism  \n<time>1:10:04</time> Is the unexamined life not worth living?  \n<time>1:14:51</time> Follow Dr. Goldstein\u2019s work!\n\n---\n\nFollow Dr. Goldstein\u2019s work:  \nWebsite: https://www.rebeccagoldstein.com/  \nThe Mattering Instinct: https://tinyurl.com/ywhdusma  \nBooks: https://tinyurl.com/y7gxkgyf  \nTwitter handle: @platobooktour\n",
