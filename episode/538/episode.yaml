  \ of Philosophy. We first discuss what Dr. Gaukroger means by failures in Philosophy\
  \ in his book. We ask what philosophy is, and what we can learn about it by studying\
  \ how it failed. We get into some of the history of philosophy, from Plato to the\
  \ natural philosophers. Finally, we discuss the current status of philosophy, how\
  \ it relates to science, and its possible future.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time>\
