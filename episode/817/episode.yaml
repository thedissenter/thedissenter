shownotes: "RECORDED ON JUNE 8th 2023.  \nDr. Raymond Hames is Professor of Anthropology\
  \ at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. His research interests are in behavioral\
  \ ecology, food and labor exchange, human ecology, marriage, and kin and parental\
  \ investment. He is a member of the National Academy of Sciences (anthropology section),\
  \ past-president of the Evolutionary Anthropology Society of the American Anthropological\
  \ Association, consulting editor for Human Nature, and for ten years he served as\
  \ treasurer of the Human Behavior and Evolution Society. \n\nIn this episode, we\
  \ talk about topics in evolutionary anthropology and human behavioral ecology. We\
  \ first talk about male hunting, and what we can learn about human sociality by\
  \ studying it. We discuss if hunting peoples are conservationists. We talk about\
  \ the costs and benefits of monogamy and polygyny for women, and what explains polyandry.\
  \ We discuss human warfare, the debate between the \u201Cdeep-rooters\u201D and\
  \ the \u201Cshallow-rooters\u201D, and Chagnon\u2019s argument that Unokai have\
  \ more wives and children than others. We talk about male androphilia, its universality,\
  \ and what explains it. We discuss the divide between the evolutionary and sociocultural\
  \ subfields within anthropology, and address criticisms of evolutionary anthropology.\
  \ Finally, we talk about the relationship between human behavioral ecology and evolutionary\
  \ psychology.\n\n\nTime Links:  \n00:00 Intro  \n00:33  Why do males hunt?  \n03:03\
