  \ The Science of Children's Religious Belief.\n\nThis is another episode about the\
  \ cognitive science of religion. First, we discuss the aspects of religion that\
  \ science can tackle and determine as right or wrong. After that, we briefly establish\
  \ what a \u201Cbelief\u201D is. Then, we refer to some of the main cognitive mechanisms\
  \ and aspects of child development associated with religious thinking. We also discuss\
  \ if religion is better understood as a by-product of evolution or an adaptation\
  \ itself. Toward the end, we talk about John Calvin\u2019s sensus divinitatis, and\
  \ also how the New Atheists tend to oversimplify religion.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:54\
