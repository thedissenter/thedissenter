Her latest book is Defending Pornography: Free Speech, Sex, and the Fight for Women's Rights.\n\nIn this episode, we focus on Defending Pornography. We start by defining \u201cpornography\u201d. We then go through the main arguments put forward by anti-porn feminists, and the counterarguments used by the anti-censorship feminists. We discuss whether pornography is harmful to the viewers, how censoring porn can also target sexual education in schools, as well as LGBTQ+ people. We talk about the traits of people who are against pornography. We discuss paternalism in the context of pornography, and how censorship can harm porn performers. We talk about approaches such as legalization and decriminalization, and how we can fight against trafficking. Finally, we discuss how important it is to hear from the performers themselves.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>01:20</time> What is pornography?  \n<time>10:35</time> Arguments for the censoring of pornography  \n<time>15:17</time> Is pornography harmful?  \n<time>23:59</time> Targeting sexual education in schools  \n<time>27:47</time> Targeting LGBTQ+ people  \n<time>30:51</time> Is there \u201csexual exploitation\u201d in porn?  \n<time>37:45</time> People who are against pornography  \n<time>42:32</time> Paternalistic feminism  \n<time>45:25</time> Harming porn performers  \n<time>47:11</time> Legalization, and fighting against trafficking  \n<time>49:10</time> The importance of talking with the performers themselves  \n<time>55:37</time> Follow Dr. Strossen\u2019s work!\n\n---\n\nFollow Dr. Strossen\u2019s work:  \nOur first interview: https://youtu.be/bloanBUhjVo  \nFaculty page: https://bit.ly/47Gr8uC  \nDefending Pornography: https://tinyurl.com/mut5evcr\n",
