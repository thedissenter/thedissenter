  \ of Genetics and Neuroscience at Trinity College Dublin. He is interested in the\
  \ development of connectivity in the brain, specifically in how this process is\
  \ controlled by genes and how mutations in such genes affect the connectivity of\
  \ neuronal circuits, influence behavior and perception and contribute to disease.\
  \ His research group uses genetic approaches in the mouse to address these questions,\
  \ and they are also involved in collaborative research looking at the genetics and\
  \ phenotypic manifestations of synaesthesia and schizophrenia in humans. He\u2019\
  s the author of Innate: How the Wiring of Our Brains Shapes Who We Are.\n\nIn this\
  \ episode, we talk about psychological epigenetics. We first address what is epigenetics,\
  \ and when people first identified epigenetic mechanisms or theorized about them.\
  \ We refer to several mechanisms, involving chromatin, methylation, and others.\
  \ We discuss if epigenetics fits into the larger puzzle of evolutionary theory.\
  \ We talk about the problems and limitations of studies of transgenerational epigenetics\
  \ done in mice and humans, and we refer to the Dutch famine and Irish famine studies.\
  \ We refer to how psychoanalysts deal with epigenetics, and what it would take for\
  \ a behavior to modify the epigenetic profile of an individual and then get transmitted\
  \ to their offspring. We mention other fads in neuroscience, like neuroplasticity\
  \ and mirror neurons. We discuss modularity of mind. Finally, we talk about how\
  \ the science of epigenetics should be communicated to the general public. We end\
  \ with a brief teaser to Dr. Mitchell\u2019s next book.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:00\
