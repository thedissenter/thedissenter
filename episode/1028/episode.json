	"shownotes": "RECORDED ON NOVEMBER 28th 2023.  \nDr. Sergio Alm\u00e9cija is Senior Research Scientist in Biological Anthropology at the American Museum of Natural History. He studies the key adaptations defining different stages of ape and human evolution (i.e., hominoid evolution). He pays special attention to the process leading and following the split between humans and apes (i.e., \u201cnon-human hominoids\u201d). He is the editor of Humans: Perspectives on Our Evolution from World Experts.\n\nIn this episode, we focus on Humans. We start by talking about the story behind the book, and how Dr. Alm\u00e9cija came up with the questions asked to the experts. We discuss what the antecedents of human evolution are, and the relationship between primatology and anthropology. We talk about what it means to be human according to anthropology, and the insights we can get from other disciplines, like medicine, psychology, and philosophy. We discuss what were the questions the experts disagreed the most on, and the biggest known unknowns in human evolution. Finally, we discuss whether a scientific perspective on humans is compatible with religious or spiritual views.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:33</time> How the book came about  \n<time>05:04</time> The questions asked to the experts  \n<time>16:22</time> The antecedents of human evolution  \n<time>19:45</time> The relationship between primatology and anthropology  \n<time>25:57</time> What does it mean to be human?  \n<time>34:48</time> Other disciplines, like medicine, psychology, and philosophy  \n<time>40:50</time> The most disputed questions about humans  \n<time>48:43</time> The biggest known unknowns in human evolution  \n<time>55:38</time> Is a scientific perspective on humans compatible with religious or spiritual views?  \n<time>58:37</time> Follow Dr. Alm\u00e9cija\u2019s work!\n\n---\n\nFollow Dr. Alm\u00e9cija\u2019s work:  \nAMNH page: https://bit.ly/48TpiHZ  \nWebsite: https://bit.ly/46UNM1J  \nResearchGate profile: https://bit.ly/3F0BGbn  \nHumans: https://bit.ly/3tihDmb\n",
