shownotes: "Dr. Deborah Carr is a Professor of Sociology and inaugural director of\
  \ the Center of Innovation in Social Science at Boston University. Her research\
  \ interests include aging and the life course, psychosocial factors influences on\
  \ health over the life course, and end-of-life issues. Her latest book is Aging\
  \ in America.\n\nIn this episode, we focus on aging, but also tackle other social\
  \ issues in the US. We first discuss the obesity \u201Cepidemic\u201D, the causes\
  \ of obesity, and weight stigma. We talk about the relationship between the kinds\
  \ of physical activity people engage in and perceived health. We discuss the life\
  \ trajectories and long-term planning of married and single people. We talk about\
  \ challenges in time management for married couples with children, changes in gender\
  \ roles, and work-life balance. We discuss challenges disabled people face (during\
  \ the pandemic, at work, and in old age), and how hard it is being poor/leaving\
  \ poverty. We talk about racial and ethnic differences in healthcare planning, how\
  \ perceptions of survival affect it, and end-of-life decisions. Finally, we discuss\
  \ how widowhood affects people, and the social effects of inequality.\n\nTime Links:\
