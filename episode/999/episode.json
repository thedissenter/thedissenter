	"title": "#999 Tobias Gerstenberg: How We Think About Causality and Moral Responsibility",
	"published": "2024-09-27",
	"shownotes": "RECORDED ON JANUARY 18th 2024.  \nDr. Tobias Gerstenberg is an Assistant Professor of Psychology at Stanford University, where he leads the Causality in Cognition Lab (CICL). Dr. Gerstenberg's research is highly interdisciplinary. It combines ideas from philosophy, linguistics, computer science, and the legal sciences to better understand higher-level cognitive phenomena such as causal inference and moral judgment.\n\nIn this episode, we talk about causal cognition. We first discuss what it is, and what it means to attribute causality. We talk about counterfactual thinking, intuitive ideas about causality, causation by omission, and how people single out \u201cthe\u201d cause. We also talk about causal learning in continuous-time settings, and then get into how causal cognition connects to attributions of moral responsibility, and how people deal with knowledgeable versus ignorant agents, and the role that intentions play. Finally, we discuss the relationship between intuitive physics and intuitive psychology, and moral judgment.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:41</time> What is causal cognition?  \n<time>03:56</time> What does it mean to attribute causality?  \n<time>07:14</time> Counterfactual thinking  \n<time>20:27</time> Intuitive ideas about causality  \n<time>25:10</time> Causation by omission  \n<time>38:35</time> How do people single out \u201cthe\u201d cause?  \n<time>50:09</time> Causal learning in a continuous-time setting  \n<time>55:19</time> How causal cognition connects to attributions of responsibility  \n<time>59:11</time> Knowledgeable versus ignorant agents  \n<time>1:05:26</time> The role of intentions  \n<time>1:14:59</time> The relationship between intuitive physics and intuitive psychology, and moral judgment  \n<time>1:19:23</time> Follow Dr. Gerstenberg\u2019s work!\n\n---\n\nFollow Dr. Gerstenberg\u2019s work:  \nFaculty page: https://bit.ly/40nJAVQ  \nGoogle Scholar page: https://bit.ly/3FKAWY5  \nTwitter handle: @tobigerstenberg\n",
