excerpt: "Dr. Kevin Dorst is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Linguistics\
  \ and Philosophy at MIT. He works on epistemology, logic, language, and their intersections.\
  \  In epistemology he\u2019s interested in what we should think (the belief-credence\
  \ connection), why we should think it (foundations), and how we should think about\
  \ what we should think (higher-order uncertainty).  In logic, he\u2019s interested\
  \ in various models of these things; in language, he\u2019s interested the semantics\
  \ of various statements about them. More recently, he\u2019s been thinking about\
  \ the connection between epistemology and cognitive science and psychology\u2014\
  and, in particular, how our idealized models and theories of rationality can help\
  \ inform our understanding of our non-ideal selves."

  \ in the Department of Linguistics and Philosophy at MIT. He works on epistemology,\
  \ logic, language, and their intersections.  In epistemology he\u2019s interested\
  \ in what we should think (the belief-credence connection), why we should think\
  \ it (foundations), and how we should think about what we should think (higher-order\
  \ uncertainty).  In logic, he\u2019s interested in various models of these things;\
  \ in language, he\u2019s interested the semantics of various statements about them.\
  \ More recently, he\u2019s been thinking about the connection between epistemology\
  \ and cognitive science and psychology\u2014and, in particular, how our idealized\
  \ models and theories of rationality can help inform our understanding of our non-ideal\
  \ selves.\n\nIn this episode, we talk about epistemology. We go through topics like:\
  \ the questions epistemology deals with; what a belief is; the distinction between\
  \ beliefs, assertions, and guesses; justified beliefs; higher-order evidence, and\
  \ higher-order uncertainty; epistemic modesty; and when to defer to experts.\n\n\
