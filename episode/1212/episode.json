	"shownotes": "RECORDED ON NOVEMBER 12th 2025.  \nDr. Marina Dubova is an Omidyar postdoctoral fellow at the Santa Fe Institute. Her research aims to reveal and inform the cognitive mechanisms of discovery. She develops formal (e.g., computational models) and empirical methods (e.g., cognitive experiments with scientists) to put the foundations of scientific method to rigorous tests. She uses insights from cognitive science to learn how theories and data can be integrated and lead to better understandings of the world.\n\nIn this episode, we first talk about the cognitive mechanisms of discovery. We discuss the cognitive foundations of the scientific method. We talk about experimentation, and how it can be randomized. We discuss concept-laden evidence, and the importance of cultural and cognitive diversity in science. Finally, we talk about parsimony and complexity.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:28</time> The cognitive mechanisms of discovery  \n<time>04:14</time> The cognitive foundations of the scientific method  \n<time>10:09</time> Experimentation  \n<time>19:37</time> Randomizing experimentation  \n<time>22:35</time> Concept-laden evidence  \n<time>32:15</time> Parsimony and complexity  \n<time>40:50</time> Follow Dr. Dubova\u2019s work!\n\n---\n\nFollow Dr. Dubova\u2019s work:  \nUniversity page: https://tinyurl.com/2w6532xs  \nWebsite: https://www.mdubova.com/  \nTwitter handle: @dubova_marina\n",
