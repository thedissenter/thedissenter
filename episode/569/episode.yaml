excerpt: Dr. Andrew Thomas is a Lecturer in Psychology at Swansea University, UK.
  His research is concerned with the differences in mating strategies within and between
  the sexes. This includes environmental and social factors which contribute to this
  variance and whether mating preferences themselves are reactive to environmental
  changes over short-term periods. He also has a secondary interest in cyber-psychology
  and online interaction; particularly how one represents oneself using internet avatars
  and aliases.

  \ Psychology at Swansea University, UK. His research is concerned with the differences\
  \ in mating strategies within and between the sexes. This includes environmental\
  \ and social factors which contribute to this variance and whether mating preferences\
  \ themselves are reactive to environmental changes over short-term periods. He also\
  \ has a secondary interest in cyber-psychology and online interaction; particularly\
  \ how one represents oneself using internet avatars and aliases.\n\nIn this episode,\
  \ we talk about mating, mate preferences, and cyberpsychology. We start with the\
  \ ovulatory-shift hypothesis, and ask if women seek out extra-pair copulations at\
  \ peak fertility. We then get into mating, and discuss the mate preference priority\
  \ model, and what are people\u2019s priorities when it comes to mate preferences,\
  \ and how they vary cross-culturally. We talk about how testosterone might be related\
  \ to mating strategy changes in men. We talk about sociosexuality, sexual compulsivity,\
  \ and fetishes related to them, like voyeurism and exhibitionism. We discuss a Psychology\
  \ Today post by Dr. Thomas - Will Men Really Sleep With Just About Anyone? We talk\
  \ about the distinction between sex and gender. We discuss the MCFC (Males Compete\
  \ Females Chose) model, and the MMC (Mutual Mate Choice) model of sexual selection.\
