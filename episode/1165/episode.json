	"shownotes": "RECORDED ON JULY 18th 2025.  \nDr. Aubrey de Grey is a biomedical gerontologist. He is the author of The Mitochondrial Free Radical Theory of Aging (1999) and co-author of Ending Aging (2007). Dr. de Grey is known for his view that medical technology may enable human beings alive today not to die from age-related causes. As an amateur mathematician, he has contributed to the study of the Hadwiger\u2013Nelson problem in geometric graph theory, making the first progress on the problem in over 60 years.\n\nIn this episode, we talk about the science of aging and longevity. We first talk about what got Dr. de Grey interested in aging, and what aging is and its causes. We talk about the concept of longevity escape velocity, the 7 deadly things, how to combat aging, and biomedical approaches to aging, including metformin and rapamycin. We discuss how close biomedical technology is to significantly postponing aging, and how we could end menopause. Finally, we talk about issues pertaining to overpopulation and retirement, and the anti-aging industry.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:22</time> The science of aging  \n<time>01:41</time> What is aging and what causes it?  \n<time>06:37</time> Longevity escape velocity  \n<time>09:06</time> The 7 deadly things  \n<time>15:01</time> How to combat aging  \n<time>17:47</time> Biomedical approaches to aging, metformin, and rapamycin  \n<time>25:08</time> How close is biomedical technology to significantly postponing aging?  \n<time>29:36</time> Ending menopause  \n<time>32:48</time> Overpopulation and retirement  \n<time>39:01</time> The anti-aging industry  \n<time>41:14</time> Follow Dr. de Grey\u2019s work!\n\n---\n\nFollow Dr. de Grey\u2019s work:  \nBooks on Amazon: https://tinyurl.com/3e542yv5  \nX handle: @aubreydegrey\n",
