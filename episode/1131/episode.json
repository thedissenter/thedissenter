	"shownotes": "RECORDED ON MAY 27th 2025.  \nDr. Alan Love is Distinguished McKnight University Professor of Philosophy and Winton Chair in the Liberal Arts at the University of Minnesota, as well as Director of the Minnesota Center for Philosophy of Science. His research focuses on conceptual issues in biology and has concentrated on evolutionary developmental biology (Evo-devo), developmental biology, molecular biology, and paleontology (among others). Other areas of interest include the role of history in philosophical research and the nature of intuitions generated by thought experiments in philosophical inquiry.\n\nIn this episode, we first talk about developmental biology, and how development links to evolution. We discuss evo-devo approaches in biology, whether we need an extended evolutionary synthesis, and whether organisms can direct their own evolution. We then talk about evolvability, evolutionary novelties and how they are generated, and how stress mechanisms and physical dynamics contribute to evolutionary novelties. Finally, we discuss the future of developmental biology.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:40</time> Developmental biology, and how development links to evolution  \n<time>18:20</time> Evo-devo approaches in biology  \n<time>26:08</time> The extended evolutionary synthesis  \n<time>28:41</time> Can organisms direct their own evolution?  \n<time>30:38</time> Evolvability  \n<time>37:07</time> Evolutionary novelties, and how they are generated  \n<time>44:04</time> Stress mechanisms and physical dynamics, and how they contribute to evolutionary novelties  \n<time>50:17</time> The future of developmental biology  \n<time>54:12</time> Follow Dr. Love\u2019s work!\n\n---\n\nFollow Dr. Love\u2019s work:  \nFaculty page: https://tinyurl.com/bdehcm4t  \nWebsite: https://tinyurl.com/ycpbx83p  \nPhilPeople profile: https://tinyurl.com/r7kbkfsx\n",
