	"shownotes": "RECORDED ON AUGUST 27th 2024.  \nDr. Elise Zipkin is Red Cedar Distinguished Professor and Director of the Ecology, Evolution, and Behavior Program in the Department of Integrative Biology at Michigan State University. She is a quantitative ecologist who connects the complexities of natural communities with the precision of mathematics to shine light on mysteries in ecology and conservation. Dr. Zipkin and her team develop analytical frameworks to address grand challenges in the study of biodiversity loss and the effects of anthropogenic activities, such as climate change.\n\nIn this episode, we start by talking about animal population dynamics and how we can study species distribution. We then delve into biodiversity: what it is; why we should care about it; and the interplay between human activity and biodiversity. We then discuss conservation: what it is; how we decide which species to conserve; and invasive species and how we deal with them. Finally, we talk about the effects of climate change, and whether it is possible to predict how different species will react to climate change.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:39</time> Animal population dynamics  \n<time>03:09</time> Species distribution  \n<time>06:23</time> What is biodiversity, and why should we care about it?  \n<time>12:55</time> Human activities and biodiversity  \n<time>17:22</time> Conservation  \n<time>20:18</time> How we decide which species to conserve  \n<time>23:36</time> Invasive species, and how we deal with them  \n<time>32:54</time> The effects of climate change  \n<time>38:31</time> Predicting how species react to climate change  \n<time>42:16</time> Follow Dr. Zipkin\u2019s work!\n\n---\n\nFollow Dr. Zipkin\u2019s work:  \nFaculty page: https://shorturl.at/qjDjP  \nZipkin Quantitative Ecology Lab: https://shorturl.at/WxNjc  \nResearchGate profile: https://shorturl.at/FS4fc  \nTwitter handle: @ZipkinLab\n",
