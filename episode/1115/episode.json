We then discuss the impact of the 2008 economic crisis, the formation of a Portuguese national identity, the welfare state, the political system (including the electoral system, party representation, and recent party dynamics), and the Portuguese economy in the 21st century. We also talk about social attitudes toward women, immigrants and minorities; the state of science and academia; the production and consumption of art; and the \u201cEuropeanization\u201d of Portugal.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:40</time> The goals of the book  \n<time>04:14</time> The transition from dictatorship to democracy  \n<time>19:13</time> Portugal in the European Union  \n<time>27:54</time> The 2008 economic crisis  \n<time>30:37</time> The formation of a Portuguese national identity  \n<time>33:30</time> The welfare state  \n<time>38:29</time> The electoral system, party representation, and party dynamics  \n<time>44:08</time> The Portuguese economy in the 21st century  \n<time>48:44</time> Social attitudes toward women, immigrants and minorities  \n<time>53:43</time> Science and academia  \n<time>59:07</time> Production and consumption of art  \n<time>1:05:14</time> The \u201cEuropeanization\u201d of Portugal  \n<time>1:09:50</time> Follow Dr. Silva\u2019s work!\n\n---\n\nFollow Dr. Silva\u2019s work:  \nFaculty page: https://tinyurl.com/2py29us5  \nPortugal in the 21st Century: https://tinyurl.com/36hp5448\n",
