You can watch the first one here: https://youtu.be/cNYQVJoF7JM  \nAnd the second one here: https://youtu.be/MIm3gOZvA0k\n\nIn this episode, we talk about academic freedom. We start by discussing the role of universities, and if political activism is incompatible with academia. We discuss if someone should be punished academically for expressing non-normative views. We talk about current threats to academic freedom from the political left and the right. We discuss if all speech and ideas should be allowed on campus and in academic work. We talk about respecting the sensibilities of students, and the idea of trigger warnings. We discuss the role of moral philosophers within academia. We talk about the Journal of Controversial Ideas, the motivations behind it, and its goals. We discuss publication criteria and academic standards. We talk about the concept of “cancel culture”, and the controversial idea of questioning free speech. Finally, we discuss if the motivations of academics matter.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:44</time> The role of universities  \n<time>03:51</time> Is political activism incompatible with academia?  \n<time>08:13</time> Should someone be punished academically for expressing non-normative views?  \n<time>12:28</time> Threats to academic freedom from the left and the right  \n<time>21:28</time> Should all speech and ideas be allowed on campus and in academic work?  \n<time>23:51</time> The sensibilities of students, and trigger warnings  \n<time>29:12</time> Should academics care about the norms of their culture?  \n<time>30:57</time> The role of moral philosophers  \n<time>35:04</time> The Journal of Controversial Ideas  \n<time>40:09</time> What is a controversial idea?  \n<time>45:16</time> Publication criteria and academic standards  \n<time>55:34</time> On the term “cancel culture”  \n<time>57:33</time> Questioning free speech as a controversial idea  \n<time>1:08:59</time> Do the motivations of academics matter?  \n<time>1:17:38</time> Follow Dr. McMahan’s work!\n\n---\n\nFollow Dr. McMahan’s work:  \nFaculty Page: http://bit.ly/367MzFG  \nPhilPeople page: http://bit.ly/2GjzJbE  \nPersonal website: http://bit.ly/36atClp  \nAmazon page: https://amzn.to/2MNC1Ud\n",
