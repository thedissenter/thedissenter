  \ our conversation centers on some of the main topics of Dr. Stewart-Williams\u2019\
  \ most recent book, The Ape That Understood the Universe. We first go through some\
  \ of the basics of modern evolutionary theory and evolutionary biology, like units\
  \ and levels of selection, and sexual selection, and also establish the relationship\
  \ between biology and culture at the same time. Then, we discuss the origins of\
  \ sex differences, and psychological traits as part of our phenotype. We also refer\
  \ to the problem with using the term \u201Cgender\u201D in science. We then talk\
  \ about the model MMC (Mutual Mate Choice) in human sexual selection, and if there\
  \ is any preferred mating system in human societies, like monogamy or polygamy.\
  \ Toward the end, we talk about the evolutionary mismatch between our ancestral\
  \ environments and our modern industrialized scientific societies, and how to approach\
  \ the study of religion from a biological/evolutionary standpoint.\n\nTime Links:\
