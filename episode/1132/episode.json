	"shownotes": "RECORDED ON JUNE 6th 2025.  \nDr. Kevin Mitchell is Associate Professor of Genetics and Neuroscience at Trinity College Dublin. He is interested in the development of connectivity in the brain, specifically in how this process is controlled by genes and how mutations in such genes affect the connectivity of neuronal circuits, influence behavior and perception and contribute to disease. His latest book is Free Agents: How Evolution Gave Us Free Will.\n\nIn this episode, we start by talking about free will. We discuss free will at the molecular level and the different levels of analysis. We discuss top-down causation and process philosophy. We talk about decision-making, why certain possibilities spring to mind and not others, and why it can pay off to behave randomly sometimes. We also discuss whether AI could have free will. We then talk about Dr. Mitchell\u2019s debates with Dr. Robert Sapolsky, and how we should reframe the free will debate within science. We discuss the genomic code, and how the genome instantiates a generative model of the organism. Finally, we talk about the science and ethics of human embryo editing, and the trouble with eugenics.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:53</time> Free will at the molecular level  \n<time>12:47</time> Top-down causation, and process philosophy  \n<time>21:00</time> Decision-making, and why certain possibilities spring to mind and not others  \n<time>31:48</time> Why it pays off to behave randomly sometimes  \n<time>34:34</time> Could AI have free will?  \n<time>40:41</time> The free will debates with Robert Sapolsky  \n<time>1:02:57</time> Reframing the free will debate within science  \n<time>1:06:03</time> How the genome instantiates a generative model of the organism  \n<time>1:36:42</time> The science and ethics of human embryo editing  \n<time>1:45:29</time> The trouble with eugenics  \n<time>2:05:18</time> Follow Dr. Mitchell\u2019s work!\n\n---\n\nFollow Dr. Mitchell\u2019s work:  \nOur first interview: https://youtu.be/VBc9Ava4Dgg  \nOur second interview: https://youtu.be/6Ugbm6HJko4  \nOur third interview: https://youtu.be/Euv_pwsAkkQ  \nFaculty page: http://bit.ly/32qe0rS  \nPersonal website: http://bit.ly/33Bpuc7  \nFree Agents: https://bit.ly/3GX0TEZ  \nWiring the Brain (blog): http://bit.ly/2MKhzCA  \nResearchGate profile: http://bit.ly/2LVNCBJ  \nX handle: @WiringTheBrain\n",
