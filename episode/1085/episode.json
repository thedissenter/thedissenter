	"shownotes": "RECORDED ON FEBRUARY 20th 2025.  \nDr. Joshua Glasgow is Professor in (and Chair of) the Philosophy Department at Sonoma State University. Dr. Glasgow works on a variety of topics in moral, political, and legal philosophy.  His publications have covered a variety of issues concerning ethics, the good life, race and racism, language, law, mind, and more. His latest book is The Significance Impulse: On the Unimportance of Our Cosmic Unimportance.\n\nIn this episode, we focus on The Significance Impulse. We discuss what the \u201csignificance impulse\u201d is, and what it means for something to be important or ordinary. We talk about nihilism, pessimism, and absurdism. We discuss how most achievements are collective and not individual, fame and wealth, and whether it is possible to be remembered forever. We talk about whether the lives of important people are better than ordinary lives. Finally, we discuss things that are \u201cworthwhile in themselves\u201d, what makes life meaningful, how our unimportance relieves us of anxiety, and how to avoid mediocrity.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:43</time> The significance impulse  \n<time>01:16</time> Important, and ordinary  \n<time>05:38</time> Nihilism  \n<time>09:22</time> Pessimism  \n<time>15:11</time> Absurdism  \n<time>19:48</time> Achievements  \n<time>22:46</time> Fame and wealth  \n<time>27:22</time> Is it possible to be remembered forever?  \n<time>29:16</time> Are important lives better than ordinary lives?  \n<time>35:37</time> Things that are \u201cworthwhile in themselves\u201d  \n<time>39:47</time> What makes life meaningful?  \n<time>43:18</time> How our unimportance relieves us of anxiety  \n<time>46:37</time> Mediocrity  \n<time>48:25</time> Follow Dr. Glasgow\u2019s work!\n\n---\n\nFollow Dr. Glasgow\u2019s work:  \nFaculty page: https://bit.ly/2L6ayz1  \nWebsite: https://bit.ly/382ZiMJ  \nPhilPeople profile: http://bit.ly/3bTWqUj  \nAmazon page: http://amzn.to/38RHKDo  \nThe Significance Impulse: https://tinyurl.com/3vyay26n\n",
