	"shownotes": "RECORDED ON APRIL 9th 2025.  \nDr. Manvir Singh is Assistant Professor of Anthropology at the University of California, Davis. His research program aims to explain why societies develop complex, recurrent traditions such as shamanism, witchcraft, origin myths, property rights, sharing norms, lullabies, dance, music, and gods, as these have appeared in all types of societies across the globe, from nomadic hunter-gatherer bands to complex, industrial, mega-urbanized states. He is the author of Shamanism: The Timeless Religion.\n\nIn this episode, we focus on Shamanism. We start by discussing what shamanism is, the work of Dr. Singh in Siberut, and the psychological foundations of shamanism. We then talk about shamanism in industrialized societies, how shamanism relates to organized religion, neo-shamanism, practices and rituals in shamanism, trance and shamanic states of consciousness, and initiations. We also talk about the social roles of shamans, and we discuss whether shamanism works. Finally, we talk about the use of psychedelics in traditional societies.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:37</time> What is shamanism?  \n<time>06:54</time> Shamanism in Siberut  \n<time>12:34</time> The psychological foundations of shamanism  \n<time>17:17</time> Shamanism in industrialized societies  \n<time>21:55</time> Shamanism and organized religion  \n<time>29:14</time> Neo-shamanism  \n<time>32:49</time> Practices and rituals in shamanism  \n<time>34:29</time> Trance  \n<time>40:22</time> Initiations  \n<time>42:23</time> The social roles of shamans  \n<time>43:22</time> Does shamanism work?  \n<time>51:44</time> The use of psychedelics in traditional societies  \n<time>1:00:21</time> Follow Dr. Singh\u2019s work!\n\n---\n\nFollow Dr. Singh\u2019s work:  \nOur first interview: https://youtu.be/Ijf8cNBgztA  \nOur second interview: https://youtu.be/5D9CtvAiwa8  \nWebsite: https://www.manvir.org/  \nResearchGate profile: https://bit.ly/2WeXaKF  \nShamanism: https://tinyurl.com/4rrj4ta4  \nX handle: @mnvrsngh\n",
