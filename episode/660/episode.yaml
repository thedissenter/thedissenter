  \ and their self-perceptions of their own mate value. We discuss possible psychotherapeutic\
  \ approaches, and singlehood. We talk about how people should view incels, misrepresentations\
  \ in the media, and the advice they get online. We then get into some issues with\
  \ modern mating, how it is hard for both men and women, and potential solutions.\n\
