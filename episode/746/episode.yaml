shownotes: "Dr. Simon Baron-Cohen is Professor of Developmental Psychopathology at\

  \ Centre. He has made major contributions to the fields of typical cognitive sex\

  \ The Pattern Seekers: A New Theory of Human Invention.\n\nIn this episode, we talk\
  \ about autism and sex differences. We first talk about autism; what characterizes\
  \ it; why it is classified as a mental disorder, and the idea of neurodiversity;\
  \ its early signs; and the lower quality of life of autistic people. We discuss\
  \ the systemizing mechanism, and the distinction between systemizing and empathizing.\
  \ We talk about the role of testosterone in intra-uterine development, and differences\
  \ in the brain development of autistic people.  We discuss why the distinction between\
  \ cognitive and emotional empathy is important. Finally, we talk about sex differences,\
  \ regions of the brain that might be sexually dimorphic, criticisms of the biological\
  \ bases of sex differences, and we discuss if it is possible to distinguish between\
  \ male and female brains.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:00 Intro  \n00:49  What characterizes\
