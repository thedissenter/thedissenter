We start by talking about Olivia\u2019s background and how she got into sex work, and the types of clients she has. We discuss the pros and cons of sex work, and the traits that make people successful in sex work. We talk about common assumptions people make about sex work, including it being exploitative, the traits of people who are against sex work, whether porn stars are \u201cdamaged goods\u201d, transactional sex, relationships with clients, and whether we live in a promiscuous culture. We discuss the attitudes feminists have toward sex work, whether sex work can be empowering, and the role sex plays in Olivia\u2019s life.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:39</time> How Olivia got into sex work  \n<time>08:41</time> Types of clients  \n<time>11:12</time> The interview with Candace Owens  \n<time>14:54</time> The pros and cons of sex work  \n<time>25:25</time> The traits of porn stars  \n<time>27:15</time> Is sex work exploitative?  \n<time>31:21</time> The traits of people who are against sex work  \n<time>36:49</time> Are porn stars \u201cdamaged goods\u201d?  \n<time>39:40</time> Transactional sex  \n<time>41:30</time> Relationships with clients  \n<time>46:48</time> Do we live in a promiscuous society?  \n<time>50:37</time> Feminism and sex work  \n<time>55:25</time> Can sex work be empowering?  \n<time>1:04:10</time> The role of sex  \n<time>1:05:41</time> Follow Olivia\u2019s work!\n\n---\n\nFollow Olivia\u2019s work:  \nWebsite: https://tinyurl.com/9hvfn7ap  \nTwitter handle: @OliviaBentleyBR\n",
