  \ we talk about linguistics. We start by covering some of the most prominent theories\
  \ of language, including nativism, constructivism, and functional theories. We then\
  \ discuss several aspects of native language attainment, and also how people acquire\
  \ second languages. We discuss specifically the role of education and inputs. Finally,\
  \ we discuss the \u201Cpoverty of the stimulus\u201D argument for nativism.\n\n\
