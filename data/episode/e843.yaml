  \nIn this episode, we focus on Human Extinction. We start by discussing how old\
  \ the idea of human extinction is in Western history. We then talk about five existential\
  \ moods across history, and get into anthropogenic extinction, natural causes of\
  \ extinction, and the existential mood of our current moment. We discuss what people\
  \ might mean by \u201Chuman\u201D and \u201Cextinction\u201D. Finally, we talk about\
  \ ideas in favor of human extinction.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:00  Intro  \n00:29  How\
