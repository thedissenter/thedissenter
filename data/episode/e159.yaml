shownotes: "Dr. Ian Crawford is Professor of Planetary Science and Astrobiology at\
  \ Birkbeck College, University of London. His research activities mostly lie in\
  \ the fields of space exploration (especially lunar science and exploration), and\
  \ the science of astrobiology (the search for life in the Universe).\n\nIn this\
  \ episode, we talk about astrobiology and Big History. What is astrobiology, and\
  \ the criteria that are used to search for life in the Universe, and also the limitations\
  \ of those criteria, including the Goldilocks conditions (or the habitable zone).\
  \ Also, the life forms that we should expect to find on other planets, and the places\
  \ in our solar system which have the highest probabilities of hosting life. The\
  \ special case of looking for intelligent life, and the many complications of it.\
  \ The scientific, societal and political relevance of lunar and space exploration,\
  \ and why it\u2019s not in conflict with other human social and political endeavors.\
  \ And, finally, Big History, and the relationship between astrobiology and Big History.\n\
