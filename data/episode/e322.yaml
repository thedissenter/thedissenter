shownotes: "RECORDED ON FEBRUARY 5th, 2020.\n\nDr. Curtis Marean is Foundation Professor\
  \ and Associate Director at the Institute of Human Origins at Arizona State University.\
  \ Dr. Marean\u2019s research interests focus on the origins of modern humans, the\
  \ prehistory of Africa, the study of animal bones from archaeological sites and\
  \ climates and environments of the past. In the area of the origins of modern humans,\
  \ he is particularly interested in questions about foraging strategies and the evolution\
  \ of modern human behavior. He has a special interest in human occupation of grassland\
  \ and coastal ecosystems.\n\nIn this episode, we start by talking about zooarchaeology,\
  \ and Integrating paleoanthropology, paleoclimate and paleoenvironments. We then\
  \ discuss the importance of stone tools and fire in human evolution. We also refer\
  \ to what it is to be a modern human. We address the limitations of foraging models.\
  \ We explore how culture might have evolved in humans. Finally, we talk about our\
  \ possible origins and migrations.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:59  What is zooarchaeology?\
