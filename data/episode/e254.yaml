  \ at the Department of Anthropology at the University of California, Santa Barbara,\
  \ chair of the Integrative Anthropological Sciences Unit, and also head of the Evolutionary\
  \ Anthropology and Biodemography Research Group. He is an evolutionary anthropologist\
  \ aiming to explain behavior and physiological systems as adaptive solutions to\
  \ competing demands of limited resource allocation. He employs ethnographic field\
  \ settings as laboratories for testing hypotheses about human variation in behavior,\
  \ psychology and physiology. Currently his research focuses on two broad, inter-related\
  \ areas: biodemography of human health, lifespan and aging; and transitions in social\
  \ and economic behavior. \n\nIn this episode, we first talk about limited resource\
  \ allocation, and how people have to make trade-offs when investing their material\
  \ and time resources. Then we discuss how we can use economic games to study human\
  \ behavior. We talk about marriage and the sexual division of labor, and also mate\
  \ preferences. We also cover a recent study about the relationship between wealth\
  \ inequality and polygyny. Finally, we discuss human personality, the problems with\
  \ the apparent lack of universality of the Big Five, and the niche diversity hypothesis\
  \ of personality. \n\nTime Links:  \n01:12  Trade-offs people make while deciding\
