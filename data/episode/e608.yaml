shownotes: "Dr. Moshe Hoffman is a Research Scientist at the Max Planck Institute\
  \ for Evolutionary Biology and Lecturer at Harvard's Department of Economics.\n\n\
  Dr. Erez Yoeli is a research scientist at MIT\u2019s Sloan School of Management,\
  \ where he directs the Applied Cooperation Team (ACT). His research focuses on altruism:\
  \ understanding how it works and how to promote it.\n\nThey are both authors of\
  \ Hidden Games: The Surprising Power of Game Theory to Explain Irrational Human\
  \ Behavior.\n\nIn this episode, we focus on Hidden Games. Topics include: aspects\
  \ of human behavior that game theory explains; motives and incentives, and why we\
  \ are oblivious to them; how learning shapes beliefs and tastes; rationality; spillovers;\
  \ primary and secondary rewards; proximate vs ultimate analyses; the emic-etic distinction;\
  \ Nash equilibrium; human cooperation; norms and punishment; why we process information\
  \ according to game-theoretic principles; moral philosophy from a game-theoretic\
  \ perspective; nudges; and beliefs, and where they come from.\n\nTime Links:  \n\
  00:00 Intro  \n00:53  What aspects of human behavior is game theory best suited\
  \ to explain?  \n03:08  Why are we so oblivious to the motives and incentives behind\
  \ our behavior?  \n05:40  How learning shapes beliefs and tastes  \n14:27  Rationality,\
  \ and functionality  \n17:20  Spillovers  \n20:34  Primary and secondary rewards\
  \  \n26:53  Proximate vs. ultimate analyses  \n29:02  The emic-etic distinction\
  \  \n31:42  Does what people say matter?  \n41:01  Nash equilibrium  \n45:18  What\
  \ sustains human cooperation  \n48:09  Norm enforcement, and punishment  \n1:00:09\
  \  Why does our brain process information according to game theory mechanisms? Are\
  \ these evolved?  \n1:06:10  Is moral philosophy simply emic?  \n1:14:52  Can we\
  \ use game theory to nudge people into making better choices and being more \u201C\
  moral\u201D?  \n1:20:02  What are beliefs, and where do they come from?  \n1:45:21\
