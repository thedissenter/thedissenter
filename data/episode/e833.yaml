  \ the first one here: https://youtu.be/04yvn-B7vRg\n\nIn this episode, we talk about\
  \ dynamical approaches in cognitive science. We start by discussing the differences\
  \ between computational-representational approaches and dynamical approaches in\
  \ cognitive science. We talk about 4E cognition. We then get into a recent paper\
  \ by Dr. Hip\xF3lito, Mind as Motion, and talk about a shift in psychology towards\
  \ dynamical approaches, and the role of the sociocultural context. We discuss if\
  \ psychological experiences have any intrinsic value, and if science is value-free\
  \ or independent of any sociocultural context. Finally, we discuss if AI systems\
  \ can become human-like if they are not embodied.\n\n\nTime Links:  \n00:00 Intro\
