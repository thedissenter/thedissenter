  \ Professor of Philosophy at Temple University. Previously, he was an Andrew W.\

  \ on Articulating a Thought. We start by talking about self-knowledge, how people\
  \ acquire it, and how it is approached philosophically. We then get into articulation,\
  \ and the reasoning behind articulating a thought. We also discuss why some thoughts\
  \ are easy to articulate, while others are very hard, the limits of language, and\
  \ clarity of thought.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:00 Intro  \n00:35  What is self-knowledge,\
