  \ Consultation: Encountering the Other in Mental Health Care.\n\nIn this episode,\
  \ we focus on Cultural Consultation. We first discuss what cultural psychiatry is,\
  \ why cultural diversity is a challenge to mental health care, and the different\
  \ approaches to addressing diversity in mental health services. We delve into the\
  \ challenges faced by migrants; how gender and ethnicity interact with hierarchies\
  \ of power, and why that matters in a clinical context; working with marginalized\
  \ communities; and working in rural and remote communities. We talk about how \u201C\
  healers\u201D can help with psychological issues, and the issues with psychological\
  \ traits that are stigmatized in certain cultural contexts. Finally, we discuss\
  \ if culture influences how mental disorders manifest themselves, and how the social\
  \ sciences can contribute to psychiatry.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:00 Intro  \n00:57\
