  \ \n\nIn this episode, we talk about game theory in the studying of animal social\
  \ behavior. Topics include cleaning mutualism in fish; the cognitive tools necessary\
  \ for social behavior; what are evolutionarily stable strategies; the importance\
  \ of the environment and development, and not just genetics; endocrinology and behavior;\
  \ one-on-one vs collective dynamics; group selection in humans.\n\nTime Links: \
