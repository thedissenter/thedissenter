  \ (HBE), and some specific aspects of human behavior that it addresses. We start\
  \ off by talking about the differences and the relationship between HBE and Evolutionary\
  \ Psychology (EP) and other similar and close sciences of human behavior. We address\
  \ the issue with studies done on WEIRD (Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich,\
  \ and Developed) and non-WEIRD societies; transcultural variation and human universals;\
  \ and comparing modern and natural environments. Then, we tackle specific topics\
  \ like human mating and reproduction; cooperative breeding and alloparenting in\
  \ humans; the developmental consequences of father absence; the evolution of menopause;\
  \ and other related topics.\n\nTime Links:  \n01:01  Human Behavioral Ecology, Evolutionary\
