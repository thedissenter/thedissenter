  \nThis is our second interview. You can watch the first one here: https://youtu.be/L7R-EKiYWNQ\n\
  \nIn this episode, we start by talking about the study of human demography, and\
  \ what we can learn from it. We discuss the myth of the nuclear family as the traditional\
  \ family structure, child rearing in traditional societies, if children really need\
  \ a parent from each sex at home, if father absence leads to poverty, and the negative\
  \ effects of this myth on children and parents. We talk about how gendered division\
  \ of labor develops in human societies. We discuss life history theory, and issues\
  \ in how it has been applied to humans. We talk about the strengths of the evolutionary\
  \ social sciences, and criticisms of the evolutionary social sciences, with a focus\
  \ on evolutionary psychology. We discuss the ties between the study of human demography\
  \ and the eugenics movement, and the recent academic resurgence of eugenics. Finally,\
  \ we discuss issues with the national IQ datasets created by Richard Lynn, and ideas\
  \ surrounding sex differences and representativeness in academia.\n\nTime Links:\
