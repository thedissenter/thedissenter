shownotes: "RECORDED ON JANUARY 23rd, 2020.  \nDr. Benjamin Bergen is Professor of\
  \ Cognitive Science at the University of California San Diego. His research interests\
  \ include language comprehension and production, including grammar, word meaning,\
  \ metaphor, profanity, and talking while driving. He\u2019s the author of the books\
  \ Louder Than Words: The New Science of How the Mind Makes Meaning, and What the\
  \ F: What Swearing Reveals About Our Language, Our Brains, and Ourselves.\n\nIn\
  \ this episode, we focus on embodied cognition and language. First, we tackle what\
  \ embodied cognition is about. Then, we get into language (and meaning). We refer\
  \ to the embodied simulation hypothesis, and to experiments to know the mental simulations\
  \ people are performing. We also discuss the drawbacks of mentalese (language of\
  \ thought). We ask if language influences thought, and how. We talk about different\
  \ cognitive styles \u2013 verbalizers, and visualizers \u2013 and ask how can we\
  \ even understand each other. In the final parts of the interview, we talk about\
  \ how we get from simulations of physical aspects of existence to abstract concepts;\
  \ what is embodied simulation really good for; and if we can improve AI systems\
  \ with knowledge from embodied cognition and simulation. \n\nTime Links:  \n00:48\
