  \ talk. You can watch the first one here: https://youtu.be/b5-tB-SrHyI\n\nThis time,\
  \ we focus on Rational Choice and Democratic Government. We talk about how old democracies\
  \ are. We define liberal democracy, and talk about political and civil rights. We\
  \ discuss the rise of democracies, the recent \u201Cdemocratic recession\u201D,\
  \ and the 2008 economic crisis. We discuss how levels of democracy are evaluated.\
  \ We get into rational choice theory, self-interest, and incentives. We discuss\
  \ explanations for the rise and spread of democracy. We talk about voting behavior,\
  \ and discuss how much we should worry about average voters being uninformed. We\
  \ discuss how both market failure and government failure occur. We talk about where\
  \ public choice analyses fail. We discuss if democracy contributes to peace. Finally,\
  \ we discuss if Francis Fukuyama was right, and if we should expect liberal-democratic\
  \ capitalist societies to be more successful than authoritarian state-capitalist\
  \ societies.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:00 Intro  \n01:04  How old are democracies?  \n\
