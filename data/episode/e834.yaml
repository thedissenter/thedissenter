excerpt: Dr. Kristen Lindquist is a Professor of Psychology and Neuroscience at the
  University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill. Her research seeks to understand the
  psychological and neural basis of emotions, moods, and feelings. Her ongoing work
  uses tools from social cognition, physiology, neuroscience, and big data methods
  to examine how emotions emerge from the confluence of the body, brain, and culture.

shownotes: "Dr. Kristen Lindquist is a Professor of Psychology and Neuroscience at\
  \ the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill. Her research seeks to understand\
  \ the psychological and neural basis of emotions, moods, and feelings. Her ongoing\
  \ work uses tools from social cognition, physiology, neuroscience, and big data\
  \ methods to examine how emotions emerge from the confluence of the body, brain,\
  \ and culture.\n\nIn this episode, we start by talking about a multidisciplinary\
  \ approach to emotions. We discuss if infants really perceive and understand facial\
  \ configurations as instances of discrete emotion categories, and why there is so\
  \ much focus on the face. We talk about the cross-cultural study of emotions. We\
  \ discuss how children acquire emotion concepts. We talk about emotional aging,\
  \ and an embodied cognitive approach to emotion. We discuss gender variation in\
  \ the experience of emotion. We talk about moral foundations theory, and an alternative\
  \ constructionist perspective on the link between morality and emotion. We discuss\
  \ if some people are more emotionally complex than others. We discuss if people\
  \ universally essentialize emotions, and research on basic emotions. We talk about\
  \ a network approach to the brain. Finally, we discuss gender gaps in representation\
  \ and career advancement in the sciences, and what explains them.\n\nTime Links:\
