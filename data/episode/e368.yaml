  University, Dr. Tattersall has concentrated his research since the 1960s in three
  main areas: the analysis of the human fossil record and its integration with evolutionary
  theory, the origin of human cognition, and the study of the ecology and systematics
  of the lemurs of Madagascar. He is also a prominent interpreter of human paleontology

  \ emeritus in the Division of Anthropology of the American Museum of Natural History\
  \ in New York City. He has carried out both primatological and paleontological fieldwork\
  \ in countries as diverse as Madagascar, Vietnam, Surinam, Yemen, and Mauritius.\
  \ Trained in archaeology and anthropology at the University of Cambridge, and in\
  \ geology and vertebrate paleontology at Yale University, Dr. Tattersall has concentrated\

  \ \n\nIn this episode, we talk about the study of the human fossil record, and several\
  \ aspects of human evolution, with a focus on the genus Homo. We discuss how the\
  \ Pleistocene conditions might have affected human evolution; the role of culture;\
  \ and the cognitive revolution. We also refer to what is a modern human, and the\
  \ evolution of language and symbolism. Finally, we tackle narratives in the paleosciences,\
  \ like the one about human races and the relative importance of natural selection\
  \ in comparison with cultural selection.\n\nTime Links:  \n01:27  Studying the human\
