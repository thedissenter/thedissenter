excerpt: 'Dr. Khandis Blake is an evolutionary social psychologist at The University
  of Melbourne. She is an expert in gendered conflict. Her research considers how
  behavior, attitudes, and culture associated with gender are influenced by the interplay
  between nature, nurture, and the state of the economy. Herself and her collaborators
  propose that gendered phenomena such as inimate partner violence, attitudes toward
  abortion, and male-male aggression arise partially out of market conditions that
  shift the bargaining power between men and women. Second, she investigates the causes
  and consequences of female competition and the conditions under which female sexualization
  elevates women''s agency. Third, she develops methodological tools to advance the
  psychosocial study of female ovulation and ovarian hormones. Finally, she is interested
  in the social contexts eliciting aggression, especially male-to-female aggression
  and intimate partner violence.  '

  \ social psychologist at The University of Melbourne. She is an expert in gendered\
  \ conflict. Her research considers how behavior, attitudes, and culture associated\
  \ with gender are influenced by the interplay between nature, nurture, and the state\
  \ of the economy. Herself and her collaborators propose that gendered phenomena\
  \ such as inimate partner violence, attitudes toward abortion, and male-male aggression\
  \ arise partially out of market conditions that shift the bargaining power between\

  \ competition and the conditions under which female sexualization elevates women's\
  \ agency. Third, she develops methodological tools to advance the psychosocial study\
  \ of female ovulation and ovarian hormones. Finally, she is interested in the social\
  \ contexts eliciting aggression, especially male-to-female aggression and intimate\
  \ partner violence.  \n\nIn this episode, we talk about several issues regarding\
  \ female intrasexual competition in the modern world, gender inequality, and feminism\
  \ from an evolutionary perspective. We first discuss how women compete, and focus\
  \ on aggressive behavior. We then talk about intimate partner violence. We cover\
  \ income inequality and effects on women\u2019s intrasexual competition at several\
  \ different levels, like the use of cosmetics and social media. We also explore\
  \ sexual objectification, and hypersexualization in the West and the negative effects\
  \ it might have on women. Finally, we talk about integrating Women\u2019s Studies\
  \ with Evolutionary Psychology to better understand and tackle current feminist\
  \ issues.\n\nTime Links:  \n01:41  Female intrasexual competition  \n04:09  Aggression\
