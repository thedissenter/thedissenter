shownotes: "RECORDED ON JUNE 15th 2021.  \nDr. Rebecca Owens is Lecturer in Psychology\
  \ at the University of Sunderland. She is also a Chartered member of the British\
  \ Psychological Society and a Senior Fellow of the Higher Education Academy. Her\
  \ interests include mating behaviors, preferences, and strategies; male psychology;\
  \ and body image/identity and wellbeing. \n\nIn this episode, we talk about sex\
  \ differences in mating behavior, male psychology, and the psychology of body modifications.\
  \ We first discuss sex differences in mating strategies and mate preferences, for\
  \ both short-term and long-term relationships. We then get into male psychology,\
  \ and discuss the effects of testosterone and how it varies in romantic relationships.\
  \ We discuss aggression, and the misconceptions people hold about aggressive males,\
  \ and issues regarding domestic violence. We also talk about sex differences in\
  \ competition. We ask about the psychological impact of gender roles, and if the\
  \ concept of \u201Ctoxic masculinity\u201D is useful in any way. Finally, we talk\
  \ about the psychology of body modifications, and their impact on mental wellbeing.\n\
