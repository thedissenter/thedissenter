shownotes: "RECORDED ON DECEMBER 4th 2020.  \nDr. Steven J. Heine is Distinguished\
  \ University Scholar and Professor of Social and Cultural Psychology at the University\
  \ of British Columbia. Heine\u2019s pioneering research has challenged key psychological\
  \ assumptions in self-esteem, meaning, and the ways that people understand genetic\
  \ constructs. He is the author of many acclaimed journal articles and books in the\
  \ fields of social and cultural psychology including Cultural Psychology, the top-selling\
  \ textbook in the field. In 2016, he was elected as a Fellow of the Royal Society\
  \ of Canada.\n\nIn this episode, we talk about Cultural Psychology. We start with\
  \ some basic questions, regarding the field of cultural psychology, and what is\
  \ culture. We then go through several topics like: where does cultural variation\
  \ come from?; ways of classifying different cultures; differences in psychological\
  \ mechanisms influenced by culture, and if these are permanent; a sensitive period\
  \ for acculturation; and how cultures have changed over time. We talk about specific\
  \ psychological mechanisms whose universality has recently been questioned, including:\
  \ the endowment effect; the similarity-attraction effect; overconfidence; cognitive\
  \ dissonance; the fundamental attribution error; and how people experience mental\
  \ illness. Toward the end we also discuss how ideas spread in societies, and I ask\
  \ Dr. Heine what are some of the most interesting questions that Cultural Psychology\
  \ has yet to answer.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:53  What is Cultural Psychology?  \n02:01\
