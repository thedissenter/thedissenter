  \ social learning and cultural evolution.\n\nIn this episode, we talk about social\
  \ learning, mate copying, and culture. We start by discussing social learning from\
  \ an evolutionary perspective. We get into the specific example of mate copying,\
  \ and how it occurs in Drosophila. We get into the factors that play a role in it;\
  \ if rejections are also copied; and how choosers can deceive the copiers. We then\
  \ talk about social learning, culture, conformity, and traditions in non-human animals,\
  \ and how to understand culture from a biological perspective. We discuss if mate\
  \ copying can have implications for the study of evolved mate preferences, and sexual\
  \ selection. Finally, we discuss if by studying culture and cultural transmission\
  \ in non-human animals can we get new insights into human culture.\n\nTime Links:\
