  \ of Social Psychology at VU Amsterdam. Dr. Molho is a psychologist studying human\
  \ cooperation, morality, and the role of emotions in decision-making. She draws\

  \ moral emotions, and human cooperation. We start with norms, and their social functions.\
  \ We talk about norm violations, and punishment. We get into the moral emotions\
  \ of disgust and anger. We discuss how disgust sensitivity might link to opposition\
  \ to immigration. We also talk about cooperation in contexts of hierarchy and power\
  \ asymmetries, and Interdependence Theory and human cooperation.\n\nTime Links:\
