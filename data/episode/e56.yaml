  \ the properties of moral axioms; the ethics of religion; the internal contradictions\
  \ of moral relativism; the condition of nihilism; free will and personal responsibility;\
  \ truth and cruelty; pleasure in ethics; religion, science, and the meaning of life;\
  \ the philosophical problem of immortality; and the relationship between beauty,\
