  \ in children and adolescents. We refer to the important contributions of genes\
  \ and the environment, and the many complications associated with studying the different\
  \ factors; the \u201Cstages\u201D approach in developmental psychology; and the\
  \ development of gender. We also talk about peer pressure, and the shared and non-shared\
  \ environments; different social cognitions; and, finally, if development still\
  \ occurs in adulthood.\n\nTime Links:  \n01:02  Prosocial and moral development\
