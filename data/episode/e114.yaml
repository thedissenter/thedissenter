  \  \nIn this episode, we focus on The Enigma of Reason, and talk about how reason\
  \ might have evolved, and its cognitive and social function. We talk a little bit\
  \ about the notion of the modular mind. Also, how cognition operates at a subconscious\
  \ level; the conditions in which reason works best; if dual-process theory (the\
  \ idea of us having two different cognitive systems \u2013 one more fast and frugal,\
  \ and the other more deliberative) makes sense from this new perspective; what really\
  \ is a \u201Crational\u201D behavior; and why science as a human enterprise works\
  \ so well.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:49  How did reason evolve?  \n02:18  What is reason?\
