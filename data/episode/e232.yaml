  \nIn this episode, we focus on Dr. Geher\u2019s recent book, Positive Evolutionary\
  \ Psychology. We talk about the history and the topics of interest of the field\
  \ of Positive Psychology, and what Evolutionary Psychology adds to the picture.\
  \ We address a potential criticism, having to do with Positive Evolutionary Psychology\
  \ being a scientific field with a moral goal. Then we get into the nitty-gritty\
  \ of the thesis of the book, and talk about the importance of integrating the negative\
  \ aspects of our psychology; considering individual differences; the issue of evolutionary\
  \ mismatch; politics; religion; our evolved morality, and how we can expand our\
  \ moral circles; and the literature on estrangements and the importance of making\
  \ amends. Dr. Geher leaves us with some remarks on the nefarious aspects of modern\
  \ technology. \n\nTime Links:  \n01:17  The history of Positive Psychology  \n12:28\
