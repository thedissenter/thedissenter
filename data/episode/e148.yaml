  \nIn this episode, we focus on anti-natalism, and its several ramifications. We\
  \ tackle the asymmetry argument from different angles. We talk about how we are\
  \ predisposed to evaluate life, and if we can do it objectively. We establish a\
  \ distinction between a life worth continuing and a life worth starting. And we\
  \ also go through some specific topics like life for nonhuman animals, abortion,\
  \ suicide, euthanasia, and environmentalism. \n\nTime Links:  \n01:01  The anti-natalist\
