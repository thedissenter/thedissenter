shownotes: "RECORDED ON March 3rd, 2020.  \nDr. Steven Pinker is a Johnstone Family\
  \ Professor in the Department of Psychology at Harvard University. He conducts research\
  \ on language and cognition, writes for publications such as the New York Times,\
  \ Time and The Atlantic, and is the author of ten books, including The Language\
  \ Instinct, How The Mind Works, The Blank Slate, The Stuff of Thought, The Better\
  \ Angels of Our Nature, The Sense of Style, and most recently, Enlightenment Now:\
  \ The Case for Reason, Science, Humanism, and Progress.\n\nIn this episode, we go\
  \ through some of the main topics Dr. Pinker tackles in his work. We start by discussing\
  \ a new hypothesis put forth by Joe Henrich and his collaborators, about the possible\
  \ influence the Catholic Church had on the evolution of our WEIRD psychology and\
  \ the Enlightenment ideas. We then talk about cultural evolution, morality from\
  \ an evolutionary perspective, and human progress. We also address if our folk psychology\
  \ tracks scientific findings on human behavior. We also talk about language, and\
  \ AI. Finally, we go through two questions coming from a patron, about the cognitive\
  \ niche hypothesis, and the WEIRD problem.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:44  The Catholic\
  \ Church and the Enlightenment  \n07:40  Where did the ideas of the Enlightenment\
  \ come from?  \n10:39  On cultural evolution and human nature  \n17:31  Morality\
  \ from an evolutionary perspective  \n25:13  Can we backslide in terms of human\
  \ progress?  \n30:28  Does our folk psychology track scientific findings?  \n36:04\
  \  About the idea of massive modularity of the human mind  \n39:54  Language  \n\
  43:46  What if we were to reproduce the human brain in an artificial medium?  \n\
  47:11  Questions from patrons (the cognitive niche hypothesis, and the WEIRD problem)\
