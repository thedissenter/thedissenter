shownotes: "RECORDED ON JUNE 27th 2022.  \nDr. Hector Qirko is Professor of Anthropology\
  \ at the College of Charleston. His research interests include applied anthropology,\
  \ organizational and institutional cultures, evolutionary theory and cultural patterning,\
  \ and popular culture and identity.\n\nIn this episode, we talk about the evolution\
  \ of altruism. We start by talking about the most prominent evolutionary theories\
  \ of human cooperation. We discuss how we can study intentional communities as a\
  \ source of data about the evolution of cooperation. We get into altruistic punishment,\
  \ kinship, fictive kinship, kin recognition, kin cues, and how they relate to the\
  \ success of institutions. We discuss explanations for extreme altruism, like religious\
  \ celibacy. Finally, we talk about the problem of cultural particularism in anthropology.\n\
