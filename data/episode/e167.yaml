  \ (2018).\n\nIn this episode, we talk about the philosophy of causation, and a new\
  \ approach to causation in philosophy and science developed by Dr. Lill Anjum in\
  \ collaboration with Dr. Stephen Mumford, based on a metaphysics of powers or dispositions.\
  \ We discuss how we should think about causality when there are several factors\
  \ acting on a particular phenomenon; the intrinsic limitations of scientific models\
  \ of the world; how can shifting from neuron diagrams of causal relations to vectors\
  \ might improve those same models; and reductionism and emergentism. Throughout\
  \ the interview, Dr. Lill Anjum illustrates all of these issues with examples coming\
  \ from medicine, an area she has been focusing a lot of her work on causation recently.\n\
