excerpt: Dr. Melanie MacEacheron is a Lecturer in the School of Social and Behavioral
  Sciences at Arizona State University. Her current research focus is women's psychology
  as potential or actual mothers or allomothers, and sex differences in mateships
  and romantic relationships. Of particular interest to her, is our ability to creatively
  label or act on evolved desires in order to serve our evolutionary interests, even
  or especially where these are not consciously known to us, and to influence others.

shownotes: "RECORDED ON APRIL 27th 2022.  \nDr. Melanie MacEacheron is a Lecturer\
  \ in the School of Social and Behavioral Sciences at Arizona State University. Her\
  \ current research focus is women's psychology as potential or actual mothers or\
  \ allomothers, and sex differences in mateships and romantic relationships. Of particular\
  \ interest to her, is our ability to creatively label or act on evolved desires\
  \ in order to serve our evolutionary interests, even or especially where these are\
  \ not consciously known to us, and to influence others.\n\nIn this episode, we focus\
  \ mostly on motherhood and marital surname changes. We start with the questions\
  \ that the evolutionary psychology of motherhood focusses on, and also discuss allomothering.\
  \ We talk about sex differences in mateships and romantic relationships. We discuss\
  \ marital surname changes and several factors and predictors associated with them,\
  \ like earning capacity and economic inequality. We also discuss outcomes like marital\
  \ duration, and number of children. Finally, we ask if feminism and evolutionary\
  \ psychology really need to be in conflict with one another.\n\nTime Links:  \n\
