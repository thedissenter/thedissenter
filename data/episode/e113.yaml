  \ of disgust, from an evolutionary perspective; the relationship between disgust\
  \ and morality, and between disgust and political attitudes; sex differences in\
  \ disgust sensitivity. We also talk about politics and science, and the problem\
  \ of our own political preferences contaminating scientific research, and the importance\
  \ of giving social psychology a biological basis.  \n\nTime Links:  \n01:18  The\
