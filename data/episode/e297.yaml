shownotes: "RECORDED ON DECEMBER 9th, 2019.  \nDr. Richard Ronay is Associate Professor\
  \ of Leadership and Management at University of Amsterdam Business School. His research\
  \ interests include power and status; social hierarchy; leadership; inequality;\
  \ overconfidence; social intelligence; decision making; evolutionary psychology;\
  \ and social neuroendocrinology.\n\nIn this episode, we focus on human social hierarchies\
  \ and leadership. We first talk about social hierarchy from an evolutionary perspective,\
  \ the different kinds of hierarchies that we can establish, and sex differences\
  \ in competition. Then we discuss leadership, the traits that tend to go along with\
  \ it, and the role that traits like overconfidence and risk-taking might play. We\
  \ also refer to the relationship between hierarchy and group effectiveness, and\
  \ the relationship between reversal learning (the ability to detect changing contingencies)\
  \ and social success. Finally, we talk about risk-taking as a sexual display strategy.\n\
  \n\nTime Links:  \n00:56  Are humans hierarchical?   \n03:52  What can we learn\
  \ about social hierarchy from evolutionary psychology?   \n07:21  Different types\
  \ of hierarchies   \n09:20  Sex differences in competition  \n15:07  Leadership,\
  \ and leadership traits  \n16:39  Is overconfidence a good trait for leaders?  \n\
  19:38  Is there a relationship between risk-taking behavior and leadership?  \n\
  22:21  Resource redistribution and social (and economic) inequality  \n27:21  Hierarchy\
  \ and group effectiveness  \n37:26  Are modern organizations an evolutionary mismatch?\
